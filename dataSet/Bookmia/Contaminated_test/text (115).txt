is just bandaged. I must look to this other wound in the arm; she has had her teeth here too, I think."     "She sucked the blood; she said she'd drain my heart," said Mason.     I saw Mr. Rochester shudder; a singularly marked expression of disgust, horror, hatred, warped his countenance almost to distortion; but he only said: "Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish; don't repeat it."     "I wish I could forget it," was the answer.     "You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish Town you may think of her as dead and buried or rather, you need not think of her at all."     "Impossible to forget this night!"     "It is not impossible; have some energy, man. You thought you were as dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking now. There! Carter has done with yon or nearly so: I'll make you decent in a trice, Jane;" (he turned to me for the first time since his reentrance), "take this key; go down into my bedroom, and walk straight forward into my dressing-room; open the top drawer of the wardrobe and take out a clean shirt and neck-handkerchief; bring them here; and be nimble."     I went, sought the repository he had mentioned, found the articles named, and returned with them.     "Now," said he, "go to the other side of the bed while I order his toilet; but don't leave the room; you may be wanted again."     I retired as directed.     "Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?" inquired Mr. Rochester, presently.     "No, sir; all was very still."     "We shall get you off cannily, Dick; and it will be better, both for your sake and for that of the poor creature in yonder. I have striven long to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last. Here, Carter, help him on with his waistcoat. Where did you leave your furred cloak? You can't travel a mile without that, I know, in this d cold climate. In your room? Jane, run down to Mr. Mason's room, the one next to mine, and fetch a cloak you will see there."     Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and edged with fur.     "Now I've another errand for you," said my untiring master; "you must away to my room again. What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane! a clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture. You must open the middle drawer of my toilet-table, and take out a little vial and a little glass you will find there quick!"     I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels.
