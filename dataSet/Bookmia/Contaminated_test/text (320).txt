    "Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict a chastisement beyond mortal endurance."     "Ha! explain!" commanded the lady.     "Pardon me, madam; no need of explanation; your own fine sense must inform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for capital punishment."     "Sing!" said she, and again touching the piano she commenced an accompaniment in spirited style.     "Now is my time to slip away," thought I; but the tones that then severed the air arrested me. Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester possessed a fine voice; he did a mellow, powerful bass, into which he threw his own feeling, his own force; finding a way through the ear to the heart, and there waking sensation strangely.
