You got me in de go-long.” At the newel post Janie whirled around and for the space Their Eyes Were Watching God 125 of a thought she was lit up like a transfiguration. Her next thought brought her crashing down. He’s just saying anything for the time being, feeling he’s got me so I’ll b’lieve him. The next thought buried her under tons of cold futility. He’s trading on being younger than me. Getting ready to laugh at me for an old fool. But oh, what wouldn’t I give to be twelve years younger so I could b’lieve him! “Aw, Tea Cake, you just say dat tuhnight because de fish and corn bread tasted sort of good.
