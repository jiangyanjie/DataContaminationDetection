You just wants to hug and kiss and feel around with first one man and then another, huh? You wants to make me suck de same Their Eyes Were Watching God 17 sorrow yo’ mama did, eh? Mah ole head ain’t gray enough. Mah back ain’t bowed enough to suit yuh!” The vision of Logan Killicks was desecrating the pear tree, but Janie didn’t know how to tell Nanny that.
