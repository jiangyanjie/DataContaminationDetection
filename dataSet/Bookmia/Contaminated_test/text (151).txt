was to make me happy; I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely place such as the moon, for instance and it nodded its head toward her horn, rising over Hay Hill; it told me of the alabaster cave and silver vale where we might live. I said I should like to go, but reminded it as you did me, that I had no wings to fly.     "'Oh,' returned the fairy,' that does not signify! Here is a talisman will remove all difficulties;' and she held out a pretty gold ring. 'Put it,' she said, 'on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.' She nodded again at the moon. The ring, Adle, is in my breeches-pocket, under the disguise of a sovereign, but I mean soon to change it to a ring again."     "But what has mademoiselle to do with it? I don't care for the fairy; you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon."     "Mademoiselle is a fairy," he said, whispering mysteriously. Whereupon I told her not to mind his badinage; and she, on her part, evinced a fund of genuine French skepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester "un vrai menteur," and assuring him that she had made no account whatever of his "Contes de fe," and that "du reste, il n'y avait pas de fes, et quand mme il y en avait," she was sure they would never appear to him, nor ever give him rings, or offer to live with him in the moon.     The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me. Mr. Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse; there I was ordered to choose half a dozen dresses. I hated the business, I begged leave to defer it; no it should be gone through with now. By dint of entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to two; these, however, he vowed he would select himself. With anxiety I watched his eye rove over the gay stores; he fixed on a rich silk of the most brilliant amethyst dve and a superb pink satin. I told him in a new series of whispers that he might as well buy me a gold gown and silver bonnet at once; I should certainly never venture to wear his choice. With infinite difficulty, for he was stubborn as a stone, I persuaded him to make an exchange in favor of a sober black satin and pearl-gray silk. "It might pass for the present," he said, "but he would yet see me glittering like a parterre."     Glad was I to get to get him out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a jeweler's shop; the more he bought me, the more my cheek burned with a sense of annoyance and degradation. As we re-entered the
