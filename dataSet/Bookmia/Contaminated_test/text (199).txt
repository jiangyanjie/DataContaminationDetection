come in handy now, but new words would have to be made and said to fit them. “Green Cove Springs,” he told the driver. So they were married there before sundown, just like Joe had said. With new clothes of silk and wool. They sat on the boarding house porch and saw the sun plunge into the same crack in the earth from which the night emerged. 5 On the train the next day, Joe didn’t make many speeches with rhymes to her, but he bought her the best things the butcher had, like apples and a glass lantern full of candies. Mostly he talked about plans for the town when he got there. They were bound to need somebody like him. Janie took a lot of looks at him and she was proud of what she saw. Kind of portly like rich white folks. Strange trains, and people and places didn’t scare him neither. Where they got off the train at Maitland he found a buggy to carry them over to the colored town right away. It was early in the afternoon when they got there, so Joe said they must walk over the place and look around. They locked arms and strolled from end to end of the town. Joe noted the scant dozen of shame-faced houses scattered in the sand and palmetto roots and said, “God, they call this a town?

Hicks is the name. Guv’nor Amos Hicks from Buford, South Carolina. Free, single, disengaged.” “I god, Ah ain’t nowhere near old enough to have no grown daughter. This here is mah wife.” Hicks sank back and lost interest at once. “Where is de Mayor?” Starks persisted. “Ah wants tuh talk wid him.” “Youse uh mite too previous for dat,” Coker told him. “Us ain’t got none yit.” “Ain’t got no Mayor! Well, who tells y’all what to do?” “Nobody. Everybody’s grown. And then agin, Ah reckon us just ain’t thought about it. Ah know Ah ain’t.” “Ah did think about it one day,” Hicks said dreamily, “but then Ah forgot it and ain’t thought about it since then.” “No wonder things ain’t no better,” Joe commented. “Ah’m buyin’ in here, and buyin’ in big.
