or two details from you. It is really too early for this talk, but I wish to set your mind at rest so that we can proceed with the task of repairing your body without bothering too much about your mind.' Nurse Gibson pulled up a chair for the doctor and left the room. 'You have been here about two days,' continued the doctor. 'Your car was found by a farmer on the way to market in Royale and he informed the police. After some delay Monsieur Mathis heard that it was your car and he immediately went to Les Noctambules with his men. You and Le Chiffre were found and also your friend, Miss Lynd, who was unharmed and according to her account suffered no molestation. She was prostrated with shock, but is now fully recovered and is at her hotel. She has been instructed by her superiors in London to stay at Royale under your orders until you are sufficiently recovered to go back to England.

'For how long were you maltreated?' 'About an hour,' said Bond. 'Then it is remarkable that you are alive and I congratulate you. Few men could have supported what you have been through. Perhaps that is some consolation. As Monsieur Mathis can tell you, I have had in my time to treat a number of patients who have suffered similar and not one has come through it as you have done.' The doctor looked at Bond for a moment and then turned brusquely to Mathis. 'You may have ten minutes and then you will be forcibly elected. If you put the patient's temperature up, you will answer for it.' He gave them both a broad smile and left the room. Mathis came over and took the doctor's chair. 'That's a good man,' said Bond. 'I like him.' 'He's attached to the Bureau,' said Mathis. 'He is a
