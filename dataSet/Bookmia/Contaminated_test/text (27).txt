and if this Count and his lady had a hand in it . . . The conversation in the Baron's box was remote movement to Feyd-Rautha, the voices drowned in the foot-stamping chant that came now from all around: "Head! Head! Head! Head!" The Baron scowled, seeing the way Feyd-Rautha turned to him. Languidly, controlling his rage with difficulty, the Baron waved his hand toward the young man standing in the arena beside the sprawled body of the slave. Give the boy a head. He earned it by exposing the slavemaster. Feyd-Rautha saw the signal of agreement, thought: They think they honor me. Let them see what I think! He saw his handlers approaching with a saw-knife to do the honors, waved them back, repeated the gesture as they hesitated. They think they honor me with just a head! he thought. He bent and crossed the gladiator's hands around the protruding knife handle, then removed the knife and placed it in the limp hands. It was done in an instant, and he straightened, beckoned his handlers. "Bury this slave intact with his knife in his hands," he said. "The man earned it." In the golden box, Count Fenring leaned close to the Baron, said: "A grand gesture, that--true bravura. Your nephew has style as well as courage." "He insults the crowd by refusing the head," the Baron muttered. "Not at all," Lady Fenring said. She turned, looking up at the tiers around them. And the Baron noted the line of her neck--a truly lovely flowing of muscles--like a young boy's. "They like what your nephew did," she said. As the import of Feyd-Rautha's gesture penetrated to the most distant seats, as the people saw the handlers carrying off the dead gladiator intact, the Baron watched them and realized she had interpreted the reaction correctly. The people were going wild, beating on each other, screaming and stamping. The Baron spoke wearily. "I shall have to order a fete. You cannot send people home like this, their energies unspent. They must see that I share their elation." He gave a hand signal to his guard, and a servant above them dipped the Harkonnen orange pennant over the box--once, twice, three times--signal for a fete. Feyd-Rautha crossed the arena to stand beneath the golden box, his weapons sheathed, arms hanging at his sides. Above the undiminished frenzy of the crowd, he called: "A fete, Uncle?" The noise began to subside as people saw the conversation and waited. "In your honor, Feyd!" the Baron called down. And again, he caused the pennant to be dipped in signal. Across the arena, the pru-barriers had been dropped and young men were leaping down into the arena, racing toward Feyd-Rautha. "You ordered the pru-shields dropped. Baron?" the Count asked. "No one will harm the lad," the Baron said. "He's a hero." The first of the charging mass reached Feyd-Rautha, lifted him on their shoulders, began parading around the arena. "He could walk unarmed and unshielded through the poorest quarters of Harko tonight," the Baron said. "They'd give him the
