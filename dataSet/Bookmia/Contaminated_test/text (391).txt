beddyhouse. Happy. Happy. That was the night ... --O, Mr Bloom, how do you do? --O, how do you do, Mrs Breen? --No use complaining. How is Molly those times? Haven't seen her for ages. --In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily. Milly has a position down in Mullingar, you know. --Go away! Isn't that grand for her? --Yes. In a photographer's there. Getting on like a house on fire. How are all your charges? --All on the baker's list, Mrs Breen said. How many has she? No other in sight. --You're in black, I see. You have no ... --No, Mr Bloom said. I have just come from a funeral. Going to crop up all day, I foresee. Who's dead, when and what did he die of? Turn up like a bad penny. --O, dear me, Mrs Breen said. I hope it wasn't any near relation. May as well get her sympathy. --Dignam, Mr Bloom said. An old friend of mine. He died quite suddenly, poor fellow. Heart trouble, I believe. Funeral was this morning. YOUR FUNERAL'S TOMORROW WHILE YOU'RE COMING THROUGH THE RYE.

Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way. Pleasure or pain is it? Penny dinner. Knife and fork chained to the table. Opening her handbag, chipped leather. Hatpin: ought to have a guard on those things. Stick it in a chap's eye in the tram. Rummaging. Open. Money. Please take one. Devils if they lose sixpence. Raise Cain. Husband barging. Where's the ten shillings I gave you on Monday? Are you feeding your little brother's family? Soiled handkerchief: medicinebottle. Pastille that was fell. What is she? ... --There must be a new moon out, she said. He's always bad then. Do you know what he did last night? Her hand ceased to rummage. Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in alarm, yet smiling. --What? Mr Bloom asked. Let her speak. Look straight in her eyes. I believe you. Trust me. --Woke me up in the night, she said. Dream he had, a nightmare. Indiges. --Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs. --The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.
