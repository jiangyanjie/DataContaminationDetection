amber liquid. Brandy? Whiskey? I have no idea. One long leg is crossed at the ankle over his knee. He’s wearing black socks and dress shoes. His right el- bow rests on the arm of the chair, his hand up to his chin, and he’s slowly running his index finger rhythmically back and forth over his lower lip. In the early morn- ing light, his eyes burn with grave intensity but his general expression is com- pletely unreadable. My heart almost stops. He’s here. How did he get here? He must have left New York last night. How long has he been here watching me sleep? “Hi,” I whisper. He regards me coolly, and my heart stutters once more. Oh no. He moves his long fingers away from his mouth, tosses back the remainder of his drink, and places the glass on the bedside table. I half expect him to kiss me, but he doesn’t. He sits back, continuing to regard me, his expression impassive. “Hello,” he says finally, his voice hushed. And I know he’s still mad. Really mad. “You’re back.” “It would appear so.” 211/551 Slowly I pull myself up into a sitting position, not taking my eyes off him. My mouth is dry. “How long have you been sitting there watching me sleep?” “Long enough.” “You’re still mad.” I can hardly speak the words. He gazes at me, as if considering his response. “Mad,” he says as if testing the word, weighing up its nuances, its meaning. “No, Ana. I am way, way beyond mad.” Holy crap.

I reach over to my glass of water and take a welcome sip, trying to bring my erratic heart rate under control. “Ryan caught Jack.” I try a different tack, and I place my glass beside his on the bedside table. “I know,” he says icily. Of course, he knows. “Are you going to be monosyllabic for long?” His eyebrows move fractionally registering his surprise as if he hadn’t expec- ted this question. “Yes,” he says finally. Oh . . . okay. What to do? Defense—the best form of attack. “I’m sorry I stayed out.” “Are you?” “No,” I mutter after a pause, because it’s true. “Why say it then?” “Because I don’t want you to be mad at me.” He sighs heavily as if he’s been holding this tension for a thousand hours and runs his hand through his hair. He looks beautiful. Mad, but beautiful. I drink him in—Christian’s back—angry, but in one piece. “I think Detective Clark wants to talk to you.” “I’m sure he does.” “Christian, please . . .” “Please what?” “Don’t be so cold.” His eyebrows rise in surprise once more. “Anastasia, cold is not what I’m feeling at the moment.
