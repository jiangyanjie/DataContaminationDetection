return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlor; ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation. The vehement ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me. Imust enter.     "Who could want me?" I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the stiff door-handle, which for a second or two resisted my efforts. "What should I see besides aunt Reed in the apartment? a man or a woman? The handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and courtesying low, I looked up at a black pillar! such, at least, appeared to me, at first sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug; the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft by way of capital.     Mrs. Reed occupied her usual seat by the fireside; she made a signal to me to approach; I did so, and she introduced me to the stony stranger with the words: "This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to you."     He(for it was a man) turned his head slowly toward where I stood, and having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking gray eyes which twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice, "Her size is small; what is her age?"     "Ten years."     "So much?" was the doubtful answer; and he prolonged his scrutiny for some minutes. Presently he addressed me:     "Your name, little girl?"     "Jane Eyre, sir."     In uttering these words I looked up. He seemed to me a tall gentleman: but then I was very little; his features were large, and they and all the lines of his frame were equally harsh and prim.     "Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?"     Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative my little world held a contrary opinion I was silent. Mrs. Reed answered for me by an expressive shake of the head, adding soon, "Perhaps the less said on that subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst."     "Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;" and bending from the perpendicular, he installed his person in the arm-chair, opposite Mrs. Reed's. "Come here," he said.     I stepped across the rug; he placed me straight and square before him. What a face he had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a great nose! and what a mouth! and what large, prominent teeth!     "No sight so sad as that of a naughty child," he began, "especially a naughty little girl. Do you know where the wicked go after death?"     "They go to hell" was my ready and orthodox answer.     "And what is hell? Can you tell me that?"
