He sighs. “I got an e-mail from Detective Clark. He wants to talk to you about that fucker Hyde.” “Really?” I sit back to gaze at Christian. “Yes. I told him you’re in Portland for the time being, so he’ll have to wait. But he says he’d like to interview you here.” “He’s coming here?” “Apparently so.” Christian looks bemused. I frown. “What’s so important that can’t wait?” “Exactly.” “When’s he coming?” “Today. I’ll e-mail him back.” “I have nothing to hide. I wonder what he wants to know?” “We’ll find out when he gets here. I’m intrigued, too.” Christian shifts again. “Breakfast will be here shortly. Let’s eat, then we can go and see your dad.” I nod. “You can stay here if you want. I can see you’re busy.” He scowls. “No, I want to come with you.” “Okay.” I grin, and wrap my arms around his neck and kiss him. Ray is bad-tempered. It’s a joy. He’s itchy, scratchy, impatient, and uncomfortable. “Dad, you’ve been in a major car accident. It will take time to heal. Christian and I want to move you to Seattle.” “I don’t know why you’re bothering with me. I’ll be fine here on my own.” “Don’t be ridiculous.” I squeeze his hand fondly, and he has the grace to smile at me. “Do you need anything?” “I could murder a doughnut, Annie.” I grin indulgently at him. “I’ll get you a doughnut or two. We’ll go to Voodoo.” “Great!” “You want some decent coffee, too?” “Hell yeah!” “Okay, I’ll go get some.” 385/551 Christian is once more in the waiting room, talking on the phone. He really should set up office in here. Weirdly, he’s by himself, although the other ICU beds are occupied. I wonder if Christian’s frightened off the other visitors. He hangs up. “Clark will be here at four this afternoon.” I frown. What could be so urgent? “Okay. Ray wants coffee and doughnuts.” Christian laughs. “I think I would too if I’d been in an accident. Ask Taylor to go.” “No, I’ll go.” “Take Taylor with you.” His voice is stern. “Okay.” I roll my eyes and he glares. Then he smirks and cocks his head to one side. “There’s no one here.” His voice is deliciously low, and I know he’s threaten- ing to spank me. I am about to dare him, when a young couple enters the room. She is weeping softly. I shrug apologetically at Christian, and he nods. He picks up his laptop, takes my hand, and leads me out of the room. “They need the privacy more than we do,” Christian murmurs. “We’ll have our fun later.” Outside Taylor is waiting patiently. “Let’s all go get coffee and doughnuts.” At four o’clock precisely there’s a knock on the suite door. Taylor ushers in Detective Clark, who looks more bad-tempered than usual. He always seems to look bad-tempered. Perhaps it’s the way his face is set. “Mr. Grey, Mrs. Grey, thank you for seeing me.” 386/551 “Detective Clark.” Christian shakes his hand and directs him to
