they are out of my way. I've seen none like Edgar." "You may see some. And he won't always be hand- some and young, and may not always be rich." "He is now; and I have only to do with the present. I wish you would speak rationally." "Well, that settles it. If you have only to do with the present, marry Mr. Linton." "I don't want your permission for that---I shall marry him; and yet you have not told me whether I'm right." "Perfectly right, if people be right to marry only for the present. And now, let us hear what you are unhappy about. Your brother will be pleased; the old lady and gentleman will not object, I think; you will escape from a disorderly, comfortless home into a wealthy, respecta- ble one; and you love Edgar, and Edgar loves you. All seems smooth and easy. Where is the obstacle?" "Here, and here!" replied Catherine, striking one hand on her forehead and the other on her breast; "in whichever place the soul lives. In my soul and in my heart I'm convinced I'm wrong." "That's very strange. I cannot make it out." "It's my secret. But if you will not mock at me, I'll explain it.

"We're dismal enough without conjuring up ghosts and visions to per- plex us. Come, come, be merry and like yourself! Look at little Hareton! He's dreaming nothing dreary. How sweetly he smiles in his sleep!" "Yes; and how sweetly his father curses in his soli- tude! You remember him, I dare say, when he was just such another as that chubby thing---nearly as young and innocent. However, Nelly, I shall oblige you to listen; it's not long, and I've no power to be merry to- night." "I won't hear it, I won't hear it!" I repeated hastily. I was superstitious about dreams then, and am still; and Catherine had an unusual gloom in her aspect that made me dread something from which I might shape a prophecy and foresee a fearful catastrophe. She was vexed, but she did not proceed. Apparently taking up another subject, she recommenced in a short time. "If I were in heaven, Nelly, I should be extremely miserable." "Because you are not fit to go there," I answered. "All sinners would be miserable in heaven." "But it is not for that. I dreamt
