deep blue eyes were swimming with tears as she drew his head slowly towards her and kissed him gently on the lips. Then she let him go and turned off the light 'Good night, my dearest love,' she said. Bond bent and kissed her. He tasted the tears on her heck. He went to the door and looked back. 'Sleep well, my darling,' he said. 'Don't worry, everything's all right now.' He closed the door softly and walked to his room with a full heart. CHAPTER 27 - THE BLEEDING HEART The patron brought him the letter in the morning. He burst into Bond's room holding the envelope in front of him as if it was on fire. 'There has been a terrible accident. Madame . . .' Bond hurled himself out of bed and through the bathroom, but the communicating door was locked. He dashed back and through his room and down the corridor past a shrinking, terrified maid. Vesper's door was open. The sunlight through the shutters lit up the room. Only her black hair showed above the sheet and her body under the bedclothes was straight and moulded like a stone effigy on a tomb. Bond fell on his knees beside her and drew back the sheet.

He sat on the edge of his bed and gazed out of the window at the peaceful sea. Then he stared dully at the envelope. It was addressed simply in a large round hand 'Pour Lui'. The thought passed through Bond's mind that she must have left orders to be called early, so that it would not be he who found her. He turned the envelope over. Not long ago it was her warm tongue which had sealed the flap. He gave a sudden shrug and opened it. It was not long. After the first few words he read it quickly, the breath coming harshly through his nostrils. Then he threw it down on the bed as if it had been a scorpion. MY DARLING JAMES [the letter opened], I love you with all my heart and while you read
