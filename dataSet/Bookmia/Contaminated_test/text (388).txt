on the table. He never misses a 119/551 beat as he takes me, again and again, moving strong and hard inside me, my in- sides tightening and quivering. “Oh fuck,” I moan. This is going to rip me apart. “Yes, baby,” he hisses. “Please,” I beg him and I don’t know what for—to stop, to never stop, to twist the plug again. My insides are tightening around him and the plug. “That’s right,” he breathes, and he slaps me hard on my right buttock, and I come—again and again, falling, falling, spinning, pulsing around and around—and Christian gently pulls the plug out. “Fuck! ” I scream and Christian grabs my hips and climaxes loudly, holding me still. The woman is still singing. Christian always puts songs on repeat in here. Strange. I am curled in his arms on his lap our legs tangled together, with my head resting against his chest. We’re on the floor of the playroom by the table. “Welcome back,” he says, peeling the blindfold off me. I blink as my eyes adjust to the muted light. Tipping my chin back, he plants a soft kiss on my lips, his eyes focused on and anxiously searching mine. I reach up to caress his face. He smiles. “Well, did I fulfill the brief?” he asks, amused.

Oh my . . . did I ever have a chance of resisting this man? I reach for his left hand and plant a kiss on his wedding ring, a plain platinum band matching my own. “Mine,” I whisper. “Yours,” he responds. He curls his arms around me and presses his nose into my hair. “Shall I run you a bath?” “Hmm. Only if you join me in it.” “Okay,” he says. He sets me onto my feet and stands up beside me. He’s still wearing his jeans. “Will you wear your . . . er . . . other jeans?” He
