Santa has been here. Santa does not know I have been bad. I am glad Santa does not know. I have a train and a plane and a helicopter and a car and a helicopter. My helicopter can fly. My helicopter is blue. It flies around the Christmas tree. It flies over the piano and lands in the middle of the white. It flies over Mommy and flies over Daddy and flies over Lelliot as he plays with the Lego. The helicopter flies through the house, through the dining room, through the kitchen. He flies past the door to Daddy’s study and upstairs in my bedroom, in Lelliot’s bedroom, Mommy and Daddy’s bedroom. He flies through the house, because it’s my house. My house where I live. Monday, May 9, 2011 “Tomorrow,” I mutter, dismissing Claude Bastille as he stands on the threshold of my office. “Golf, this week, Grey.” Bastille grins with easy arrogance, knowing that his victory on the golf course is assured. 530/551 I scowl after him as he turns and leaves.

I shouldn’t feel this way, not after several bouts with Bastille. But I do. I frown. The sobering truth is that the only thing to capture my interest re- cently has been my decision to send two freighters of cargo to Sudan. This re- minds me—Ros is supposed to come back to me with numbers and logistics. What the hell is keeping her? Intent on finding out what she’s playing at, I glance at my schedule and reach for the phone. Oh, Christ! I have to endure an interview with the persistent Miss Kavanagh for the WSU student magazine. Why the fuck did I agree to this? I loathe interviews—inane questions from inane, ill-informed, vacuous idiots. The phone buzzes. “Yes,” I snap at Andrea as if she’s to blame. At least I can keep this interview short. “Miss Anastasia Steele is here to see you, Mr. Grey.” “Steele? I was expecting Katherine Kavanagh.” “It’s Miss Anastasia Steele who’s here, sir.” I scowl. I hate the unexpected. “Show her in,” I mutter, aware that I sound like a sulky teen but not giving a fuck. Well, well . . . Miss Kavanagh is unavailable. I
