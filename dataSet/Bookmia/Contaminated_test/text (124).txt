'tis in an hour like this, with soul beat down and held to knowledge, --as wild, untutored things are forced to feed --Oh, life! 'tis now that I do feel the latent horror in thee! but 'tis not me! that horror's out of me! and with the soft feeling of the human in me, yet will I try to fight ye, ye grim, phantom futures! Stand by me, hold me, bind me, O ye blessed influences! .. <p 168 > .. < chapter xxxix 2 FIRST NIGHT-WATCH FORE-TOP > ( Stubb solus, and mending a brace.)
