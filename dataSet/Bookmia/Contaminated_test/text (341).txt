from the subway with the money in his pocket (he had visited the bank which was open all night and every night with robot tellers in attendance) and as he walked he was listening to the Seashell radio in one car... "We have mobilized a million men. Quick victory is ours if the war comes .. .." Music flooded over the voice quickly and it was gone. "Ten million men mobilized," Faber's voice whispered in his other ear. "But say one million. It's happier." "Faber?" "Yes?" "I'm not thinking. I'm just doing like I'm told, like always. You said get the money and I got it. I didn't really think of it myself. When do I start working things out on my own?" "You've started already, by saying what you just said. You'll have to take me on faith." "I took the others on faith ! " "Yes, and look where we're headed. You'll have to travel blind for a while. Here's my arm to hold on to."

Montag found himself at the parlour door with his food still in his mouth. "Doesn't everyone look nice!" "Nice." "You look fine, Millie! " "Fine." "Everyone looks swell." "Swell! "Montag stood watching them. "Patience," whispered Faber. "I shouldn't be here," whispered Montag, almost to himself. "I should be on my way back to you with the money!" "Tomorrow's time enough. Careful!" "Isn't this show wonderful?" cried Mildred. "Wonderful!" On one wall a woman smiled and drank orange juice simultaneously. How does she do both at once, thought Montag, insanely. In the other walls an X-ray of the same woman revealed the contracting journey of the refreshing beverage on its way to her delightful stomach! Abruptly the room took off on a rocket flight into the clouds, it
