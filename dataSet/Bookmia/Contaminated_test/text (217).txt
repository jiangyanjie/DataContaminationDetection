refrain from insult as much as you are able. Having levelled my palace, don't erect a hovel and complacently admire your own charity in giving me that for a home. lf I imag- ined you really wished me to marry Isabel, I'd cut my throat!" "Oh, the evil is that I am not jealous, is it?" cried Catherine. "Well, I won't repeat my offer of a wife. It is as bad as offering Satan a lost soul. Your bliss lies, like his, in inflicting misery. You prove it. Edgar is re- stored from the ill-temper he gave way to at your com- ing. I begin to be secure and tranquil; and you, restless to know us at peace, appear resolved on exciting a quar- rel. Quarrel with Edgar, if you please, Heathcliff, and deceive his sister. You'll hit on exactly the most effi- cient method of revenging yourself on me." The conversation ceased. Mrs. Linton sat down by the fire, flushed and gloomy. The spirit which served her was growing intractable; she could neither lay nor control it. He stood on the hearth with folded arms, brooding on his evil thoughts; and in this position I left them to seek the master, who was wondering what kept Catherine below so long.

I fancied it could not be very prejudicial to Mrs. Linton, unless she made it so afterwards by assuming the de- fensive for her guest. Edgar Linton had difficulty in hearing me to the close. His first words revealed that he did not clear his wife of blame. "This is insufferable!" he exclaimed. "It is disgrace- ful that she should own him for a friend, and force his company on me! Call me two men out of the hall, Ellen. Catherine shall linger no longer to argue with the low ruffian. I have humoured her enough." He descended, and bidding the servants wait in the passage, went, followed by me, to the kitchen. Its oc- cupants had recommenced their angry discussion. Mrs. Linton, at least, was scolding with renewed vigour. Heathcliff had moved to the window, and hung his head, somewhat cowed by her violent rating apparently. He saw the master first, and made a hasty motion that she should be silent; which she obeyed abruptly, on dis- covering the reason of his intimation. "How is this?" said Linton, addressing her. "What notion of propriety must you have to remain here, after the language which has been held to you by that black- guard? I suppose, because it is his ordinary talk, you think nothing of it. You are habituated to his baseness, and, perhaps, imagine I can get
