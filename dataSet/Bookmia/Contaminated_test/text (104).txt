this afternoon. “You feel railroaded?” he whispers. I nod. He closes his eyes and runs his hand through his hair in agitation. “I just want to give you the world, Ana, everything and anything you want. And save you from it, too. Keep you safe. But I also want everyone to know you’re mine. I pan- icked today when I got your e-mail. Why didn’t you tell me about your name?” I flush. He has a point. “I only thought about it while we were on our honeymoon, and well, I didn’t want to burst the bubble, and I forgot about it. I only remembered yesterday even- ing. And then Jack . . . you know, it was distracting. I’m sorry, I should have told you or discussed it with you, but I could never seem to find the right time.” Christian’s intense gaze is unnerving. It’s as if he’s trying to will his way into my skull, but he says nothing. “Why did you panic?” I ask. 165/551 “I just don’t want you to slip through my fingers.” “For heaven’s sake, I’m not going anywhere.

If it meant that much to you.” Oh my. “Does it mean that much to you?” “Yes.” He is unequivocal. “Okay.” I will do this for him. Give him the reassurance he still needs. “I thought you’d already agreed to this.” “Yes I have, but now we’ve discussed it further, I’m happier with my decision.” “Oh,” he mutters, surprised. Then he smiles his beautiful, boyish yes-I-am- really-kinda-young smile, and he takes my breath away. Grabbing me by my waist, he swings me around. I squeal and start to giggle, and I don’t know if he’s just happy or relieved or . . . what? “Mrs. Grey, do you know what this means to me?” “I do now.” He leans down and kisses me, his fingers moving into my hair, holding me in place. “It means seven shades of Sunday,” he murmurs against my lips, and he runs his nose along mine. “You think?” I lean back to gaze at him. 166/551 “Certain promises were made.
