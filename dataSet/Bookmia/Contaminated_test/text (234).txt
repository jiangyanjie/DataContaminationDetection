man. I never say to him, 'Let this or that enemy alone, because it would be ungener- ous or cruel to harm them.' I say, 'Let them alone, be- cause I should hate them to be wronged.' And he'd crush you like a sparrow's egg, Isabella, if he found you a troublesome charge. I know he couldn't love a Linton; and yet he'd be quite capable of marrying your fortune and expectations. Avarice is growing with him a be- setting sin. There's my picture; and I'm his friend---so much so, that had he thought seriously to catch you, I should perhaps have held my tongue, and let you fall into his trap." Miss Linton regarded her sister-in-law with indigna- tion. "For shame! for shame!" she repeated angrily; "you are worse than twenty foes, you poisonous friend!" "Ah! you won't believe me, then?" said Catherine. "You think I speak from wicked selfishness?" "I'm certain you do," retorted Isabella; "and I shud- der at you!" "Good!" cried the other. "Try for yourself, if that be your spirit. I have done, and yield the argument to your saucy insolence." "And I must suffer for her egotism!" she sobbed, as Mrs. Linton left the room. "All, all is against me. She has blighted my single consolation. But she uttered falsehoods, didn't she? Mr. Heathcliff is not a fiend.

They say Mr. Earnshaw is worse and worse since he came. They sit up all night together continually, and Hindley has been borrowing money on his land, and does nothing but play and drink. I heard only a week ago---it was Joseph who told me---I met him at Gim- merton. 'Nelly,' he said, 'we's hae a crowner's 'quest enow, at ahr folks. One on 'em's a'most getten his finger cut off wi' hauding t'other fro' stickin hisseln loike a cawlf. That's maister, yah knaw, 'at's soa up o' going tuh t' grand 'sizes. He's noan feared o' t' bench o' judges, norther Paul, nur Peter, nur John, nur Matthew, nor noan on 'em, not he. He fair likes---he langs to set his brazened face agean 'em. And yon bonny lad Heath- cliff, yah mind, he's a rare un! He can girn a laugh as well's onybody at a raight divil's jest. Does he niver say nowt of his fine living amang us, when he goes to t' Grange? This is t' way on't. Up at sundown; dice, brandy, cloised shutters, un can'le-light till next day at noon; then, t'
