hardly of you," I said; "and I'll tell you why not so much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an imposter, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I had no 'brass' and no house. Some of the best people that ever lived have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought not to consider poverty a crime."     "No more I ought," said she; "Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I wor wrong but I've clear a different notion on you now to what I had. You look a raight down decent little crater."     "That will do I forgive you now. Shake hands."     She put her floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile illumined her rough face; and from that moment we were friends.     Hannah was evidently fond of talking. While I picked the fruit, and she made the paste for the pies, she proceeded to give me sundry details about her deceased master and mistress, and "the childer," as she called the young people.     Old Mr. Rivers, she said, was a plain man enough; but a gentleman, and of as ancient a family as could be found.

She was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the "bairns" had taken after her. There was nothing like them in these parts, nor ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time they could speak; and they had always been "of a mak' of their own." Mr. St. John, when he grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as governesses; for they had told her their father had some years ago lost a great deal of money, by a man he had trusted turning bankrupt; and as he was now not rich enough to give them fortunes, they must provide for themselves. They had lived very little at home for a long while, and were only come now to stay a few weeks on account of their father's death; but they did so like Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors and hills about. They had been in London, and
