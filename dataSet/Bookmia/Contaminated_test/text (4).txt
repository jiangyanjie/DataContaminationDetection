the chief--" "--you got to go for your own good." "The chief and Roger--" "--yes, Roger--" "They hate you, Ralph. They're going to do you." "They're going to hunt you tomorrow." "But why?" "I dunno. And Ralph, Jack, the chief, says it'll be dangerous--" "--and we've got to be careful and throw our spears like at a pig." "We're going to spread out in a line across the island--" "--we're going forward from this end--" "--until we find you." "We've got to give signals like this." Eric raised his head and achieved a faint ululation by beating on his open mouth. Then he glanced behind him nervously. "Like that--" "--only louder, of course." "But I've done nothing," whispered Ralph, urgently. "I only wanted to keep up a fire!" He paused for a moment, thinking miserably of the morrow. A matter of overwhelming importance occurred to him. "What are you--?" He could not bring himself to be specific at first; but then fear and loneliness goaded him. "When they find me, what are they going to do?" The twins were silent. Beneath him, the death rock flowered again. "What are they--oh God! I'm hungry--" The towering rock seemed to sway under him. "Well--what--?" The twins answered his question indirectly. "You got to go now, Ralph." "For your own good." "Keep away. As far as you can." "Won't you come with me? Three of us--we'd stand a chance." After a moment's silence, Sam spoke in a strangled voice.

"He's coming to see if we're keeping watch. Quick, Ralph!" As he prepared to let himself down the cliff, Ralph snatched at the last possible advantage to be wrung out of this meeting. "I'll lie up close; in that thicket down there," he whispered, "so keep them away from it. They'll never think to look so close--" The footsteps were still some distance away. "Sam--I'm going to be all right, aren't I?" The twins were silent again. "Here!" said Sam suddenly. "Take this--" Ralph felt a chunk of meat pushed against him and grabbed it. "But what are you going to do when you catch me?" Silence above. He sounded silly to himself. He lowered himself down the rock. "What are you going to do--?" From the top of the towering rock came the incomprehensible reply. "Roger sharpened a stick at both ends." Roger sharpened a stick at both ends. Ralph tried to attach a meaning to this but could not. He used all the bad words he could think of in a fit of temper that passed into yawning. How long could you go without sleep? He yearned for a bed and sheets--but the only whiteness here was the slow spilt milk, luminous round the rock forty feet below, where Piggy had fallen. Piggy was everywhere, was on this neck, was become terrible in darkness and death. If Piggy were to come back now out of the water, with his
