He considered the chambers and his own lodging as temporary residences, and advised me to look out at once for a "fashionable crib' near Hyde Park, in which he could have "a shake-down'. When he had made an end of his breakfast, and was wiping his knife on his leg, I said to him, without a word of preface: "After you were gone last night, I told my friend of the struggle that the soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes, when we came up.
