past with us. And, mother mine, there's a thing you don't know and should--we are Harkonnens." Her mind did a terrifying thing: it blanked out as though it needed to shut off all sensation. But Paul's voice went on at that implacable pace, dragging her with it. "When next you find a mirror, study your face--study mine now. The traces are there if you don't blind yourself. Look at my hands, the set of my bones. And if none of this convinces you, then take my word for it. I've walked the future, I've looked at a record, I've seen a place, I have all the data. We're Harkonnens." "A . . . renegade branch of the family," she said. "That's it, isn't it? Some Harkonnen cousin who--" "You're the Baron's own daughter," he said, and watched the way she pressed her hands to her mouth. "The Baron sampled many pleasures in his youth, and once permitted himself to be seduced. But it was for the genetic purposes of the Bene Gesserit, by one of you." The way he said 'you' struck her like a slap. But it set her mind to working and she could not deny his words. So many blank ends of meaning in her past reached out now and linked. The daughter the Bene Gesserit wanted--it wasn't to end the old Atreides-Harkonnen feud, but to fix some genetic factor in their lines. What? She groped for an answer.

And that, she knew, was the basis of her fear. "You're thinking I'm the Kwisatz Haderach," he said. "Put that out of your mind. I'm something unexpected." I must get word out to one of the schools, she thought. The mating index may show what has happened. "They won't learn about me until it's too late," he said. She sought to divert him, lowered her hands and said: "We'll find a place among the Fremen?" "The Fremen have a saying they credit to Shai-hulud, Old Father Eternity," he said. "They say: 'Be prepared to appreciate what you meet.' " And he thought: Yes, mother mine--among the Fremen. You'll acquire the blue eyes and a callus beside your lovely nose from the filter tube to your stillsuit . . . and you'll bear my sister: St. Alia of the Knife. "If you're not the Kwisatz Haderach," Jessica said, "what--" "You couldn't possibly know," he said. "You won't believe it until you see it." And he thought: I'm a seed. He suddenly saw how fertile was the ground into which he had fallen, and with this realization, the terrible purpose filled him, creeping through the empty place within, threatening to choke him with grief.
