My children have had other birth-places, and, so far as their fortunes may be within my control, shall strike their roots into accustomed earth.% On emerging from the Old Manse, it was chiefly this strange, indolent, unjoyous attachment for my native town that brought me to fill a place in Uncle Sam's brick edifice, when I might as well, or better, have gone somewhere else.
