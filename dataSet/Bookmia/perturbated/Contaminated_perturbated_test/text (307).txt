her distressed and talking to the director about the project, but she stopped laughing on the phone. Then, talking up, he had called to Collet and demanded he get Agent Neveu on the line. Now Collet had failed, and Fache looked like a caged lion. "Do they give him a Crypto call?" Fache ventured. Fache turned. "For us they found no references to mad and lame saints." "That's all?" "No, also to confirm that someone had just identified the numbers as Fibonacci numbers, but then the series was meaningless." Collet was angry. "Well, they already sent Agent Neveu to the office, and I knew that." Fache shook his head. "They didn't send Neveu." "When I called to the director, at my orders he paged his entire team to look at the images of him. When Agent Neveu got over she took one of the photos of Saunire and the code and left the office without a word. The director said he didn't question her behavior because she was understandably upset by the photos." "Upset? She's never seen a picture of a dead body?" Fache was silent a moment. "I was aware of this, and it seems neither was going to know what's in the pictures." "She was angry about this until a coworker informed him, but nothing is told about that." "My scathing suggestion was that Collet was angry." "The director said she had only mentioned Saunire to him, and he assumed it was because she probably didn't want preferential treatment for having a famous grandfather." No one was told that the director failed to get one of the photos that called in a young woman to decipher a code written by a family member. Still, her actions made him mad. "But she probably recognized the numbers as Fibonacci numbers because she came home and told us. I don't know how she came to the office without telling anyone she wanted to sort it out." Col . I can think of only one scenario to explain the reason why Saunire had written a numeric code on the floor . In other words, the Fache would involve cryptographers in the investigation, and also his own granddaughter. As for the rest of the message, was Saunire communicating in some way with Langdon? If so, did the message tell her? And how did he come in? Before Collet could ponder it , the silence of the flag was shattered by an incident. And the bell sounded like it was in inside the Grand Gallery. "Alarme!" one of the employees yelled, eyeing his feed in the Louvre security center. "Grande Galerie! Toilettes !" one of the employees wheeled a window. "Where's Langdon?" "Still in the men's room!" he he had pointed to the blinking light on his laptop schematic. "He must have broken the fire codes." But the agents knew Langdon wouldn't get far. Although Paris fire codes required that a tower of fifteen meters in public buildings be breakable , breaking the codes of fire, a second-story window without the help of a hook and ladder would be impossible. Furthermore, there were no trees or ice in the room in the room. How many fire codes of fire were set at the 57 western end of the Denon Wing to
