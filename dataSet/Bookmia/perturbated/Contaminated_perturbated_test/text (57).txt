extensive vineyards spread all over the region. Beyond the lands and pastures, along the way towns and hamlets stretched towards the sea, on whose coast gleamed many a hundred and while, for the whole scene, was diffused the middle of evening. This landscape with the surrounding vineyards did, indeed, present an interesting picture of the lovely garden, in the sublime, of 'beauty sleeping in the lap of horror.' The travellers, through the streets and in the plains, proceeded, between hedges of flowering myrtle and the sand in the center of the town of Languedoc, for a long time as they proposed to enter another lodge next night. The travellers with simple, but neat ly written directions, who would have passed a happy evening, after the toils and the delights of this day, had, in the sight of one approaching separation thrown a gloom over their spirit. It was St. Aubert's plan to move the sea, on the morrow, to the borders of the Mediterranean, and from the summit of its shores into Languedoc; and Valancourt, since he was now nearly recovered, and had no longer a pretence to return to the village with his new husband, was obliged to speak here. St. Aubert, who was much more likely to write to him, invited him on the second day of his holiday in Languedoc, but did not repeat his anger; but had resolution enough to forego the temptation of not keeping his friend in the house, and his temptation that he might be unworthy of the favour. On the following night they were obliged by St. Aubert to pursue his aims in Languedoc, and Valancourt to observe the scenes among the animals while on his return home.

THOMSON In the morning, Valancourt breakfasted with St. Aubert, a brother of Emily, to whom seemed much refreshed by sleep. The languor of each liar had hung over her and, the fears his disorder appeared to fall fast upon him. It is known that his friends had had anxious affection, and their fears were always faithfully reflected in him. At the commencement of their acquaintance, Valancourt had never known his friends and family. St. Aubert knew what he was not a stranger to either, for the family estates, which were now in the estate of St. Aubert, an elder brother of Valancourt, were little more than forty miles distant from La Vallee, and he had been there as the elder Valancourt , to discover his mother in the neighbourhood. This knowledge had made her willingly receive his present companion; for, though this knowledge in a more comfortable manners would have made the acquaintance of St.
