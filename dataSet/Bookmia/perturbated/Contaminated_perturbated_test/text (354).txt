felt happy in his success, for he knew it was the best trip for the night. At the end of the twelve or so days, the wheels stopped, and Tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers. He flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly spotted himself at the back fence. He climbed on the "ell," and looked in at the sitting-room , and a light was shining on him. There , Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper's mother, grouped together, and the stairs were by the bed, but the bed was between them and the door. Tom went to bed and began to softly lift the latch; then stepped gently and the door yielded . However, he continued pushing cautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, and judged by the door and his squeeze through on his knees; so he opened his hand, and saw it the last night. "What makes the candle "" said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried up. "Why, that door's open, I believe. Of course it is. No end of strange things now. Go 'long and shut ". Tom looked through the door and open the door in his chest, his leg was lay and looked for a moment, then crept as though he could find his aunt's foot. --------------------------------------------------------- -155- "But as I was saying," said Mary, "he warn't bad, so to speak, I am telling." Only an ooy-yya and harum-scarum, you know. He warn't any more than he is a colt. He never meant a person to giddy, and he was the best-hearted man he ever was" -- and she apologies for his cry. "I, of course, do just so with my Joe -- always full of his devilment, and up to every kind of mischief, but he looked as unselfish , as he could have been! Let freedom and laws bless me, to think I went to forgive him for taking that cream, never once again! I throwed it out myself because his cream was not sour, but never to re it again in this world, never, never, never, poor ! And Mrs. Sid was looking as if her heart would break. "I hope Tom's will be where he is," said Sid, "but we've been going forward in some ways -- " "Sid !" Tom felt the glare of the old lady's eyes that he could not be it. "Not far against my Tom, now that he's really the God I 've found -- if you need to take care of him , maybe you trouble him." Oh, and I don't know how to give him up! I don't know how to give him up! He was the most comfort to me, although he tormented my old heart out -- "The name of the Lord and the Lord hath taken away -- Blessed be the name of the King." But it's always nice and nice -- Oh, I know, how hard! Only last Saturday my Joe busted a firecracker right under my nose and found him sprawling. Little did I know then, --------------------------------------------------------- -156- how soon --
