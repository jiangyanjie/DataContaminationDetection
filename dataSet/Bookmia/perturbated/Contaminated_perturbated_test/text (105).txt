"Go and burn your mothers' genitals," said one of the priests. The men were seized and killed. The men came in and they streamed with blood. After that nothing happened for a long time between the church and the clan. But stories were already gaining ground in the same church: A white man had not committed to a church or an government. It was said that they had built a place of judgment and hope to protect the followers of their family. In some cases, the church even said that they had hanged one man who killed a missionary. Although such stories were now often told they looked like fairytales in Mbanta and did not yet affect the relationship between the new church and the clan. There was no question that a white man, Mr. Kiaga, with its violent madness, was quite harmless. Like his converts, no one could kill a missionary after having killed him from the clan, for any reason. But their worthlessness of all these people belonged to the clan. And they gave serious attention to the stories about a white man's government or the consequences of killing them. If they were to be more troublesome than they already were they would simply be driven out of the clan. And the church was at the same time too deeply ashamed of its position as an authority to open the clan. It all covered the question of admitting outcasts. These outcasts, or osu, seeing that the new religion and the clan were ignoring the news and such abominations, thought that these messages would also be received. On one Sunday two of them went into the church. There was an immediate stir, but so great was the work that the church had done among the converts that they did not immediately leave the congregation . Now those outcasts came in. Those who found themselves nearest to them had just moved to another seat. It was a huge rage, but it only lasted till the end of the service. The church raised a protest and was only ready to turn these people out, when Mr. Kiaga stopped them and asked them to explain. "Before God," he said, "there would be no free of power and no free . We are all children of God and we receive these our brothers." "You do not understand," said one of the converts. "What will the peoples hold in front of us when they hear that we receive osu into our midst? They will laugh." "Let them laugh," said Kiaga. When will they laugh at them on the first day of the day? Why do the nations rage and the peoples imagine a great situation? He that was in the heavens shall laugh. The Lord shall explain the matter of yourselves. You do not know about that matter." Kiaga and the convert maintained. "You are not your father and you teach us the things of our faith. It is a matter which we must be given in our lives." And the convert asked him what an osu was. He was a person dedicated to a good thing and it is a matter which is more important than teaching us his children after him. He could neither marry nor be married by the end of the day. But that was
