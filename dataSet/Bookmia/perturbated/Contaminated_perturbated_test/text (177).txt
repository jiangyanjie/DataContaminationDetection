weak. Tarzan had to lift it on the front of him so that people could know the gourd. The fever had not been the result of infection, as D'Arnot had thought, but one of those that commonly attack whites in the middle of Africa, and either kill or kill them. And the first question: Are they as young as D'Arnot's had ? Two days later, D'Arnot was tottering about Tarzan, and Tarzan's strong arm about him to keep him calm. They sat beneath the shade of the tree, and found some interracial differences so that they might converse. And the first message: What can I do to repay you for all that you have done for me? And the second reply: Teach me to speak the words of men. And so Tarzan taught himself all the English at once, pointing out familiar objects and their names in French, for he thought that it would be easier to teach this as his own language, since he understood it himself best of all. But that added nothing to Tarzan, of course, for he knew one would distinguish one language from another, so when he spoke to the word man which he had printed upon a piece of paper, he learned from D'Arnot that it was pronounced HOMME, and in the other hand, he was able to pronounce ape, SINGE and DONTX.

It had been hard for him to remain a Frenchman all these days , for this very reason, and that he had unselfishly done much more to his nobility of character than even the fact that he was rescuing the French man from the Mbonga's clan. Tarzan, who was willing to assist at the journey, wrote: But you cannot carry me in that direction... this tangled up will not fail," Tarzan laughed. "MAIS I - D'Arnot appeared to hear the phrase that he used so often glide from Tarzan's tongue. As Tarzan set out, D'Arnot marveling as had Clayton and Jane at the wondrous strength and agility of the apeman. Mid-afternoon brought them to the clearing, and the apeman got a chance to encounter Jane Tarzan
