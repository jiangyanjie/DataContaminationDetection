the place where I had pants and gloves for sale. It was dark, and I had the devil of a hunt after matches, which I found floating in the drawer of the little thing. Then I managed to get a candle. I had to tear down wrappings and ransack a number of shelves and drawers, and then I managed to get the clothing I sought; the box label called them lambswool pants, and lambswool vests. Then it was a big job. It had become an art, and then I went to the clothing place and got trousers, a lounge jacket, an overcoat and a slouch hat --a clerical sort of hat . To my brim turned down. I began to feel a human being again, and my next thought was food. In a refreshment time there I got coffee. There was still in the cupboard, and I lit the lid.
