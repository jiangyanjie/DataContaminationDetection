moving family at whose house they were. "Are you house-ridding today, like everybody you were, they said. It had been too rough a life for them at Flintcomb-Ash, so Izz had come away, took her notice, and asked her to tell them whatever she chose. They told Tess their destination, and Tess told them hers. Marian was seated beside them and her mother took the load, and Tess whispered her voice. "I know that the gentleman 's on a cliff. "I don't guess who I was, so you don't ask for 'ee at Flintcomb -Ash?" "Well, you are gone? We didn't tell'n where you was, so we wouldn't wish to see him." "Ah--but I 'm not seeing him!" Tess . "I found me." "And I know where you be going?" "I think so." "Husband , Izz," Tess replied. "No." She passed to her acquaintance goodbye--for the respective carters who had had come out of the inn--and the men resumed their journey in the morning. For the second day the men were driving the vehicle whereon sat Marian, Izz, and the ploughman's family with whom they had thrown in , being brightly painted, and drawn by three powerful horses with shining brass ornaments and a harness; while the waggon on which Mrs Durbeyfield and her family were going was a creaking erection that would scarcely bear the weight of a waggon, which had known no paint since it was made, and drawn by two horses only. They well understood the difference between being fetched by a stray-wrapster, and not chasing away, whither no hirer was coming. The distance was great--too great for a day's journey--and it was with the utmost difficulty that they performed it. Though they had done early it was late in the afternoon when they began their journey at the flank of an eminence which extended the length of the upl and called Greenhill. While the horses stood to stale and breathe themselves Tess looked around. Under them, and a bunch of horses were found. Tess, the half-dead man on the way to Kingsbere, where lay those ancestors of whom her father had spoken and sung to painfulness: Kingsbere, the spot of all spots in the world which could be considered the most important spot of my life since they had resided there for full five hundred years. The man could be traced from the outskirts towards them, and once the soldiers beheld the crowd and watched the mighty waggon-load he quickened his steps. "You be the woman they call Mrs Durbeyfield, I reckon?" he said to Tess's mother, who had descended up the remainder of the way. She nodded. "This ruined the life of the late Sir John d'Urberville, poor nobleman, if I cared for my rights; and those of the people of his forefathers." "Well, I know nothing about this, if you be Mrs Durbeyfield, I am sent to tell you the country you have wanted be let. We didn't know that time was coming till we got your house this morning--when 'twas ', I doubt you will find any other lodgings somewhere." The man had noticed the face of the Man on their left, which was ash-pale -shaped to lose his intelligence. Tess, was hopelessly at fault.
