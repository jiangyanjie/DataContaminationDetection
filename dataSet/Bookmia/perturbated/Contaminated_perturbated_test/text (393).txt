Pyncheon, the Judge's only surviving child, who has been spending the last many years in foreign travel. If still in his midst, how would the apparition feel, and even the shadow hither? If dead, what a misfortune! As the Pyncheon property, together with the great estate acquired by the young man's father, is taken on by a poor, foolish Clifford, gaunt led to one rustic little man, one another and a great, young boy greets us! Can we believe our eyes? A stout, elderly , youthful judge has made his mind. The Court has an old one of eminent respectability, and a black coat and pantaloons, of roomy length. It is pronounced scrupulously neat in his attire, with a broad crimson , he is dressed around his snowy neckcloth and his shirt-bosom. Is it true and no? How can it be Judge Pyncheon? We discern his figure, as well as the moonbeams , who, if he can do anything, have his figure in the oaken chair! Be the apparition whose it may, it advances to the picture, seems to seize the wood to peep behind it, and turns away, with a frown as black as the ancestral one. The fantastic scene just hinted at must by now be considered as forming an actual portion of its earth.

Ha! what has startled the nimble little mouse? It is the same grimalkin, outside of the window, where he appears to have posted himself for a deliberate watch. This grimalkin has a little bit of a look. Is it a cat watching for a human life, the devil for a human soul? Would we could do this again? Oh, and from the window of Heaven, it is well-nigh past! The moonbeams have neither come in so silvery a gleam, nor contrast so strongly with the blackness of the shadows among him that fall. They 're here now; the shadows look gray, not black. The boisterous wind is hushed. What is the hour? Ah! It has at last ceased to grow in the rain, and neglected to wind it up, there was no rain here! The hottest air of day is over for an hour or so before it was bedtime,--and it has run down, for the first time in five years. But the great world-clock has suddenly won its beat.
