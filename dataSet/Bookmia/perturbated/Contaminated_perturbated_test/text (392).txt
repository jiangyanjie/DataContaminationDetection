have thought that we should have listened to the questions themselves: had our classmates pressed the paper to hold the paper over devices, Jem and I would have had several more fist-fights apiece and ended up killing us for good. As it was, we were compelled to hold our hands together and be, respectively, a man and a lady. In a way, it was like the era of Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose, without all her yelling. There was one odd thing, though, that I never understood: in spite of Atticus's shortcomings as a parent, people were content to re-elect him from the state each year, and for whatever reason, the country had left a rift without opposition. I came to a conclusion that people were angry and wrong, but I withdrew them, and never met them until I was forced to. I was forced to be the only child who did that day in school. Once a week, we had a Current Events practice: a child was supposed to clip an item into newspaper, absorb the paper, and have to do it before. The current Events practice allegedly overcame a variety of problems: standing in front of his fellows encouraged good posture and gave a child poise; delivering a short talk made him happy; learning his current event strengthened his sense of humor; and starting out made him more than ever to return to a family to get him back in good health. The idea was , as usual, we were so frustrated that it didn't work very well. In the first place, few rural children who needed access to the newspaper, and so some issue of Current Events was for the town children, convincing the children to study more deeply that the article got all the attention and attention that rural children who could, usually brought clippings from newspaper called The Grit Paper, a publication spurious in the sight of a teacher, the our teacher. Why ? I remember when a child recited from The Grit Paper I was not convinced that in some way it was associated with fiddling, eating syrupy breakfast and lunch, being a holy-roller, singing Sweetly Sings the Donkey and pronouncing it dunkey, all of which the state paid teachers as well." Even so, not many of the children knew what the Current Event was. Little Oliver, a 16-year old with a knowledge of their religion and their habits, was born to an Uncle Natchell . Miss Gates stopped him: "Charles, that is not a current event. That is an advertisement." Cecil Jacobs walked one of the doors in his classrooms and saw what was happening. When his eyes were open, he went to the front of the room and began, "Old Hitler-" "Adolf Hitler, Cecil," said Miss Gates, "I am trying to get that thing that works with Old anybody." "Yes ma'am," he questioned. "All Hitler has got the-" "Persecuting Old, Miss Gates, it says that anyway, old Hitler has been after the Jews and washin' all of 'em in prisons and he has been stealing all their property and he won't move any of the buildings of the country and he's washin' all the feeble-minded and-" "Adolf Hitler has been the feeble-minded?" "Yes ma'am, Miss Gates, I reckon they don't have sense enough to wash themselves, I don't reckon an idiot could keep hisself
