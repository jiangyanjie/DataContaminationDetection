help, but in time I picked up one of them, one of which is still burning, and got some coffee ready for them. In good time they too looked really strong and well, but admitted to the morning air at nine and looked at the tide , still flowing towards us. "When it turns at nine , Herbert, come out for us, and stand right over there at Mill Pond Bank!" Chapter 54 It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the sun has to be cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade. I wore out pea-coats with one one of them and took them everywhere, and I bought a large bag of food in a bag. Of all my purchases I took no more than the few necessaries that filled the bag. Where I might go, what I might do, or when I might return, were questions utterly unknown to me; nor did they vex my mind with them, even though I was wholly set on Provis's sleigh. I only wondered for the passing moment, as I stopped at the door and said to myself, when I felt the storm was back, under what altered circumstances I should next go to other rooms, if ever. We headed the boat down to the Temple stairs, and started to be down there, as if we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all. As we arrived the next day to the toilet and the weather was still there, I didn't care why the boat should be ready and everything in our way. There was a little show of indecision, there were none to see but the old three . The belonging s to Temple stairs, we went on board , heading off; Herbert in the boat steering. It was then half-past eight - half-past eight. Then it was this. The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and being with us until three, began to creep in as it turns to us, and row against it . We should then be well in those waters , near the beaches of Kent , where the river is inflowing and solitary, and at the back of the road the waterside is very <extra_id_27> where lone public-houses are scattered here and there, so we could choose one for our first steamer! There, we meant to be all night. The steamer for Hamburg, or the first steamer for Rotterdam, would start out at about nine on Thursday s that we should know at what time we were here, and then we would meet them, and where we were, and would hail the first; so that if by any accident we were born abroad, we could have another chance. We knew the distinguishing marks of each other! The relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose, was so great to me that I found it difficult to predict the condition in which we have been a few years later. The acclaim from the eddy bear, the movement on the river, and the forest itself - the road that ran with us, seeming to sympathize with us, and me, and encourage us on - as I started with new experience and we felt mortified to be of
