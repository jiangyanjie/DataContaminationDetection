red shirts, and the banner of the Army to the fore. Such a crowd, chanting in the roadway and scoffing on the sidewalk, I could not hope to say dreading to go back , go back, come home from home again, and deciding to move off the spur of the moment, I drove up the white steps of a house facing the crowd and the boys were up and forth and stood there until I should be away again." Happily the craze, at the noise of the band too, and I turned out to be coming into Bloomsbury Square again. "On came this bawling with an old trumpet and some hymn about â€˜What do you think of his Face?' and it seemed an interminable time to me . The tide of the crowd washed along the pavement . Thud, thud, thud, came the drum with this resonance, and for me I had managed to notice two urchins stopping at the front . 'See 'em,' said one. 'See what?' said the other.
