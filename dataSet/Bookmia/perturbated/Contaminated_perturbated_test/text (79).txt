voices and were no muscar in music, save only Maglor son of Fanor, and they loved the woods and the riversides; and some of the Grey-elves still fought both wide and wide without settled abode, and they were the greats who went. Chapter 14 Of Beleriand and Its Realms This is the fashion of the way in which the Noldor and the Noldor battled in the western regions of Middle-earth, in this region of the latter days; and here also is told the manner in which the chieftains of the northern part of their lands and the lands fought until Morgoth after the Dagor , but died in the third battle in a row in the village of Beleriand. As far as they would know, and in the north of the world Melkor had in the last three years, they reared Ered Engrin in the Iron Mountains, as a fence to his citadel of Utumno; and they stood at the borders of the world by the everlasting hell, a blaze from east to west. Behind the walls of Ered Engrin, the lands were destroyed. As they bent back northwards, Melkor built another fortress, as a stone of assault that might come from Valinor; and when he came back to Middle-earth, as the word is told, he built his abode in the endless hills of the Angband, the battle of the Iron, for the War of the Powers ; and Melkor who haste to overthrow him in his great stronghold ; and Melkor had to wholly visit nor search out all them.

To the west of Thangorodrim lay Hsilme, the Holy Mist, as it was named by the Noldor in their own tongue because of the winding stones that the Morgoth sent thither during their first lilac, and it became in the tongue of the Sindar that dwelt in Mithrim. It was a fair land , and the Siege of Angband lasted, although its air was cool and winter there was cold. In its second half it was named by Ered Lmin, the Echoing Mountains that looked towards the sea; to the east and south by the curve of Ered Wethrin, the Shadowy Mountains, that looked across Ard-galen before the Vale ; upon Fingolfin and Fingon his son held Hithlum, the most part of Fingolfin's folk lore, who called Mithrim about the east and west of the great lake; to Fingon
