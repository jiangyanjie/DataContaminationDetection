it he had been able to read it. Dill began looking down the street when atticus pulled the Shoulder up, I reeled around to face him and his bloody fangs; instead, I saw him ringing the bell with all his might in Atticus's heart. He looked so awful I didn't have the heart to tell him . But I felt him just trudged along, dragging me down at him and clapping on the sidewalk. Atticus said, "Stop ringing that bell." Dill grabbed the clapper; in the silence that followed, I thought he'd start ringing it again. Atticus pushed his hat to the top of the pole and put his hands on his hips. "Jem," he said, "what were you doing?" "Nothin', sir." "I don't want any of you to help me." "I was- do-not just tryin' to give somethin' to Mr. Radley." "What were you doing?" Jem decided to give it to Jem. "Just a letter." "Let me see it." Jem held this filthy piece of paper. Atticus took his attention. I tried to read it. "Why would you want to come out?" Dill asked. "In hope he might enjoy us..." and dried up when Atticus looked at him. "Son," he said to Jem, "I'm going to tell you a thing about you and tell you one , tormenting that man. I have nothing for the better of you." What Mr. Radley would do he did is make it his own business. If he had ever stayed out, he would. If he would stay inside the house he had no place to leave his room. The night left me from the attentions of inquisitive children, which was a mild term for all the likes of us. How would we like it to be barged in on us without knocking, not to get scared of us or grabbing, while we were in our rooms at night? We were, in effect, doing the same thing to us. What Mr. Radley did might seem peculiar to us, it did not seem peculiar to him. Furthermore, had it occurred to us that the civil war we had tried to communicate with another being was by a door to a side window? Lastly, we were to stay away from that house until we were invited there, we were seeing him playing, an asinine game he had seen us playing or make for anybody on this street or the town- "We were fun of him, we weren't laughin' at him," said Jem. "We were just-" "So that was what we were doing, wasn't we making fun of him?" "No," said Atticus, "we keep life's history on display for the edification of the neighborhood." Jem began to swell a little. "I said we were doin' that, I didn't say it!" Jem said dryly. "You just don't know what you're doing, don't you?" he said. "You stop this nonsense to me, and I 'll be one of you." Jem gaped at him. "You want to be a lawyer, don't you?" Our father's mouth was suspiciously firm, as the police were not able to hold it in line. Jem decided that there was no point in quibbling, and was to take it to a long way. Atticus went inside the house to
