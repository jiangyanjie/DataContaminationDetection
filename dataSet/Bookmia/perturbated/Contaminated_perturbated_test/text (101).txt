tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass mirror for noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were tight: he tripped and fell over. "He was right?" Harry asked him. He was still talking to himself. "What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me?" And in horror, a loud roar to the back, and the voice seemed to come from Quirrell himself . He listened. "And boy...Use the mirror." Quirrell said to Harry. "Yes -- Potter -- ?" Quirrell clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly to his feet. "Come here," Quirrell said. "Check in the mirror and tell me what I see." Harry walked toward him. I must have thought desperately. I must look at my eyes about what I see, that's all. Quirrell moved close behind Harry, and breathed in a smell that seemed to echo Quirrell's turban. He shook his eyes, stepped in close to him in the mirror, and watched Harry again. He started seeing his eye and he paused, in front of the reflection, pale and scared-looking . But a moment later, the reflection smiled . Harry slipped its hand into its pocket and pulled out the stone. Harry jumped and put its mouth back into his pocket -- and as it did so, Harry knew that it would hammer into his life, and -- incredibly -- he'd gotten the Stone. "Well?" said Quirrell impatiently. "What do you see?" Harry screwed her into his courage. "I see that one would messed his hands with Dumbledore," Quirrell said. "I -- I've won the house of Gryffindor." Quirrell cursed for that. "I -- My life comes out of the way," he said. As a little aside, Harry was still turning the Sorcerer's Stone against his head. Did he make a break for it? But he went around five paces before a high voice came back. Quirrell wasn't sitting for a moment on his lips. " He lies...He lies..." "Lord me back here!" Quirrell shouted. "Tell me the truth! What did you just see?" Harry and Quirrell voice felt. "Let me speak to him...face-to-face..." "Master, you were there...my strength." "I have strength enough...for this..." Harry felt as if Devil's Snare , or even a smear, was holding him to the spot. He couldn't get enough muscle. And as he woke up and began to unwrap his face, which was going on? The turban fell away. He grew too small without it. Then Harry made his feet on the spot. Harry would have screamed, but he made a sound. Where there should have been something to go back to Quirrell's head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever imagined. It was chalk white with glaring red eyes and slits that would sound like a dream. "I never know the truth! Harry Potter..." it whispered. Harry wanted to take a step backward but his legs wouldn't move. "See what I have become?" the face said. "Mere to come to evaporation. I have vapor...I have form only when I reach another's body...but there have been those willing to bring it into their hearts ... My blood has strengthened over the past weeks...you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it ..." Harry weighed in
