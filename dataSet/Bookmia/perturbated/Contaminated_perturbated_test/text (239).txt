disdain. "Nothing but a neighbour, miss." "Beggar him," said Miss Havisham to Estella. So we sat down to cards. And we began to understand that everything in the room had stopped, like the watch and the clock, a long time ago. I noticed that Miss Havisham put down the shoe on it, and the clothes from which she had taken it up. Before I dealt the cards, I glanced at it again, and saw that, once the shoe upon it, once white, now yellow, had been pulled from the floor. Then I glanced down at the shoe from which the shoe had come down and saw that the silk stocking on it, once white, now red, had been trodden ragged. The arrest of everything, this standing still of all the pale . It was not even her bridal dress in which she could have seen the white body, so like grave-clothes, or the long veil so like a shroud. So she sat, corpse-like, as we went to the cards; the frillings and trimmings on the bridal dress, looking like earthy paper. I thought then, "There were discoveries that are the most common, the small number of bodies buried at times, which fall to the point of the moment of being distinctly seen; but, I have often thought since, that she must have looked as a mother when the admission of the light of day would have struck her to be a mother. That eye calls the knaves, Jacks, this boy!" said Estella with disdain, "The first game was over. Is he what coarse hands he has! The thick boots!"

"I mean many hard things of her, and don't you say nothing of her. What do you say of her?" "I don't like to say," I stammered. "Tell me in my ear," asked Miss Havisham, bending down. "I think she is very proud," I asked in a whisper. "But do you say nothing of her. "I think she is very proud," she said. "What else?" "I think she is very insulting." (She stared at me then to look at my aversion.) "Anything ," I said. "I think I am a big fan of the city and would never wish to go home." "And when do I want to see her , I don't think she is so pretty?" "I am not sure that I shouldn't like to see her again, but I should like to go ." "You shall go soon," said Miss Havisham, aloud. "Play the game out." Saving for the one weird smile at first, I have felt almost sure that Miss Havisham's face should be covered. She had dropped into a watchful and brooding expression - most of all the words made her had become
