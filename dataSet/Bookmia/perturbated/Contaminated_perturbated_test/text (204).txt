I have been out to Streatham since I saw you and I found you last call at the time. This is a very sweet little bag and I would not have missed it for a good deal. I must not sit gossiping here, but I would have resorted to haul these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly sought after place. I could see by his words that he had been more thirst for satisfaction than his s would imply. His eyes twinkled, and there was even a layer of color upon his sallow cheeks. He went to bed and a few minutes later I saw a slam of the sack, which told me that he was off once again after his congenial hunt. I waited until he realised there was no sign that he would return, so I got out to my room. It was no uncommon for him to stay in a room for days and years.
