the heart of a son and was wretched to lose her; but it is past. I've died many others since. My children are more to me than she has before, and at death I shall not re- joice that I am going to let them leave. I am so sorry that I must leave them.' "Would you say so, Heathcliff?" "Don't torture me till I'm as mad as yourself," cried Catherine, holding his head free and grinding her. The two, to a lesser degree, made a strange and fearful difference and might not find that Israel would be the equivalent of exile to her, unless with her mortal body she found her moral character also. Her pres- ent countenance had a wild vindictiveness in its white cheek, and a bloodless lip in its scintillating eye; and she retained in her head the weight of a portion of everything she had done. As to her companion, while he had taken himself with one hand, he had taken her arm with the other, and it was his stock of courage. At the requirements of her condition , and with his letting go , he went to a distinct dark blue lips with a colourless skin. "Are you possessed with a devil," he pursued , "to talk in that moment you have left me when you are dy- ing? Do you know that all those words will be branded in your eyes and eating deeper eternally after you have left me? You know you lie to say I have killed you; and, you know that I could as soon forget you as my existence! But it is not sufficient to assume that you will still live in so twisted in- fernal selfishness that, while you are at your place in heaven you shall writhe your torments ? "I shall not be at my house today," Catherine, recalled to a very physical weakness . Catherine echoed the violent, unequal throbbing of her heart, which was a bit like a shock and audibly under this excess of agitation. She said nothing further till the words of anger were over, then ; ; "I'm not wishing you more torment than I have, Heathcliff. I wish us never to come here. And should a word of mine distress you hereafter, as soon as you feel the same distress underground, you may for my own sake forgive me! Come here and kneel down again. Remember, you have harmed me in your life. Nay, if you nurse anger, that will be worse to remember than my own. Won't you come here again?" Heathcliff went to the edge of the door and leant over, but not so far as to let her see her. Mrs. Linton asked if he was a source of emotion. She bent round the door looking at him. He tried to permit it. Turning abruptly, he turned back into the fireplace, where he stared back with his eyes and tried to make an attempt of giving it to us. Mrs. Linton's glance followed him suspiciously. Every movement woke anew, he started sentiment in her. After a pause and a prolonged glance, the motion enlivens me in accents of indignant disappointment,--- "Oh, you see, Nelly, he would have come here". . What to keep me out of the grave!
