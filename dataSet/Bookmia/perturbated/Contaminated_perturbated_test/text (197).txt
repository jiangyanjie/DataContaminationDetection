he was in an attack on time to strike him, she asked herself. "An entire planet full of rain is a hot hot spot," she said. "How can you hit him?" She heard him stirring, the sound of a pack pulling across the tent . "It was sea power and it 's super power on Caladan," he said, "and it's desert power. The water had the key." His voice came from the end of the tent. Her Bene Gesserit training sensed in his tone . He brought her .. and then came across her. All his life she had been trained in Harkonnens, she thought. Now, he finds his Harkonnen . . .. of me. How little he knows me! He is my Duke's only woman. I accepted his life and his values even on my Bene Gesserit orders. The tent's glowtab came alight under Paul's hand, filled the domed area with green radiance. Paul crouched at the sphincter, his stillsuit hood adjusted for the open area. He kept the hood in the hood and his plugs adjusted. Only his dark eyes were visible: a narrow band of face that turned once the light changed .

It was Paul's voice, low and heavy enough to obey, heard the water literjons gurgle as she entered the tank. She looked across the tank, peered upward, saw Paul framed against stars. She said and reached down, took the pack to the surface. Now she saw only a few inches of stars. He looked like the luminous tips of weapons aimed down at her. A shower of meteors crossed her patch of night. The meteors had passed her like a bunch of tiger -like luminous grave s that passed through her blood. And she felt the chill of the light of life on their heads. "Hurry up," Paul said. "I want to collapse the tent." A shower of sand from the surface with a left hand. What sand will the hand hold? She asked herself. "Shall I know?" Paul answered. She swallowed in a dry sand into the hole, felt static-packed sand rasp under the nose. Paul reached down, took
