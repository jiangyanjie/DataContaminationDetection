to the Club festivities. She, it seems, woke up suddenly in the window that comes before the dawn, with the strong impression that the rest of their bedroom had opened and closed. She did not arouse her husband , but sat up in bed listening. She then distinctly noticed one pad, pad, pad of bare feet coming out of the adjoining doorway, walking along the passage towards the staircase. As soon as she felt assured of this, she aroused the Rev. Mr. Bunting as quietly as possible. He did not strike a candle and putting him into the dark spectacles, her dressing-gown, and his bath slippers, the Rev. Mr. Bunting came out on the landing to listen. He heard quite the same thing on at his study desk , and then a violent sneeze. At the same time, she returned to her bedroom, armed with the most of the poker, and descended and stood as noiselessly as possible. His hand came out after the sun started to fade. The hour was about thirty minutes, and there was the ultimate time in the day, and the night was past. There was a faint shimmer of light in the midst of a strange opening of the room, and the room yawned impenetrably black. Everything was a little strange, the faint creaking of the stairs under Mr. Bunting's tread, and the slight movements of study.

One thing kept up Mr. Bunting's courage: the persuasion that this burglar was here in the country. They heard the robber's money, and realised that the robber had found the housekeeping reserve of thirty ten in half- sovereigns altogether. At that point Mr. Bunting was nerved to abrupt action. Gripping back firmly, he rushed into the room, closely followed by the Mrs. Bunting. "Surrender!" cried Mr. Bunting, fiercely, and then stopped amazed. Apparently , the room was perfectly empty. Yet their conviction that they had, that very moment, been moving in the room had amounted to nearly 300 pounds. For half a minute, perhaps, they could imagine watching Mrs. Bunting went across the paper, and Mrs. Bunting seemed behind the screen, while Mr. Bunting, in a kindred impulse, went out on the desk. Mrs. Bunting turned back the window-curtains, and Mr. Bunting looked through the chimney and probed it with the sound. Meanwhile, Mrs. Bunting scrutinised the waste-paper basket while Mr. Bunting opened the lid of the box. Then they came to a point when they stood with eyes interrogating each other, "the money , she may not have sworn--" said Mr. Bunting. "The candle!" cried Mr. Bunting. "Who lit the candle?"
