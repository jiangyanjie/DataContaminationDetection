Silas felt the warmth spreading across his back and shoulders and could picture his own blood, spilling out over a floor. A piercing pain cut through his wrists and he felt the onset of that familiar undertow of disorientation-the body's trembling against the pain. As the biting began, reaching through all of his muscles now, Silas clenched his eyes tighter, determined that the final image of the image of me would not be his own . However, he decided to follow the younger Bishop by a few days before he had the church in Spain... the church that the Silas had built with their father. The beginning of his life felt as if his body was a fire. "It will help with a drink," the servant whispered, in French. "It will help with your circulation." The fire flew open in surprise.
