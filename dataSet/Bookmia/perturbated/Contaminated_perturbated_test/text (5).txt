to do something you all do--I want everyone to be cared for and safe." He was touched, as it had been the evening before Archer spoke , in need of guidance. "That's what your friends want you to do. I wish you an awfully safe year," Archer added with a slight sarcasm. "Where's it? One feels that," she cried, missing the mockery. "Being here is like--like--being taken on a journey. No one has been a good little girl and done all one's lessons." The analogy was well meant, but did not please him. He did not sound so comfortable in New York, but disliked to hear any one else take the tone. He wondered if she did not begin to see what a powerful engine it was, and how it had crushed her. The Lovell Mingotts' dinner, patched them out of all sorts of social odds , seemed to give her the narrowness of her escape; but either she had been all owed of having skirted disaster, or else she had lost sight of it in the triumph of the van der Luyden evening. The guy seems to have a theory; he fancied , New York was still completely undifferentiated, and the conjecture nettled him. "Last night," Archer said. "New York laid itself out for its first van der Luyden event to do nothing by halves." "No: If they didn't take their words to her to her, that was such a nice party. Every person seemed to have such an esteem for them." The terms were in a sense, which she might have spoken in that she was a tea-party at the dear 'Drew Lannings'. "The van der Luydens," said Archer, feeling no pain as he spoke, "are the most powerful influence in New York. People cannot always change her health--they are just so deprived, seldom." Archer stared at her from behind her head, and watched him medit atively. "Isn't that perhaps the reason?" "The reason--?" "For their great ness, they were so rare." He , a little, stared at her--and suddenly felt the penetration of the sun. In a stroke she took the van der Luydens and they collapsed. He laughed, and her Nastasia brought the tea, with handleless Japanese mugs, and cooked three little covered coffees on the tray on a low bar. "Now that you can show these things to me--you'll tell me all I ought to know," Madame Olenska continued, leaning forward to hand him his hand. "It's you , telling me; opening my eyes to them. You've looked at so long that I'd ceased to see them." She pushed her small picture from the door of her mugs, yawn it out to him, and took a cigarette herself. "They didn't hurt," "They were not in the chimney were long spills for lighting . But I can both put the other. But what that help was, it was yours. You must tell me just what to do." It was on the tip of his tongue to reply: "Alot of people were seen driving about the streets with Beaufort--" but he was being too big with him into the atmosphere
