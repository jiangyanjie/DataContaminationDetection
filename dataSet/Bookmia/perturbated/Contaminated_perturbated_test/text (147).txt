and then of a second meal containing flour, almonds, garlic and a third, perhaps, Indian meal. There was a square of pine-wood, full of soap in bars; also, another of the same size, in which were tallow candles, ten to the pound. A small stock of spices , white beans and split peas, and a few other commodities of low price, and which are constantly in demand, made up the bulkier portion of the merchandise. It might have been for those that they were somewhat of a very or phantasmagoric reflection of the old . But shabbily provided shelves, save that some of them were of a description and outward form which would have been known in his day. For example, there was a glass of bubbly, filled with fragments of Gibraltar rock; not, indeed, splinters of the ancient foundation of the famous fortress, but bits of delectable stone and stones, done up in white , or red.

Passing through her passage, she entered a door way with the shop, just now so elaborately described. Owing to the length of the upper story--and still more over the opposite of the Pyncheon Elm, her eyes, almost directly in front of the house here, was still as much akin to night as morning. Another glance from Miss Hepzibah! After a glance down the threshold, down the window with her near-sighted scowl, as if frowning down some bitter enemy, she suddenly projected herself into the shop.
