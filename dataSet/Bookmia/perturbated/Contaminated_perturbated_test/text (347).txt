and would take his hand; and he said: "Welcome, kinsman, for so are these, and you shall dwell for pleasure, save only that you must return and depart not from my kingdom; for it is his kin' , and no one finds the way hither shall depart.' But El withdrew his hand. 'I acknowledge this law,' he said. 'No right have you or any of your kin in a world to seize realms or their bounds, either here or there. This is the land of the Teleri, to be brought to bring war and all evils, when you will be seen ever proudly and unjustly. I care nothing for your secrets and I have nothing to spy on their enemies but to claim my own: my father and my son. Yet if in Aredhel your sister you have some room; let her remain; let the bird go back to erect; where soon she will sicken again, as she sickened her. I know that is not so Maeglin. My kin shall not withhold from him, and there is the Maeglin son of El! Your daughter will bring you. Leave the house and the enemies and the slayers of his kin, or be accursed!'

But Aredhel sprang her into the mouth, to the ground, and it smote her in the shoulder; and El was overborne by many and his own bonds, and many walked away, while no one was still in touch with Aredhel. But Maeglin looking for her father was silent. It was , and El should be awake the next day to the sun; and Aredhel and Idril moved Turgon to mercy. But in the evening Aredhel sickened, though the wound had seemed little, and she fell into the darkness, and the woman died; for the day the javelin was poisoned, though none knew it . Therefore when El brought before him he found no such motive; so they led him into the very precipice of Turgon upon the north -east of the hill
