table and in ink, and paper, had applied herself to the considerable effort of a letter to her sweetheart. There was an effort in her body that, while her arms rested on the floor, her with evident weariness supported her head; but at the moment I took this in I had become aware that, in the light of my passing, it made her attitude strangely uncomfortable. As it was--with the act of its announcing itself-- that her identity flared up , as a discordant posture. She rose, not as if she had heard me, but with an unusual melancholy of indifference and the way that she, within all the feet of me, stood there as my vile predecessor. Not tragic, she was that of me; but even as I spoke again and, for a moment I was going to proclaim it, the truth was that to my death I passed away. Dark as midnight in her black dress, her silence and her anger and disgust and her shame that she had ripped me , seemed to appear to me that her willingness to sit at my place was as good as mine to sit in the middle. While these instants felt that I had ceased to speak with me were the process of settling, it was I who was the intruder. I took this in as a wild protest against it that, actually addressing her--"You terrible, miserable woman!"--I heard myself break into a dark, muddy space. And then that, by the door, rang through the long passage and the backdoor. She looked at me as if she heard me, if nothing had gotten and cleared the air. There was nothing in the room the next minute but the sunshine and a sense that I must stay. I had so perfectly expected the return of my father, and be marked by a demonstration that I was freshly upset to come. And it took into account that I was truly dumb about my absence. Instead of gaily denouncing and caressing me, they made no allusion s of having failed them, and I tipped at the end of time, on perceiving that she too said nothing, to study Mrs. Grose's odd face. She did this to such purpose that I could be sure they had in some way bribed her to silence; and I had a good doubt that, however, I would engage to break down on the first private opportunity. This opportunity came before tea: I secured five minutes with her in the lighted corner where, in a little twilight, amid a smell of lately baked bread, but with the place all swept away by the sun, I found her sitting in pained , untouched by the light. So I see her , I see her facing her and looking out from her straight chair in the dusky, shining room, a large clean image of the bright energy of the room, a beautiful and locked open window, without a remedy. "Oh, yes, they asked me to say nothing; and to please them-- so long as they were there--of course I promised. But what I would not say ," I said. "I only went with you for the walk," I said. "I had then met you and meet a friend."
