trailing down the corridor. It was thrown from the man who walked softly down the passage with a handful of pieces held against his hand. He was in shirt and trousers, with no covering to his feet. I could merely see the outline, but the height told me it was Barrymore. He walked quietly and circumspectly, and there was something indescribably guilty about him in his appearance. I have told you that the path is broken by the balcony which runs out to the main hall, and is resumed along the farther side. I waited until he had passed out of the door and then I followed him. When I stopped on the way, he had reached the entrance of the farther corridor, and I could see from the glimmer s behind the open door that he had entered one of the rooms. At the point these rooms were unfurnished and unoccupied so that his expedition became more mysterious than ever. The light shone steadily as if he were having a look around it. I crept up the passage as noiselessly as I could see round the corner of the door. Barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against me.

I have had a long talk with Sir Henry <extra_id_27> and we have made a plan of campaign founded upon my last night. I do not speak about it just now, but it should make my next report interesting reading. Chapter 22: The Story of Dr. Paul , UPON THE MOOR Baskerville Hall, Oct. 15th. MY DEAR : I was compelled to leave you without much news during the early days of the blog, and you must acknowledge that I need to sign up for lost time, and that events are too thick and fast upon us. In my last report I ended upon a note with me at the end of the last page. But now I have quite a budget already which will, unless I am to make a budget, considera- bly surprise you. Things have taken a turn which I will have to see, and in some ways they will be the last forty- eight years, and some have become much clearer and
