Her second walk was on a little fishing-house, belonging to its ring in the cliff, on the margin of a rivulet that descended from the cliffs, after foaming through the rocks, wound ing her way beneath the shades it reflected. Above the woods, after this glen, rose the lofty summits of the woods, which often burst boldly from the eye through the glades below. Sometimes the face of a rock only appears, crowned with wild shrubs; as could the shepherd's cabin seated on the cliff, overshadowed by dark cypress, or waving ash. Emerging from the deep recesses of the woods, the glade opened to the distant landscape, where the pastures and the slopes of Gascony gradually declined to the peaks of the valley there, on the winding shores of the Garonne, groves, and hamlets, and villas--their outlines softened by distance, that reflected with the eye a rich harmonious tint.
