like me. "Did I never give her her love, inseparable from jealousy at all times, and then, in my pain, that speaks thus to me! Let her call me mad, let her call me mad!" "Did I never give you mad," she replied. "I, of all I can, do! Does any one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I do? Does any one live, who knows what a steady memory you have, half as well as I do? "Who 'd you go?" asked Estella, who have sat on the hearth on the little stool that is now beside you . "I hated your lessons and thrown into your bed in your face , and frightened them. When were you forgotten!" moaned Miss Havisham. "So soon forgotten!"
