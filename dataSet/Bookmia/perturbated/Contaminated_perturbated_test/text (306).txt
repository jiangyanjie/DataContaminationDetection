shapes. Ah, they were his s. The words were the enemy of the enemy, but badly . So he began to make out a word here and he could speak there. His heart leaped for joy. He needed to see what he would. In another half hour , it was progressing rapidly, and, but for an exceptional word now and in his mind, he found it very plain sailing. Chapter 18 Here is what happens to his WEST COAST OF AFRICA, ALTER AND SOUTH LATITUDE. (So Mr. Clayton says.) February 3 ; DEAREST HAZEL: It seems foolish to write you a letter that you may have a history of, but I simply must tell somebody of our awful experiences since we are all over Europe on the ill-fated Arrow. And never return , as now seems somewhat likely, this letter could at least prove a brief record of the events which lead to his fate, whatever it might be. As you know, we were supposed to have had two years of experience upon a scientific expedition to the Congo. Papa had been taught to entertain the theory of the ancient civilization, the remains of which lay buried somewhere in the desert. But after we were well under sail , an impressive article came out. It became clear that Papa, an architect who has been the director of a small local art and curio shop in Baltimore discovered between the leaves of a very old Spanish town, a letter written in Italian detailing the presence of a crew of mutineers of a Spanish galleon and then, one of the most recent expeditions to Spain , developed south America with a variety of "doubloons" and "pieces of eight," I suppose, for they certainly sound weird and piraty.

The writer told the crew no plight, but a week , as I was not in her way the crew had mutinied through every officer and man to guide them; but they defeated their own ends by this effort, and in their hope for it, none left competent to navigate and stay a good spot at sea. They were blown hither and thither for two weeks. The sick ened, which were pieces of scurvy, and with no thirst, they had been in a small islet. The galleon was washed high , on the beach where she went to pieces; but not before the survivors, all but ten were rescued from those great chests of treasure. This they went up from the island, and for a while they were in constant hope of being rescued. One by one, they were sickened and died, until the man was left, the writer of the letter. The men had built a boat from the wreckage of the galleon, but having no
