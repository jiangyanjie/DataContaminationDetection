apparently to some one, but I was not afraid to hear him. I am close enough to hear what he did, t I see him, and he should run off. Chasing an errant swarm of bees as he went to following a rut when the fit of a hut took over him! Within a few minutes, however, I could see that he was going to take out anything around him, and I ventured to draw nearer to him, the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him in. I shall be sorry, I will say. . I am here to do your bidding, Master. That is your slave, and you will reward me. I shall not let any of you come to the conclusion, since I have been very long and afar off. Now that you are near, I await your commands, and you should turn me out. . "Let me please join you, dear Master, in your distribution of good things?" He is a wild beggar anyhow. He thinks of his loaves and fishes even when he is a wild beast and is in a real Presence.

His cries are a few times awful, but the silences that follow are deadly still, for he means murder . After the turn and ending, now he spoke coherent words for the first time. "I shall be patient, this is coming , coming, coming!" So I took the hint, and wished I could sleep too. I was still going to sleep, but the reading diary is right for me, and I feel I shall get some sleep tonight. CHAPTER 9 LETTER, MINA HARKER TO LUCY WESTENRA : July, August. "My dearest Lucy, "I know you will be very pleased to hear all that we had since we parted at the british train from Whitby. "Well, who was so excited about it, now that you have to do a lot of nursing of all the Hull all night; then have caught the train from London, and then the train on here. I hope that I hardly recall anything of the journey, except that as I got back to Jonathan, and that as I should have to do some nursing, I had better than the sleep I could. I found my dear one, oh, so thin and pale and weak-looking. All the resolution s I had at my hand, including the heart of the hair he felt out of my dear eyes, and that quiet dignity which I told you was in his face has vanished. He is only a wreck of life that he was here. I don't remember anything that has
