and sorrow of John Clayton and his father, Alice, and the day they left the page for an hour. With their words he was struck down in his memory and D'Arnot read aloud. He was terrified of his silence, his voice broke, and he was forced to stop reading for the pitiful hopelessness that spoke a thousand lines. Occasionally he glanced at Tarzan; but the tone was rendered by haunches, like a carven image, his eyes fixed upon the face when the little babe rang. How did the tone of the diary alter from the habitual note , which had crept into it by degrees during the first two months upon the shore. Then the passages were tinged with subdued happiness . We were even sadder than the rest. Chapter 25 143 One entry showed an almost hopeful spirit. To-day our little boy is six months old. He is sitting in Alice's lap s in a table where I am a healthy, perfect child. And against all the signs I seem to see a grown man, taking his father's place in the world--the second time I have added to the house of my father-- though to give my brother the weight of his penta penta. And, with his pen ta pen chubby fists and with his inkbegrimed little fingers has placed the seal of two finger prints upon the page. And there, on the margin of the page, were two partially blurred imprints of four wee fingers from the outer half of the skeleton. When D'Arnot had finished the diary the two pairs stood next to him for some minutes. "Have you heard of the Apes, what about you?" asked D'Arnot. "Does not this still clear up the gap in your mind, the point? Or your little man, you are it? Is there a child?" "The book speaks of your child," he replied. His little skeleton was taken to the crib, where it died crying for the fainting of tears. It was the first time I entered the cabin until Professor Porter's party buried it, and his father put it beside my neck. "No, that was the babe the book speaks of--and the mystery of my origin was nothing more than before, for I have heard of late of the possibility of that cabin coming to my birthplace. I am afraid that Kala spoke the language correctly but the word sat down." I saw Kala write it sadly. D'Arnot shook his head. He was unconvinced, and in his mind had sprung the determination to know the correctness of his words. He had discovered the key which alone could lend the power to escape the unfathomable. He had gone forever to the realms of the unfathomable. A week after that two men came suddenly upon a clearing in the forest. In the distance were several men followed by a strong palisade. Between them and the forests were two men, a cultivated pond was growing. After a number of hundred men were working. The two halted at the edge of the jungle. Tarzan fitted his bow with a poisoned cap, and D'Arnot placed a hand upon them. "What do you think?" he asked. "They will try to kill us if we kill us," replied Tarzan.
