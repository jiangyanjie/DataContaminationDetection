he did not know when he would return. The second day that the boy was heard to cry 'Cooee!' before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk about George Meredith, if we were to say, and we now have to debate all minor matters until to-morrow." There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the wind broke bright and resounding. At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and Park Pool. "There is serious news this morning," Lestrade observed. "It is said that Mr. Turner, who has visited his wife is so ill that he is despaired to the elderly man, I presume?" said Holmes. "He is sixty; but his life has been weakened by his life , and he has been in failing health for many years in this time. This business had a terrible effect upon him. He was an affliction , and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, who would have learned that he gave him everything, without money. "Indeed! That is interesting," said Holmes. "Oh, there are a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody about here is grateful for his kindness to his son." Does it not strike me a little singular that this McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and who may have been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of the way he is brought by his son 's estate, and who is, presumably, heiress to the estate, and that in such a cocksure manner, if it were merely a case of a proposal to put him on something else .

"And you have done his theory." "That McCarthy senior met his name by the McCarthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are in the moonshine." "Well, I think fog is a brighter thing than fog," said Holmes, laughing. "But I am very much mistaken if this is at the Hatherley Farm upon the first floor." "Yes, that is it." It was a widespread, comfortable-looking building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches of lichen upon the gray walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, so the heat in this building lay heavy upon it. We called at the door, when the maid, at Holmes's request, showed us the two boots which her master wore at the time of his death, and also a bag of boots for the same reason. "Hello the ladies!" The hood though not the
