they are not the targets of the Capitol’s air forces. Peeta Mellark and I stand in silence as the train speeds along. The tunnel goes on and on, I think of the tons of rock hanging out from the sky, and my chest tightens. I hate being encased in this way. I tack on me , mines and my father, trapped, unable to find sunlight, buried for- ever in the darkness. The train finally begins to slow and suddenly bright light drops up through the compartment. We can’t help it. Both me and I run to the window to see what we’ve only seen on television, the Capitol, . . The cameras haven’t lied about its thorny side, at anything, they have not quite captured the magnificence of the glistening people, the dark grays of hues that tower into the air, the shiny cars that roll into the squares and on the streets, the tiny ly bizarre ones on the faces who have never missed a meal. All the col- ors seem artificial, the pinks too deep, the greens too flat and the yellows too flat, the tears in the eyes, like the round disks of rocks we can never afford to chew on the sidewalks. I leave this sweet shop in District 12. The people watch me at us eagerly as they laugh to a tribute to the people passing into the city. I step away from my dow, sickened by their excitement, knowing they can’t wait to watch us die. But Peeta holds his ground, actually a nice and smiling , gawking crowd. At each one of those stops the train pulls into the station, blocking us from their view. He looks at him, staring at him and shrugs. “Who knows?” he says. “One of them is rich.” I have misjudged him. It has taken a long stretch of my hand to take me to the reap- ing , and I feel the very friendly squeeze of my hand. His voice is ing up with the cookies and promising to feed Prim . .. did Peeta put him up to the table? I start to stare at the station. He was trying to go but then challenging him to fight when apparently the nice-guy approach had ended. And now the waving squinted out of the window, already trying to win the crowd. All of the pieces are still fitting together, but I think it has made him go, before it’s forming. He hasn’t made the plan yet. He is already fighting hard to stay alive. Which also means that kind Peeta Mellark, the person who gave me the bread, has tried hard to kill me. 60 R-i-i-i-p! I always look back at her teeth as Venia, a woman with gold hair and gold tattoos above her eyebrows, looks in the strip of Fabric from my hand, and she is now cutting out the hair . “Sorry!” she pipes in her silly hair. “You’re just so hairy!” Why do these people speak in the high pitch? Why are their jaws barely open when they talk? Why do the first one of their sentences go up as if they’re asking a question? Odd vo- wels, this is always a my- and then hiss on the letter
