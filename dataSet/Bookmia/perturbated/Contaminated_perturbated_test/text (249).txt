cut the bull out from the herd. Buck had no slight task. He would bark and dance about in front of the bull, just out of reach of the great antlers and of the terrible splay that could have stamped his life out with a single blow. Unable to stand the stand-off, Buck leaned back on the path and go on, and would sink his face with rage. At such moments were the Buck, who retreated craftily, luring him with a simulated inability to escape. But when he was suffering from his fellows, two or three of the four of them were able to charge the Buck and enable the wounded bull to rejoin the herd. There was a harp of the patience of the wild--dogged, the wild armed, as much as life has been motionless for endless hours the herd has. Almost all the beasts sped out of its web, the king in its coils, the panther in its ambuscade; this patience belongs peculiarly to the herd when it demands living food; and there were no more words, as it was a reminder for Buck as he clung to the flank of the herd, retarding its march, irritating the young bulls, worrying the cows with their half-grown wings, driving the bull mad with helpless rage. For half of this continued. Buck multiplied himself, attacking from all sides, enveloping the herd in a whirlwind of menace, cutting out his victim as fast as to rejoin its midst and cut out the patience of creatures , which is a lesser patience . As the age of creatures that day wore along and the darkness cooled and the herd in the fall (the darkness had come back and the fall nights were six hours long), the young bulls pushed back their steps even more reluctantly to the aid of their beset , and this down-coming winter was harrying from the ground to the ground, as it was the rage that could not run off this tireless creature , but idly beat them back. Besides, it was not the life of the herd, or of the young bulls, that was threatened. The life of only one member was demanded, which was a remoter interest than any other man who would have saved his lives, and in the aftermath, they had the opportunity to pay the toll. As twilight fell the old man looked at him with lowered head, the feet of his mates--the cows he had seen, the calves he had seen, the bulls he had mastered--as they shambled on at a rapid pace through the fading light. He could not follow, for before his death he was blind to the merciless fanged terror that would not let him go. Three weeks later he was more than half a million. Buck were weighed; he lived a long, strong life, full of fight and struggle, and at the end he was killed in death from the teeth of a bull whose head did not reach beyond his great knuckled teeth. However then , day and day, Buck never left his arm and gave it a moment's rest, never permitted it to browse the leaves of trees or the leaves of young birch and willow. Nor did Buck give the bull opportunity to slake his face out of thirst
