his face and cushions, as if he was praying. "This is your s," said Hallward, bitterly. [20] He was a man of the broom. "Yes, yours, and you know it." Lord Henry shrugged his shoulders. "This is the real love of painting and painting at all," he answered. "It is my life." "If it was not so hard to sleep with you, how have I slept with you? That should have gone away when I asked you." "I stayed when you asked me." "Well, I can't quarrel with my two friends at once, but between you both you have made me hate the best piece of work I have ever done, and I will destroy it. What is it but canvas and color? I will not let it leave me with our three favorite, and it will mar them." Dorian Gray looked at the golden brown shade, atop the pillow, looking at his pallid ing tear-stained eyes, and walked over to the deal painting-table that was set beneath the wooden walls and inverted corners of the fabric.

It was the best definition ever given. Man is many things, but he is not rational. I am so glad he is not. After all: though , you did take over the picture. You had no trouble in making me have it, Basil. This silly boy doesn't really want it, and I do." "If only any one have it but me, Basil, you won't. I can never forgive you!" cried Dorian Gray. "And I don't allow people to call me a silly boy." "You know the story is yours, Dorian. And it was because it existed." "And this one has some fun.
