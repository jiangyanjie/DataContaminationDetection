Other readers place more emphasis on the power of her. Eliot dissects Silas' psychological processes. She is a bit more accurate on how he felt when he left it, how he felt like a miser, how he reacts to his theft of gold, how Eppie's presence heals him and draws him back into the mainstream of life.

Whereas Silas is unjustly executed, the judge knows it, and Godfrey manages to escape punishment, while Silas finds the sins of Godfrey as committed. Some readers, however, view Godfrey as the villain of this great story. His weakness sets Dunstan on a path that ends with Dunstan robbing Silas. While Godfrey is grieving his wife, Elizabeth, and gold, Godfrey is relieved in that he has an addiction to life. He is relieved, too, when his wife Molly is found dead in the snow, because it clears the way for him to marry Nancy . By the end of the book, Godfrey decided to take Eppie away from Silas.
