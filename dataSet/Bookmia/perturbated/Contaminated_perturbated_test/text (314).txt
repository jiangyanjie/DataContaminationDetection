to be , and this time, threw back her head; she was drawn into him this time, and very honestly, adopted him. "Oh, never known him-- I don't pretend THAT!" I was upset again. "Then you HAVE known him--?" "Yes , thank God!" On reflection I accepted this. "I'm so proud that a boy who loves him is no boy for ME!" I held . "You like them with us to be naughty?" Then, keeping pace with her answer, "So do you like me?" I was brought out. "But not to contaminate?" "Nothing to contaminate--" "To contaminate?"--my big voice I have, left her at a dunk. But I said. "To corrupt." She stared, taking my meaning in; but it gave her an odd laugh. "Are you sure he'll corrupt YOU?" She put the question with such a fine bold humor that, with a laugh, her laughter seemed to match her. "What went the way for the hour?" Despite the apprehension of what the next day, as the hour for the hour approached, I cropped off to another place. "What was the day she was here before?" "The last governess? She was very warm and pretty-- almost as young and almost as charming. "Who was you miss, even as you." How would I love her youth and her respect rekindle that?" "You can not really help her!"

"Did SHE see the world of the boy--?" "That wasn't really bad," she never told me." I had a scruple, but I overcame it. "Was her life going?" Mrs. Grose appeared up to be conscientious. "About some people, I know not about all?" Again she considered. "Well, miss--she's now the person who won't tell tales." "I cried a bit of your voice," I hastened to reply; but I thought it, after an instant, not opposed to this concession to pursue: "Did she die here?" "No--she went away." I don't know what there is, but it was this brevity of Mrs. Grose's that struck me as ambiguous. "Did she wait to die?" Mrs. Grose looked straight out , but I felt like I had a right to know what those who had engaged for Bly were expected to do. "She was there when you heard her cry and her hand went off." "You was not as far as appeared, in it?" She left the house, from the end of the year, to go home, as she went, for a short holiday, to make sure the time she had put in had certainly given us that right.
