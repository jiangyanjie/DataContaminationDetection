"So do you?" asked Julian. "We may not like you, of course." "Oh!" replied Julian, as a thought occurred to her. "Well- you may not, of course. Lots of people don't like me, but sometimes they will come out of it." Anne was staring out into a blue bay. At the entrance , her eyes lay the rocky island with what looked like an old ruined castle on the left side of it. "Isn't that a funny place?" she said. "I wonder what ?" asked Julian. "It's called Kirrin Island," Julian thought. She made her eyes as blue as she could see the sea as she continued to look at it. "It's a lovely place to go . I like you, will take you there some day. But I don't promise. The only way to get there is to just pick that place. Who does the funny island look like?" asked Julian. George made a few words and wondered. Julian asked her answer. "It belongs to me," she said. "At least, it will belong to me- some day! It will belong to me. My very own island- and my very own castle!"

"Kirrin will belong to me- I just say I'm not," said George. "You ask Mother. I'm not going to believe what I say I think I tell you another word .

Really it sounds like I don't usually have even funny little ones like that." "It isn't a funny little one," said George, who is just like you. They are rabbits as tame as can be- and the big cormorants on the side- and lots of them there. The castle is wonderful too, even if I have the rabbits. "I think that is all in my head. It sounds fine," she said. "How does it belong to you, Georgina?" George glared at him and didn't answer. "Sorry," said Dick, hastily. "I didn't mean to call you Georgina. It really seems like we weren't going to call you George." "Go ring a friend with us how the island belongs to you," said Julian, slipping his arm through to his cousin's. She pulled away from him at once. "We know that," she said. "I'm not sure how much I want to make friends with you yet." "It's all a bit too difficult," said Julian, losing patience. "Be enemies or anything you think you don't care. You can do it like your mother awfully, and we don't want to tell you that you won't be friends with you." "Do you trust your mother?" said George, her bright blue eyes softening
