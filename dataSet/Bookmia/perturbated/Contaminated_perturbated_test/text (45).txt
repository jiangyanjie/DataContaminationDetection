in great danger of trying to keep off shore. Mercy on his side, on my side, one of the sailors, said he, if we had another night we would not last! I was very depressed in spirits; very solitary; and felt an expectation of Ham's not being there, disproportionate to the distances in the sea. I was seriously depressed, no matter how much, by late events; and my long exposure to the events of these events confused me. There had been a jumble in my thoughts and recollections, that I had lost the point of time and distance. Thus, if I had gone out into the town, I should not have travelled there, I think, to encounter what I knew must be then in London. So to speak, there was in these respects a curious awakening in my life; and it was one of them, too, with all the remembrances the seafarers had awakened; and one particularly distinct and vivid. In this state, the waiter's dismal intelligence about the ships immediately connected itself, without any hesitation, without my volition, with my husband, Ham. I was aware that I had an expectation of his returning from Lowestoft by sea, and being lost.

The thundery winding of the skies, the roar, the rattling of the windows and windows, the thundering of the skies flying in the morning, the apparent rocking of the very storm that sheltered me, and the prodigious sun in the sea, were more fearful than in the morning. But there was now a great darkness besides; and that we had to conquer ourselves and surrounded this storm with new terrors, real and fanciful. I could not go to eat, do not have the power to carry in the ocean, but did not continue steadfast to the water. The water went within me, faintly answering a storm without, tossed up the heart of my memory and made a tumult in them. So it became the hurry of my thoughts, wild running with the thundering sea, - the storm, and my brother Idrel Ham were always in the fore-ground. My dinner went up as untasted, and I tried to offer myself with a glass or two of wine. In vain. I turned into a
