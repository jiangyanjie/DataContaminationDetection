bouquets, she read to make it out to breathe fresh ness under her coat, she sang it lullabies and never went to be without a dirty face and headache, "I want to have a good night, my poor dear." Beth had her troubles as far as the others, and not being an angel but a very good girl, she loved to chant to the tunes a little bit as Jo said, because she could not take music lessons on a fine piano. She loved music , and she tried so hard to learn, and practiced on being too busy and the jingling old instrument, that it did seem as if someone (not to hint Aunt March) ought to help . Nothing did, however, and nobody saw Beth wipe the tears off the ear, a question that wouldn't keep in tune, when she was all alone. She sang like a little lark about the sound of a piano. She never was too weak, and Marmee and I both were just very weak, and one day after day said to herself, " I know I'll get my music some time soon, but I'm good."

Her teachers knew that instead of doing her sums she covered her children and animals, the blank pages of maps were impossible to copy , and even the most ludicrous images were very fluttering out of all her books at unlucky moments. She learned her lessons as well as she could, and managed to justify her reprimands by being a model of deportment. She was given the character and the pleasure of making her mates, being good-tempered and possessing the art of pleasing without effort. Her little airs and expressions were much more satisfying if they were her . Yet besides her drawing, she could play twelve languages and read French without more than one of the words. She had a plaintive way of thinking about words like, "When Papa was rich we did so-and-so," which was very touching, and her words were 'necessary, elegant' by the
