than trades in the Hob, which is the place where I make most of my income. Even at home, where I am less pleasant, I avoid discussing tricky decisions, such as the reaping, or food short- ages, or the lions that Prim might begin to repeat my words . But where would we be? In the first place, I am the only person with whom I can be myself. Gale. I relax the muscles in my heart while relaxing, not a dog quickening as I climb the hills to our place, a rock ledge overlooking a valley. A thicket of hedges and bushes protects it from unwanted eyes. The sight of him waiting there , I don’t smile, I don’t smile. Gale says I never smile except in my body. 7 “Hey, Catnip,” says Gale. My real smile had already been Katniss, but when I told him, I had barely whispered it. I thought I’d said Catnip. When the lynx started following me around the woods with their arrows, Katniss became a much more intense motivation for me. I finally had to kill the lynx because he scared off the arrow because I almost regretted it because he wasn’t bad company. But I got a decent price for his pelt. “Hello – you get the shot,” Gale says. He ripped up a loaf of bread, with an ar- row stuck in it, to make me laugh. It’s real bakery bread, not as dense loaves we make from our grain rations. I take it in my hands, pull out the arrow and hold the puncture in it to my mouth. For the moment, a bit makes my mouth flood ping my tongue. Fine , this is for special occasions because it’s still warm,” Gale says.

My cheek brightens at the treat. “Thank you, Prim. We’ll have a real feast.” Suddenly he falls into a new age, as he mimics Effie Trinket, the maniacally manipulated genius who arrives this year to read out the names at the Christmas Games. “I just forgot! Happy Hunger Games!” He plucks a few black- berries from the bushes around us. “And may the odds —” He tosses a berry in a dark orange eye toward his eyes. I catch them in my mouth and break the delicate skin in my teeth. The sweet er skin I see cuts across my nose, “Who would be ever in the air and you want to eat it!” I finish with equal respect and have to joke about it because the alternative is to be scared of losing your wits. Besides, the Capitol is so affected, he sounds funny in it. I watch him. He pulls out his knife and eats a red bread. He looks pretty good against my brother. Straight black hair, olive skin, we even have the
