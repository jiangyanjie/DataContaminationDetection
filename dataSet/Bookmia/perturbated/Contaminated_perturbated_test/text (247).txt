that nobody pushed in his direction. I tried to say it out. His choice, he told himself, surprised how little remorse he felt for what he had just done. I believed he had decided his own fate. The Teacher had feared all along that the school might need to be eliminated when the mission was complete, but his decision to prevent it from stopping in the Temple at the time had accelerated over time and moved the school dramatically. Robert Langdon's unexpected visit to Chteau Villette had brought his reaction to a serious situation and an immediate shock. Langdon had pointed the keystone directly to the heart of the operation, making it a pleasant surprise, and yet he had brought up a bit of a knock on his tail. Both of them were all at Chteau Villette, as she pointed out in the past post, where Rmy had witnessed the teacher being in two shoes. The Teacher was grateful he had taken much care in explaining ties between Rmy's activities and his own. Nobody could implicate the teacher when Rmy talked, and that was only a concern. By the time it was a loose end to tie up here, the Teacher turned now to the rear , with him in the limousine. The police will have to wait for what happened... and no living witness left behind them.

The huge sphere mounted atop the tomb was almost as large as the tomb itself. The presence of the orb seemed both encouraging and 259 troubling to the Teacher. On the first page, it felt like a signpost, and yet, according to the poem, the top of the puzzle was an orb that ought to be on his tomb... not one that he had ever found out there. He was counting on a closer inspection of the tomb to unveil the puzzle. The teacher was getting a feeling, and he tucked the orb deep in his left pocket to save it from the dampness.
