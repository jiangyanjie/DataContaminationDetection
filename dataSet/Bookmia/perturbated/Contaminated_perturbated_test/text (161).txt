have gone on my way . I felt any vocation to renew inquiries; but the absence of this man, in the roughness of the traveler, set the subject to my ease: I retained my station ; he sounded near my station; he gave me a phone and announced: "I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary lane, till you, you are fit to mount your horse."
