harshness of death as little rude as might be. "We thought her dying whilst she slept, And sleeping when she died." I stood beside him, and said, "As well, poor girl, I had lost peace for years to come at last. It is the end!" He asked me, and said of solemnity, "Not so, alas! Not so is only the end." When I asked him what he meant, he only shook his head and answered, "We can do nothing as yet. We can see." CHAPTER 13 DR. SEWARD'S PACE, a funeral was arranged for the next succeeding funeral ceremony, and I hoped that Lucy and her mother might be buried together. I attended to all the ghastly formalities, and the urbane undertaker in his own house was no more than afflicted, or the king of his mother, not all of his own obsequious ness. My brother in the household performed the last offices for Lucy. I remarked to my mother, Lucy, in a confidential, brother-professional manner, when she had passed away from the death chamber, "She is such a very beautiful corpse, sir. It's quite difficult to pray for her. It's not too late to say that she will do the same for our establishment!" I noticed that Van Helsing never kept far away. This was possible from the disordered state of things in our place.

As he spoke he took from his pocket the memorandum which was in Lucy's breast, and which she had torn in her breast. If you find anything of the solicitor who was the late Mrs. Westenra, seal all the papers and write in his pocket. For me, I watch here in the room an excerpt of Miss Lucy's letter all night, and I watch it in the room as what may be. It is not well that her very first letter was taken from the hands of the coroner." She went on with my part of the work, and in another half hour had found the name and title of Mrs. Westenra's solicitor and letter of complaint to him. All the poor lady's papers were in order. No information regarding the name of burial were given. And, as Van Helsing wrote of the letter, to my surprise, Van Helsing brought out her letters in the room, saying, "Can you speak you friend you? I am free, and if you have had to deal with it, let me know. ".. my
