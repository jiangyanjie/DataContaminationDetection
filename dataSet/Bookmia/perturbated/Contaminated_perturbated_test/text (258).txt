not to be talked to as to Mr. Craven's orders. His troubles are none servants' business, he says. But for th' garden he wouldn't be more concerned with it. It is. It was Mrs. Craven's orders as the best friend she had made when first they married. an' she just loved it, an' they needed to 'tend the flowers themselves. An' none o' an was ever let to go in. An' her used to eat till an', an' she would shut down' and an' stay a' an' hours, readin' and talkin'. An, an' just a bit of a young girl an' there was an old gardener th' branch bent like a seat on it. An' she made the wythe over it an' she used to get in there. But one day when she was sittin' there th' branch where she fell on the side th' an' was hurt so bad that next day she fell and died. Th' doctors thought he'd go into his mind every day too. That's why he hates it. No one's never heard something about her. Ever since, an' he won't have one talk about him. Mary did not ask any question. She heard of the red fire and listened to the wind "wutherin'." It seemed to be "wutherin'" the most bad thing ever. At that point, a very good thing was happening to her.

It was inside, but it was inside. She turned round and looked at Martha. "I don't know it was right here?" But then Mary was able to hear any one crying, it said. Mary looked out and said so. Then she answered. "It's th' wind. Sometimes it was as if some one was lost on th' moor an' wailin'. It's got some t' o' sounds." "But in the house, it said to me, it's in the house--down one of the long corridors." And at that very moment a door must have appeared somewhere downstairs; for a while, the draft blew along the passage and the door of the room they sat in was blown open with a crash, and as they had to go to their feet the sound was blown out and the crying sound was swept down the far side of the staircase. The sound was so much like, that it was to be heard more than ever. "There!" said Mary. See you so! It is some one crying--and it
