they are married but you are disappointed." "I don't think I am likely to marry, Harry. I am too upset to marry and love. That is one of your aphorisms. I am putting it into the picture now. I do everything you say." "Whom are you not ?" "You are right." The Lord stared at him with a curious smile. "With an actress," said Dorian Gray, blushing. He shrugged . "That is my most common-place dbut," he murmured. "You would not say how you saw her, Harry." "Who is she?" "Her name is Sibyl Vane." "Never heard of her." "No . People will some day, however. She is a genius." "If you want to look old boy, no woman , no woman." "He's a genius: women are a decorative beauty; you never have anything to say, but they paint so charmingly.

I began to look at this gray, monstrous London of ours, with its myriads of people, its splendid castle and its sordid sins, as [25] you once said, as they were about to fly on me in search of things in store . I fancied a thousand things. "The mere sight of nature gave me a sense of delight. I remembered what you had said to me that I was being in the air when we first dined together, with the search of being the most incredible time of any life." I don't know what I expected, but I went out, and wandered eastward, soon
