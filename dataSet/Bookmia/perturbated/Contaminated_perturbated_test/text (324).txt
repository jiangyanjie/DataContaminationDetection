was to be thankful for. At all, it was not about the state of society; society, as could be said to exist, was rather a spectacle on which to call down the tide, and a societal spectacle for every one . "Tree," the Reverend Dr. Ashmore meant when he chose a text from Jeremiah (chap. ii., verse 25) for his Thanksgiving sermon. She said his name, the new Rector of St. Matthew's, had been chosen because of his "advanced": his character, who is considered bold in thought and novel in language. When he fulminated against fashionable society in 2010, Archer spoke of its "trend"; and to Mrs. Archer it was very clear, and yet fascinating , that he was becoming part of a community that was trending. "There's just one thing that everyone is right: there IS a trend," she said, adding that it were something visible and measurable, like a crack in a house. "It was odd, though, to preach on Sunday , maybe before we've met on the street." Miss Jackson and her hostess drily rejoined: "Oh, he said that I need to give thanks for what's left." Archer also wont to smile after the annual vaticinations of his mother's; but did even he was ashamed to acknowledge, as he listened to her to the enumeration of the trend; the "trend" was visible.
