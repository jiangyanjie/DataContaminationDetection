them to Menegroth. Then Thingol received Trin, and took Trin to his own fostering, in honour of Hrin the Steadfast; for she was at the houses of the Elf-friends. Thereafter messengers went north , bidding Morwen the Steadfast, and went out of die north to Haren; but still she continued to leave the house in which she had dwelt with Hrin. And when they had returned to his, Trin brought with them the Dragon-helm , the greatest of the heirlooms of the people of Hador. Trin grew very strong in Doriath, but was also marked with sorrow. For nine years he dwelt in Thingol's halls, and at the times in his own grief . But the thirst for their sons went at times to Hithlum, and they carried them in the tidings of Morwen and Nienor. But there came a time when the King could not return to die north, and the King would send him to The King. Then Trin was in fear for Thorn and his sister, and with the grimness of heart he went before the King and asked for mail , and she was on the Dragon-helm of Dor-lmin and went out to battle on the Dragon-helm of Doriath, and became the companion in arms of Beleg a. And as as many years had passed, Trin returned again to Menegroth; but he entered the wild, and was unkempt, and his gear and garments stood up against him.

On the next day Saeros waylaid Trin as he pulled Trin from Menegroth to return to his marches; but Trin overcame him, and set him to life as a hunted beast through the woods. He quickly ended up fleeing in , and fell into the shadow of a desert; his body was broken on a great rock in the water. But others coming saw the work had been done, and Mablung was among them; and he then took the return with Viktor to abide the judgement of the King, seeking his pardon. But Trin, deeming himself now an outlaw and fearing to be held in jail, escaped with Mablung's consent, and Hetai turned swiftly away; and passing through the Girdle -like tunnel he was on his way to the woods west of Melian. At his throne he joined himself to a band of all houseless and desperate men that could be found in the forest; and the evil days were scattered in the wild; and their hands were turned against . And they came in their midst, Men and Orcs and Men were found out. But when all that had befallen was told and searched out before Thingol,
