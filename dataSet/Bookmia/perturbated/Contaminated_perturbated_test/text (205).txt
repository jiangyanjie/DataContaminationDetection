after he has performed some dances, as if they were a disembodied spirit. I have another weird neighbor, who printed a beautiful sign in English and tacked it on the door of the cabin, whom we have preempted, warning us to destroy none of his belongings, and signing himself "Tarzan of the Apes". We have no idea what to do with him, though we think he is about, for that matter. Then the man who was going to shoot Mr. Clayton in the back, received a spear in his shoulder from some sailors, in the morning. The sailors left the cabin with a meager supply of food, and we have only a single revolver with but there is no guns left in it, and we do not know where we can procure enough food for ourselves. Mr. Philander says that we can exist indefinitely on the[O wild fruit and nuts which are] discarded in the jungle. I am very tired now, so I shall go to a bed of coffee Mr. Clayton gathered for me, but will add to my list from day to day as things go on. NO EVENT FILE PORTER. TO HAZEL STRONG, BALTIMORE, MD.

She was mystified; but when she gave up the printed letter and returned her signature, she felt a cold, clammy chill run up her spine. She showed the letter, on the sheet with a letter attached to Clayton. Chapter 18 "And to think," she said, "this thing was probably watching me see if this was the same time that I took the letter.
