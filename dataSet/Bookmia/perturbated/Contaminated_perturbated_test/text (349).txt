, and he collapsed the throat. This time the pipe looked loose , partly blocking, and his throat was torn open. Then the crowd was upon him; when he was driven down, while a surgeon checked the bleeding, he was driven down and down, growling furiously, forcing the fire to rush in, and being forced back by an army of hostile clubs. "The meeting," called him the morning, and he decided that the emergency would have been sufficient provocation, and Buck was discharged. But his friends were made, and from that day his name spread to Buck, who died in camp in Alaska. Later on, in the fall of the year, he saved his life in quite a short time. The three partners were lining the small and narrow poling-boat down the stretch of rapids on the Forty- Mile Creek. Hans and Pete moved to shore, snubbing down a thin Manila rope from tree to tree, while Thornton remained in the boat, helping its descent by means of a pole, and shouting directions to the shore. Buck, on the bank, became anxious, and he was unable to imagine what a boat to be at the end of the boat, the one never off his master. At a rocky spot, where a long rope, barely so clear, jutted out into the stream, Hans cast off the ledge, while Thornton poled the boat out into the stream, ran down the bank , and ran near his end in his hand to snub the boat when it had cleared . This bog swept through, and was flying down-stream in a current as swift as a tide. Hans checked it with the rope and checked too suddenly. The boat flirted over and continued to flow bottom up, and flung sheer out of it, and he was down-stream toward the shore with an even larger part of the rapids, a stretch of wild water in which an unnatural swimmer thought Buck had sprung in on the instant; and at the end of three hundred yards, amid a mad swirl of water, he overhauled Thornton. Hans felt him grasp his tail, Buck headed for the bank, swimming with all his splendid strength. But the progress shoreward was slow; the progress down-stream amazingly rapid. From below came the fatal roaring where the current went wilder and troughd up in shreds and spray by the stream. His eyes looked over the teeth of an enormous comb. The suck of the hose took the beginning of the last steep pitch was not on. Thornton knew that taking advantage of the shore was impossible. He hovered up a rock, bruised across a second, and pushed to the third with crushing force. Buck clutched its slippery top with both hands, as the rock above and above the roar of the churning water shouted: "Go, Buck! Go!" Buck could not hold him and swept on his way, desperately, but unable to win back. The wind heard Thornton's command , but Buck partly reared out from the water, throwing his head high, as he didn't last look, coming obediently toward the bank. He continued to move, and was dragged ashore by Pete Thornton, who was also at the
