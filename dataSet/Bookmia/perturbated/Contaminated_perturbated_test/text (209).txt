"Am you thought of nothing ?" Philip questioned about." He saw the pain come into Lawson's eyes, because he could not imagine why he was sorry, but he had to think of himself; he could not bear the pain of thinking about himself. After the situation, he could save himself only by determining resolutely not to think about himself. Philip was afraid of his guilt and began to burn his heart. Moreover, he took irresistible dislikes to the point of being so bad, because he became a man that he had done ; he did just not care about what humiliation he had endured . Philip had waited in that studio, faced no hunger, tried to offer a meal, and the last occasion when he had taken the five shillings off him. He hated the sight of Lawson, because he had done a good job on those days of utter abasement. "Then look here, to dine with me one night. Choose your own evening." Philip was completely impressed with the painter's kindness. All sorts of people were strangely pleased with him, he thought. "It's awfully bad to see you, old man, but I'd rather not." He held out his hand. "Good-bye." Lawson, troubled by the world's atmosphere, which seemed inexplicable, took over, and the life had come back up very quickly . His mind was heavy; and, once usual with him, he was unwilling to reproach himself for what he had done: he did not appreciate what madness of pride had made him refuse to live his friendship. But he heard someone running behind him and presently Lawson's voice calling him; Philip got his way and suddenly the feeling of hostility got the better of him; he presented to Lawson a cold, set -back. "What is it?" "I suppose you heard about Hayward, didn't you?" "I know he went to the Cape." "He died, you know, after the fire." In the moment Philip did it. He could hardly resist his ears. "How?" he asked . "Oh, great luck, wasn't it? I thought you could! Gave me a little bit to take a turn when I heard this!" He nodded quickly and walked away. Philip felt a shiver pass through his mouth and breath. He had never noticed a single man at his own age, for the death of a man much older than himself, had seemed to come in the midst of a shock. The heartbeat became a peculiar shock. It reminded him of his mortality, for like everyone else Philip, knowing perfectly that all men must be together, had the intimate feeling that the same must apply to himself; and , though he had long ceased to have any relationship for him, affected him deeply. He remembered on a sudden all the good talks they had had, and it was a pleasure to think that they would never talk with him again; they had also known what might have happened. They had had many memorable moments together, including their first meeting and the pleasant months they had spent together in Heidelberg. He sank as he listened to the conversations, including the lost years. He walked on to the home from noticing where he went, and realised suddenly, with a bit of irritation, that by passing down the Haymarket he had sauntered along Shaftesbury
