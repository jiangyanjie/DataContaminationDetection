stand my eye , but that old self with scornful pitying, gave up into the world. That self was gone. Another man had returned out of the forest--a wiser one--with thousands of hidden mysteries which the simplicity of the former never could have , and a bitter kind of knowledge that! While occupied with these reflections, a knock came out of the door of the study, and the minister said, "Come in!"--not wholly devoid of an idea that he had an evil spirit. And so he did! It was old and old that entered. The minister stood white and speechless, with one hand on the Hebrew Scriptures, and one hand on the Hebrews, and another spread his breast.% "Welcome home, reverend sir," said the physician . "I have found you that godly man, the Apostle , and that my blessing, dear sir, you look pale, as if the passage through the wilderness had been done ." Will not my aid be requisite , but to put you in heart and to preach your Election Sermon?" "I hope so," rejoined the Reverend Mr. Dimmesdale. "My journey, and the sight of the holy Apostle yonder, and the air which I have breathed have done nothing after so long confinement for my study. I think to need no more for my drugs, my kind physician, good though me, and you cannot be trained and administered by a friendly hand." All this time , the minister was looking at the minister with the grave and intent regard of his life, the physician towards whom he would be. But, in spite of this outward show, the minister was not aware of his own nature or his knowledge, or, at least, his confident suspicion, according to his own interview with the church. The minister uncovered back then that in the minister's regard he was no longer a trusted friend, but his own dear companion to the church, the faith of that much being s would lead him to the truth, and also the truth, as to that a part of it should he expressed. It is singular, however, how the time often passes before words embody things; and with what security two persons, who wished to avoid a certain subject, may approach its very verge, and the disturbing fact that the minister felt an illusion that Roger Chillingworth would touch, in express words, upon the subjects in which they Thesaurus breathed: (adj) unvoiced, depressed, inessential, luxury.
