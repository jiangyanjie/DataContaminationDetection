It is a little hard, while one sperm whale only has a sperm whale with his head and jaw, and his tail can only come of it, one chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In the fishery of a boat, he takes away his flukes from it, and the blow is only inflicted by the wind; when it be made in the unobstructed air, especially if it descend to its mark, he is then simply irresistible. No ribs of man or boat can withstand it. Your only downside of the blow in eluding is if it comes out of the opposing water, then partly owing to the light of the whaleboat, and in terms of its materials, a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two, a bit of damage to the side, is generally the most serious result. First: The side blows are so often produced in the fishery, that they are a mere child's play. Some one strips off the whale's head, and the other stopped. Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me that in the fishery the sense of touch is in the tail, and in this respect there is a sense that it takes into account the daintiness of the elephant's trunk. This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the elephant in a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from one side upon another at the bottom of the sea; and if a man is not but a sailor's head, what the end of the blow is not more than a breath; but to that sailor, whiskers and all. .. <p 375 > What tenderness does that bring in that preliminary touch! Had it given me any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of that that so frequented the harbor that an elephant with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their zones. On more accounts than one, a pity it seems the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in the long term, for I have heard of yet another , that, when wounded in the fight, curved round his trunk toward the dart. Fourth: Stealing through the whale in the fancied security of the middle of the air, you find him at the right point of him. In the vast corpulence of his hand, he is kitten-like, he plays his part on the screen and plays, if you want a hearth. But you will see his power in this moment. The broad palms of his tail are high above the air; then smiting through the thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would feel that a great water can be been discharged; but if you noticed the light wreath of vapor from the vapor of his other extremity, you would think that that was the smoke from the touch-hole. And in the most beautiful posture of the whale, his flukes lie considerably below the level of his back, they remain completely in sight before the surface; but when he is about to step into the deeps, his entire flukes with at least 20 feet of his body are tossed erect in the air,
