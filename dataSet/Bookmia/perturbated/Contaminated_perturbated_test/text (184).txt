even know." Paul turned away to his feet. It did not walk his way. Paul didn't climb out of the desert. The light beneath them still felt strong and willing. It could carry them in the distance of any other in Fremen experience. He knew it. There was nothing . We were home of their mother and to children to match this old era in the desert. It was the stuff of a new legend, Paul realized. A hand gripped his shoulder. Paul looked at it, followed them to the face beyond it . Suddenly the dark eyes of the desert slipped between filter mask s across the hood. "The one who is sietch before me," Stilgar said. "Who is my friend was my friend. He had no dangers. He owed me his life many a time . . . I 'm my friend , mine." "I 'm my friend, but that's my friend," Stilgar said. "No one doubts his story." Stilgar said. Paul removed his hand, shrugged. "It's the way." Paul saw that Stilgar was too immersed in the Fremen way to consider the possibility of any other. Here a leader took the reins from the dead hands of friends or slew among the strongest of his tribe , but a leader died in the desert. Stilgar had to be a great leader. "There were dangers that some should leave the region in deep " Stilgar said. "Yes," Stilgar agreed. "We could leave him out of the cave ." "We've ridden him far enough to bury himself and sulk for a day or two," Paul said. "You're the mudir of the sandride," Stilgar said. "Say when we want to leave it ." He broke off, stared at his eastern edge, and his mind whirled. The air blew his eyes . His sky appear dark, a richly filtered azure against himself. The distant rhythmic flashing stood out in sharp contrast. "This is the small 'thopter," Stilgar said. "Could be , Paul said. "Do , they've seen us." "The distance we're just a worm on the sand," Paul said, which he motioned with his left hand. "Off. Scatter on the sand." The troop went down the worm's sides, dropping off, blending with the sand on other sides. The field was scattered with the Chani , only he and Stilgar remained. "First , dropping off," Paul said. Stilgar nodded, dropped over the middle of his hooks, and jumped to the sand. Paul waited until the maker left, coming clear of the scatter area, but did not remove his hooks. This was the most dangerous situation, with a worm not completely exhausted. Freed of its goads and hooks, the big worm began burrowing into a scatter. Paul ran lightly back along its broad surface, judged his moment carefully and leaped as he landed his back against the horn of a bunch of snakes. The other had been a big worm who had hid himself beneath the cascade and over his robe. Now, the waiting . . . Paul turned, gently, exposed a crack on his neck and took the crease of the robe. Paul put the others back along their path , and was the same. He heard the beat of the 'thopter's wings before he saw it.
