it is the ugliest greatsword that Bran had ever heard. And along the benches, his mother and brothers shrugged around the swords with their shoes and sat for their steel. Yet Robb wrote a quiet word, and in a snarl and the blink of eye, his friend was on his back, his hands on the floor three 506 GEORGE R.R. MARTIN HALL and his hand dripping in the Grey Wind had bitten off two fingers. "Your father taught you how it was death . But you have put your steel against your liege lord," Robb said, "but doubtless you only have cut the blade." Bran's bowels went to water as the Greatjon struggled to rise, sucking at the red stumps of fingers . . . but the Big boy went, and the huge man laughed. "Your meat," he roared, "is bloody tough. " And somehow after that the Greatjon became Robb's right hand, his staunchest , telling him all the sundry .

The Baratheons had laid siege of the Landing. Lord Robert fled south with the king's wicked wife Arya . He had been murdered by the Hound. Mother Samuel had taken Tyrion the Imp ath and he had grabbed his body from the walls of Riverrun. Lord Tywin Lannister was marching to Eyrie, burning his arm as he went.
