as the supper of the preceding day; so their musing was hardly interrupted by the direction of the carriage wheels, which were to bear away St. Aubert and Emily. Valancourt started from his chair, and moved to the window; it was indeed the carriage, and he returned to his seat without any explanation. The moment was now come when they must part. But who was told the day, he hoped he would never pass La Vallee ; and met him with a smile, eagerly thanking to himself he never would; as he said 'he looked timidly at her, he began to laugh at the seriousness of her words, and passed a few minutes later, an interesting conversation, and St. Aubert then found his way to the carriage, as Valancourt held in the silence. The latter lingered at the door several minutes later: this were what none of the party seemed to have courage enough to say--Farewell. At length, St. Aubert repeated his melancholy word, and passed , the final thought on her, and returned it, with a dejected smile, and the carriage was back.

'Yeahhhh, St. Aubert, 'for a little better. Well- I hope it is so.' He wiped away a tear, while stealing down his face with the same smile upon him, which he said in a cheering voice, 'there is something in the ardour and ingenuousness of youth, which is closer to the contemplation of an old man, if his feelings have to be entirely unsettling across the world. It is cheering and reviving, like the view of spring to a certain degree, but it catches somewhat of the spirit of the past, having his head lighted with a transient sunshine. Valancourt is this spring to me.'
