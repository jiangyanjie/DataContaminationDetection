Buck's voice did not come to join. From the borealis flaming coldly overhead, the red stars roaring below the frost dance, and the land being frozen under its pall of snow, this song of what might have been the defiance of life, only being pitched in one of these songs with long- drawn wailings and half-sobs, and with the pleading of the articulate travail of existence. It was an ancient song of as old as the breed itself--one of the songs of the younger world in a day when songs were sad. It was with the woe of unnumbered generations, this plaint by which Buck 's silence was strangely stirred. When Buck moaned and sobbed, it was with the pain of the land and roof of the land that was of God, the pain of his fathers, and the fear and mercy of the cold and dark that was to them fear less. And that he should have died by it marked the completeness with which he harked back into their ages of ashes, from the land and roof to the raw beginnings of life in his ages. Seven days from the time of the first day, Buck walked into Dawson, stopping down the steep bank by the west of the Yukon Trail, which it was called the Great Lakes, and the route for Dyea and Salt Water. Perrault was more, if anything more urgent than those they brought in; also, the travel pride of him, who purposed to make the record trip of the century. But the things were quite complicated and I had nothing to say in this. For the safety of the dogs and man, they made three hundred miles and the three minutes in thorough trim. The distance for dogs they had broken into the country was carried hard by later journeyers. And further, the police had arranged a stop or stop for the haul of grub for dog and man, but the man was travelling light. They made Sixty Mile, the first of them, a fifty-mile run, on the ground and the second half were on the ground. The dogs started booming up the Yukon well on their way to Pelly. But such splendid running was achieved not without great trouble and vex ation on the part of Francois. The team led by Buck , and grew through the middle of the team. It no longer was as one dog . But the kind of encouragement Buck gave a dog, they led them into all kinds of situations. No , the team turned Spitz a leader greatly to be feared. The old awe departed, and Buck, was not equal to challenging his authority. Pike robbed him of half a fish one night, and handed it down under the protection of Buck. Another night , he fought Spitz and were willing to forego the punishment they deserved. And even Billee, who was less good-natured, and whined not half as as in former days. Buck never came near the end of his day for snarling over his eyes, menacingly. In fact, his conduct approached that of a dog he was given to swaggering up the other side of the team, before Spitz's death. The breaking down of discipline likewise affected him in their relations with one another. They quarrelled and bickered more , even among themselves,
