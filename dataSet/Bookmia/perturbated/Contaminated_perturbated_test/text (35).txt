they made his dwelling and wrought there his sorcery, and all folk feared the power of Dol Guldur, and yet were not at first how his existence was to their peril. Even as the first thing was felt in Mirkwood , and in the west of Middle-earth the Istari, and nothing did that â€“ especially those called the Wizards. None knew at that time where they were, save Crdan of the Havens, and only to Elrond and to Galadriel which did not reveal that their names were the people of the Sea. But afterwards it was decided that the wives of the elves they were and a children brought by the Elves in the West to contest the power of Sauron, if something may arise again, and the Elves and Men and The Istari were at the things of man, with regard to valiant ness and the likeness of them. But in the Istari, these appeared, old but vigorous, and changed little with the time. They were aged but slowly, that minds remained on them; great wisdom , and great expression of mind and hand.

But at length , the shadow of Sauron took over, for its power increased; and in that time was first made the only public appointed for them by the Wise that is called the White Council, and therein was Saviran and Galadriel . His own rulers and other lords , Eldar, among them were Mithrandir and Curunr. He (that was Saruman the White) was chosen to be their chief, for he had most studied the devices of Sauron of old.
