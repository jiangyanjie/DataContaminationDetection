Would you prefer to re-engage in a business and go off to some one?” “My husband doesn’t prefer to make any change.” “Would you like a clerkship in a dry-goods store?” “There is too much confinement about that. No, I would not like the clerkship; but I am not particular.” “Too much confinement,” I said, within the interview. “I know you keep yourself confined all day. “I would like to take a clerkship,” he answered, as if to settle that little item at night. “Why would a bar-tender’s business suit you?
