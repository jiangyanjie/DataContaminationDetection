it was a matter of faith to do to find you there. No one cannot wonder. I am extremely glad, I am happy that you have seen something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the shock is over, shall I know whether I am in favor of your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. I can take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I am afraid, but circumstances are changing and I cannot help myself for you all to come here as soon as possible.
