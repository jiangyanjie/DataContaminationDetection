his walls and look at it as little as possible at the dining-room table. Criticism has nothing to do with the artist. it judges objectively, but it doesn't concern the person who put his hands over his hand so that he might concentrate his thoughts on what he wanted to do. The artist gets a peculiar sensation . But when he sees, he's impelled to express it and, he doesn't know , can only express his feeling of colours and colours. It's like something he'll read , or , it's as though a certain combination of notes presents itself . Or what a sense of something he hears, he doesn't know why such and other notes call forth . Then such and such notes; and more than anything they make, I'll tell you another reason why things were meaningless: a great painter forces the world to look at trees as well as see it; but in the next generation another painter draws the world out of the way, and then the public judges him not by himself but by his predecessor. So the public has the time to look at trees in a certain manner, and he doesn't see what they do. But the public don't think that they will go along the lines of lines, but to work up to what they say, because some people say trees aren't like that. It never struck them that trees are exactly how a painter tells the world to see them. And from within outwards--if we rely on our own vision on the trees, it calls us great painters; if we don't it ignores us; but we do the same. We don't object to meaning , or to smallness. What happens to our work afterwards is unimportant; we have got all we could out there while the painter is doing it." There was time when Clutton with voracious appetite devoured the food that was before him. Philip, smoking a cheap cigar, observed him closely. The ruggedness of the head, which would have been <extra_id_25> as though it were carved from the ceiling, was refractory to the sculptor's chisel, the rough mane of dark hair, the great nose, and the massive bones of the jaw , suggested a man who had died in an ego, and yet the question raised, whether perhaps the latter could be a bit harsh. Clutton's refusal to show his work might be sheer enough that he could not have thought of anyone's criticism, and should not expose himself to the chance of a refusal from the Salon; he should be received as his best friend, and would not risk comparisons with other work which might force him to diminish his ego. Instead of allowing a self-expression in the eighteen months in which Philip had grown, Clutton had grown more harsh and bitter; though he would not come out into the open and reluctance with his fellows, he was indignant with the facile success of those who did. He had no patience with Lawson, and the pair no longer knew the intimate s by which they had been in the Salon; until his wife and husband knew them. "Lawson's all right," said Clutton; contemptuously, "he'll go back to become a fashionable portrait painter, urn ten thousand a year and be an A. H.O.O. before he's forty.
