I am very tired of a farm, so I shall go to my funny bed of grasses which Mr. Philander offered for me, but will add to this from day to day . I can never help it . JANE PORTER. TO HAZEL STRONG, BALTIMORE, COCK. He sat in a room for a long time before he was reading the letter. It was filled with all kinds of uplifting , things that his brain was trying to whirl as he attempted to digest . When they did it, that was the signature of Tarzan of the Apes. He would tell them. In his case, Clayton had constructed a shelter of leaves and boughs, beneath which, protected with rain, he had placed the few treasures brought from him.
