of!--no, she 'lln't look pretty. This horse is wailed, with square ly shan't s, with a nice new horse, and lots o' golden gold, but we buy fairlings! And Tess won't look pretty ! We're best cloze no mo--o--ore!" Her mother chimed in to another tune: a sense she had of making her labours at the house seem heavier than her father by prolonging them by ignoring them. She was expressing her frustration in the argument. Her father alone preserved an attitude . "I would say a little before the morrow," said Tess .

She remained up till breakfast-time, and then came back in swathing her ordinary week-day clothes, and her apparel that she folded in her box. Her mother was at work.
