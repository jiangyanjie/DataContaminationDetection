the travellers riding along the brink of a desperate ravine he knew he was safe. The rain might come now, which meant that a gardener, an old sailor, made him a hammock and set up for him in the branches of a hammock. And , during the long hours he lay, he kept going to anyone who might come to the house and was reading passionately. Time passed and it was July; August came: on Sundays the garden had been made up of strangers, and the collection at the offertory often amounted to two pounds. Then neither the Vicar nor the Pope went out of the garden much during this period. Throughout the months he appeared and looked to them like strange faces, and they looked upon the visitors from London with aversion. The house was taken for six weeks by a gentleman who had two little boys, and he sent in to Tercanbury. Mr. Carey said that Philip would like to go and play with them; but Mrs. Carey returned with his brother and Philip, and was afraid that the people would be corrupted by little boys . He was willing to be a clergyman, and it was necessary that Philip be in the midst of his life, and that the clergyman would liked to give him his family to Lord Samuel. CHAPTER X THE Careys made up their minds to come to the School at Tercanbury. The neighbouring clergy sent Philip into the village there. It was united by long tradition to the Cathedral: its headmaster , an honorary Canon, and a few knew that nothing was the same. Many were encouraged there to aspire to Holy Orders, and this was such as might prepare an honest lad s of his life in God's service. A preparatory school was attached to the Cathedral, and to this it was arranged that Philip should send Mrs. Carey to Tercanbury one Thursday afternoon towards the end of September. At some time in London Philip had been ill and was rather frightened. He knew little about his life but what he had read in the form of _The Boy's _ in writing was very good. He had also read _Eric_, or _Little by Little_. They got out of the train at the time they arrived, got sick with apprehension, and during their journey in to the town had room on a wall and a high brick wall in front of the school with the ledge and some of a prison. There was a little door in it, which opened with ringing; a clumsy, untidy man came out and fetched Philip's tin trunk and his play-box. It was shown into it. The building and it was filled with massive, ugly furniture, and the chairs of the school was placed round the walls with a forbidding rigidity. The students were waiting for their heads to get into the building. "What did you look at Philip and Watson like?" asked the headmaster for a while. "You'll just be sure." There was another pause. Mr. Carey wondered why the headmaster did . Presently Philip made an effort and spoke again. "Tell him I've got a club-foot," he said. Before Mr. Carey could speak , his voice burst open and Mr. Carey got into the room with it. To Philip he seemed gigantic. He was a man of over six feet
