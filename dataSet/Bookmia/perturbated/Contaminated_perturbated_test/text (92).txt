this death to a former one, which was attended with such disastrous consequences to Clifford they would have had nothing but of removing them from the scene. But this death is extremely unfortunate! Had Hepzibah but somehow known that Clifford flung wide the door, and proclaimed Judge Pyncheon's death,--it would have been, however awful ly, the event fruitful of good consequences to his uncle. If someone had tried to view it, it would have gone on, obliterating the black stain of his character." "And how" said Phoebe, "could someone distinguish from what a misunderstanding is very dreadful?" "Because," said the artist, "if the cause could be fairly so candidly interpreted, it must be evident that Judge Pyncheon could have come unfairly to his end. This mode of death had been regarded as an idiosyncrasy for his family, for generations past; not in this sense, but when it does occur, usually attacking individuals about any time of life, and generally in the tension of a power crisis, or, perhaps, in an access of wrath. Old Maule's prophecy was probably founded on the knowledge of this physical condition of the Pyncheon family. "I think there is a minute and almost exact picture of the appearances connected with the death that occurred yesterday and those related to the death of Clifford's uncle thirty years ago. It is true, there was a variety of circumstances, unnecessary to be understood. This is possible because men would have been thinking -- these things, probable, or even unexpected, had occurred and that of the day when Jaffrey Pyncheon came to a violent death, and by Clifford's hands." "Whence are these circumstances?" exclaimed Phoebe. "He was as famous as we know him to be!" "They were arranged," said Phoebe. "And such circumstances had been my conviction,--they were arranged after the uncle's death, and before it was made public, an older man who sits in yonder parlor. His own death, so like that former one, yet so bad that in the days of the Lord within a few of those suspicious circumstances, seems the ray of God upon him, at once a punishment for his death and making plain the innocence of that particular situation. But it could not be. He may have the future at hand. Could n't bring him back before the discovery of the Judge's death, the evil might be , and God must not hide this thing much longer!" "Kerdy." "It is our duty to keep it so closely in our hearts. Clifford is innocent. God will make it manifest! Let us throw open doors and call all the neighborhood you knew the thing; then you are right, Phoebe," rejoined . "You're ok, you are right." Yet the artist did not feel the horror, which turned out to be her a ast as good and order-loving character, at the moment finding herself at issue with society, and in contact with her in an event that transcended ordinary life, was he supposed, or would have been allowing, just like her, to maintain himself within the precincts of common life. On the other hand, he gathered his own enjoyment,--as it were, a mysterious and strange beauty, growing towards a desolate spot, and the wind in the sky, a flower of momentary happiness he gathered
