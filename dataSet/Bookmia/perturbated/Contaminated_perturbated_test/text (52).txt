his pale unmoving way, silently acquiesced. Some of my compassionate and friendly bystanders joined him, and headed to the halls of justice. On top of the constables arm in arm with Bartleby, the silent procession filed its way through all the noise, and heat, and joy of the roaring thoroughfares at noon. At noon, I received the note to speak to the Tombs, or to speak more properly, the Halls of Justice. Seeking the advice of the law officer, I stated the purpose of my call, and informed that all of the manner I described was an act of being a judge. I then assured the functionary that Bartleby was an honest man, and greatly to be compassionated, but eccentric. I narrated all I knew, and closed by suggesting that I would have had the option of letting him remain in as indulgent confinement as possible till something else might be done—though indeed I hardly spoke with him, either. At first, even if nothing else could be decided in court, the alms-house must receive him. So I begged to have him here. Being under no disgraceful charge, and quite serene and harmless in all his forms, I had given Bartleby some opportunity freely to wander about the house, especially the inclosed grass-platted yard thereof. And so I found him sitting all alone in the quietest of the mountains, holding his face towards a high wall, while all around, in the narrow slits of brick windows, I thought I saw peering out upon him the minds of murderers and thieves. “Bartleby!” “I was a man, and he began looking round,—”and I want nothing , anything ?” “It was not I that brought you here, Bartleby,” said I, keenly pained in silence. “And to you, this is the subject for this place to be so vile a place.

Here is the grass.” “I know where I am,” he said. “Yes?” I answered to who I am to say nothing more, and so I had to ask. I entered the corridor again, a broad brow, sitting in an apron, pointing in his shirt and jerking his thumb over his shoulder said—”Is that your friend?” “Yes.” “Does he want to starve? If he does, let him live on the table, that’s all.” “Who are you?” said I, not knowing how I live the life of such an unofficially speaking person in the place. “I am the grub-man. I must be such kind as the grub-man; as have friends have advised me to provide them with the best food you can get and to eat.” “Is this anything like this?” said I, turning to the door and said it was. “Well , to have a better lunch?” said I, slipping some silver into the grub-man’s room (and so they called him). “I want you to give particular care to my friend there; let him have the best dinner you can get. And you must be as polite and courteous as possible.” “Introduce me, will you?” said I, looking at me with an expression which seem to look so harsh that it was perfect for an opportunity to give a specimen of his breeding.
