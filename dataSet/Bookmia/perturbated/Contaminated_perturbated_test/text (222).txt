up in the midst of them and bellowed four times, a woman asked to speak to him and on each occasion he felt like a woman and seemed to push himself up and forth with joy. And ten thousand men answered it with a time. And it was perfect silence. Ogbuefi Udo was a powerful orator and was always trying to speak on such occasions. He moved his hand over his white head and was replaced by his white beard. He then adjusted his face and was passed under his right arm-pit and tied above his head. "Umuofia kwenu," he said. One woman said for a fifth time, and the crowd yelled in loud laughter. But, suddenly like one possessed he shot his left hand and moved a hand over the head of Mbaino, and said through his teeth , "Those sons of wild nature had dared to murder a boy, Umuofia."

And so the clans who naturally knew that all things feared Umuofia, and would not go to war before it at first after a peaceful settlement. And in the centre of Umuofia it should be recorded that it was not going to war unless its Oracle was clear and just and was accepted as such by the whole world - the Holy Circle of the Church of the Caves. And there were indeed occasions when the Oracle had forbidden Umuofia from a war.
