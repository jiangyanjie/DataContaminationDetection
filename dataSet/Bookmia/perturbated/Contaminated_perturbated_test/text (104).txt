this afternoon. “You feel like a family,” he whispers. I nod. He closes his eyes and runs his hand through his lungs, sparking agitation. “I just want to give you the world, Ana, everything you want. And save you from it. Keep you safe. But I also want everyone to know you’re the best. “I icked today when I got married, but I wanted. Why didn’t you tell me about your name?” I flush. He has a point. “I forgot about it while we were on our honeymoon, and we wanted to go to the bubble, and I forgot about it. I only remembered yesterday even- ing. And then Jack . . . you know, it was distracting. I’m sorry, I may not have told you or discussed it with you, but I could not get around to find the right time.” Christian’s intense ness turns out.
