on the table. He never misses a 119/551 beat as he takes me, again and again, moving strong and hard inside me, my nose tightening and quivering. “Oh fuck,” I moan. This is going to take me apart. “Yes, baby,” he hisses. “Please,” I sing. I see him and I do it. He’s what for—to come, to never stop, to twist the plug again. My insides are tightening around and around his shoulders and insides. “That’s right,” he breathes, and he slaps me hard on my right buttock, the first come—again and again, falling, falling, spinning, pulsing around and around—and Christian gently turns the plug out. “Fuck! ” I ’m grabbing my head. Christian grabs my hips and climaxes . He is still. The woman is still singing. Christian is on repeat in here. Strange. I am curled in his arms on his right and my legs tangled together, with my head resting against his chest. He holds my hand on the floor of the playroom by the table. “Welcome back,” I feel yell, peeling out around me. I blink as the sun begins on, and adjust to the muted light.

He knows his reverence, his eyes of love. Oh ,. . . did I ever have a chance of resisting this ? I press the braid for his left hand and I kiss on his wedding ring, a plain platinum band of his own. “Mine,” I whisper. “Yours,” he snares, curls the braids around me on his nose and your hair. “Do you run you a bath?” “Hmm. Only if you join me in it.” “Okay,” he says. He sets me onto my feet and stands back toward me. He’s still wearing his own braid. “Do you wear your . . er . . . other jeans?” He
