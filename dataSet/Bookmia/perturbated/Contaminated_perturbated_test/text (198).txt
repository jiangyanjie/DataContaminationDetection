which it hung. His mind began to stick with the many and strange tales which he had been able to tell - with mysterious if not supernatural endowments to these mysteries - well the grandson here present as his beloved ancestors. Mr. Pyncheon, visiting abroad, and intercourse with men of their own fashion, --courtiers, worldings, and free-thinkers,--had done much towards obliterating the Puritan superstitions, which no man of New England birth at that time could entirely escape. But, on the other hand, had not a whole Community believed Maule's grandfather and his grandfather? Had not the crime been committed? Had the wizard been buried to the fullest after eight years in it? Had he not bequeathed a grave hatred against the Pyncheons to the grandson, who, as it appeared, was now about to exercise the influence over the daughter of his enemy's father? Had not this influence be evicted from the magic that was called witchcraft? When Alice went around, he caught the eyes of Maule's figure in the looking-glass. At some paces from Alice, with his arms in the air, the carpenter made a gesture as he slowly pushed him downward by ponderous, and invisible weight upon the maiden.

At the thought, the ambitious father came in to the party, and since the devil's power were needed to the accomplishment of the object, Maule might heed the message. Alice's son would be her safeguard. With his stout of imaginary expression Pyncheon heard a half-uttered exclamation from his daughter. It was very faint and low; so indistinct that there seemed but half a will to shape all the words, and too much thought to the father's whole sense of truth would be intelligible. Yet it was a call for help!--his conscience could not hear it;--and, little more than a whisper , it was a shriek, and a prayer, and so, in the region round his heart! But this time the father did not turn. After a further interval, Maule spoke. "Astonished his daughter." said he. During this moment he came hastily . "A carpenter was standing erect in front of Alice's chair, taking the call and going straight towards the maiden , the bare expression of triumphant ness. The limits of which could not be defined, as, indeed, as a line, was stretched vaguely towards the devil's head. But it was too infinite. Alice sat there in an attitude of profound plight to the long
