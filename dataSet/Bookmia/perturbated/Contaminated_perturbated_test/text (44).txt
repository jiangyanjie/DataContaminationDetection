He sighs. He gets an e-mail from Detective Clark. He wants to talk to you about the Hyde.” “Really?” I sit back to gaze at Christian. “Yes. I told him that you’ve been in Portland for the last couple of years so he’ll have to wait. But he says he’d like to interview a doctor,” “He’s in Vancouver?” “Apparently so.” I feel bemused. I frown. “What’s so important that can’t wait?” “Exactly.” “When’s he coming?” “Today. I’ll e-mail him back.” “I have nothing to hide. I know what I want to do.” “We’ll find out , there’s plenty to get?” “I want to go,” he gets here. I’m intrigued, but he shifts again. “Breakfast will start shortly. Let’s eat, then we can go and see your dad.” I ask, “I want to stay there as long as you want. I can see you’re busy.” He scowls. “No, you have to come with you.” I grin, wrap my eyes around his neck and kiss . ”He is bad-tempered. It’s a little itchy, scratchy, impatient, and uncomfortable. “Dad, you’ve been in a major car accident. It will be hard to heal. Christian and I will move you to Seattle.” “I don’t know why you are in Seattle, but it’s with me.

We’ll go .” “Great!” “You want some decent coffee, too?” “Hell yeah!” “Okay, I’ll go get some.” 385/551 Christian is once more in the waiting room, talking on the phone. I think Christian can’t set up this here. Weirdly, he’s by himself, although the other ICU offices are occupied. I wonder if Christian’s frightened off the other visitors. It might have a good Friday, and he’s too tired. “He will be here at four this afternoon.” I frown. What could be so urgent? “He wants coffee and doughnuts.” He says, “I know I would too if I’d been in an accident. Ask Taylor . “No, don’t. “Take Taylor with me.” His voice is not as soft as I roll my hands. Next he glares. Then he smirks and cocks his head to one side. “No one here.” His voice is deliciously low, and I know he’s threaten- ing to spank me. I am trying to dare him, when a young couple enters in the office. She is afraid. I shrug apologetically at Christian, and he nods. He picks up , takes my hand, and leads me out of their office. “They ’re in privacy more than they do,” Christian murmurs. “We’ll have our fun later.” Outside Taylor stares patiently. “Let’s all go get coffee and doughnuts.” Christian walks out at approximately 12 o’clock precisely . I knock on his door. Taylor ushers in to an anonymous comment. He looks more bad-tempered than usual. He seems to be the most bad-tempered. Perhaps it’s the way his face is .
