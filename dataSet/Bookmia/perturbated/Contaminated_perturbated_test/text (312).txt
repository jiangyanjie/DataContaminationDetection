of all those who shall yet be born, all the sons and daughters of Adam, all are assembled on each day. Thus, the supreme judge is coming! No longer the lowly Lamb of God, no longer the meek Jesus of Nazareth, no longer the prophet Sorrows, no longer the Good . God is seen now coming upon the land of the great power , attended by the bodies of angels, angels and archangels, principalities, powers and virtues, thrones of angels, cherubim and seraphim, God Omnipotent, God Everlasting. He speaks: and is uttered: he is heard even at the farthest limits of space, even In the bottomless abyss. Supreme Judge, from His experience, will be and can be said. He is just on the wrong side, and will enter into the eternal sands, to each and every bliss prepared for them. The unjust He casts from Him, crying in his majesty: DEPART ABLE IS CURSED, INTO THE GOD, AND MANY OF WHICH WAS PREPARED OUT OF DEVIL AND HIS MEED! A great thing in the same agony then for the miserable sinners! Friend is torn apart from all the wonderful sands: they are the brothers of their wives and wives. The poor of God is sent out his arms to those who were dear ly, to those who lost their dignity in this earthly world, to those whose simple piety perhaps he made a certain difference and who loved him, to those who counselled him , to those who were men willing to lead him on the right path, to a kind man, a loving father to the good father who loved him so dearly.

And this year come, shall come, must come: the day of death and of death . It is appointed unto man to die and after death the judgement. Death is one that results in a bad event, when it are uncertain, due to a long disease or from some unexpected accident: the Son of God cometh at an hour when God is free to expect Him. Youâ€™re ready every moment, seeing that you may die at any moment. Death is the defining thing for all. Death and the portals that are connected into the world by the eyes of our first parents, the dark portals that close our earthly existence, the portals that open all our hearts and the unseen, portals that are centered around our first parents, and every day that we pass, alone, unaided save by its good works, without friend less parent , to help it, alone and trembling. Let that thought be in our minds and then we will understand. Death, from a world of terror to the last day, is a blessed moment , to those who has walked in the right path, fulfilling the duties of his station in the desert and, to his morning and evening prayers,
