marriage to Magdalene." "No, no," Teabing said, going across a nearby table of books. "As I said , the marriage of Jesus and Mary Magdalene was the first of the record." Quite frankly, the authors stopped pawing through the bible's contents. "Moreover, Jesus as a married man makes more sense than our standard biblical view of Jesus as a bachelor." "Why?" she said. "Because Jesus was a Jew," Langdon said, taking a look at this table, searching for his book, "and it's the decorum that one at a time virtually forbid a Jewish man from living unmarried. According to a Bible study, their celibacy was condemned, and the obligation for a Jewish father was to find a suitable wife and son. If Jesus were married at least any of the Bible's gospels would have mentioned it and offered some insight into the unnatural state of bachelorhood." Teabing located a huge book and pulled it toward him across the table. The original edition was poster-sized, like a huge atlas. The authors of the book also recalled the Gnostic Gospels. Teabing heaved it open, and Langdon and Sophie joined in. As you could see it contained illustrations of what might be magnified passages of ancient biblical writing with handwritten text. She did not recall referring to all of the ancient Bible records, and the verse bore typed translations. "These are photocopies of the King and Dead Sea ," I mentioned earlier," Teabing said. "The earliest text is a Bible study. These do not match up with the gospels in the Bible." Flipping the middle of the page, Teabing noted the text in a passage. "The Gospel of Philip is a good place to read the passage," Teabing said. "I read the passage: And the youngest of the Saviour is Mary Magdalene. Christ loved her more than all other disciples and used to kiss her often on her tongue. The rest of the disciples were offended , and expressed disapproval. They said to him, " "Who would love her ? What would she love all of us?" The words were very simple, and they hardly seemed conclusive. "It says nothing of marriage." "Au contraire." Teabing responded to the first line. "The Aramaic scholar will not see the book, in those senses, but they had meant spouse." Langdon read a second line as she read the first novel. And the companion of the Saviour was the Magdalene. Teabing flipped through the book and pointed to the other passages that, to Sophie's surprise, clearly meant married and a true marriage. She was living in a romantic relationship. As she read the passages, Sophie asked the angry priest who had flipped through her grandfather's door when she was a schoolgirl. "Is this the home of Jacques ?" the priest had demanded, glaring down at her when she pulled on the door. "I want to talk to him about the editorial he wrote." The priest held up a newspaper. Sophie summoned her brother as if the priest had disappeared into his study and closed the door. My grandfather wrote the article, why were they going to read the paper? Sophie immediately ran to the kitchen and flipped through that morning's paper. She found her grandfather's name 166 on
