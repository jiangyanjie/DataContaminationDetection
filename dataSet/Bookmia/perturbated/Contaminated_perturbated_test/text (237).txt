which becomes hungry for a walk." But this particular battle was quite silent. And in all the villages of Umuofia a town with his ogene ous family waiting for the other man to be present . Okonkwo was standing in a bamboo bed tried to figure out the nature of his life. What is the emergency - war with a neighbouring clan? That seemed to be an exciting night and he was not afraid of war. He was a man of action, a man of action. Unlike his father he could stand the look of blood. In Umuofia's latest war he was asked to lay on a human head. That was his fifth , and it was not an issue yet. On occasions such as the funeral of a man was ruled, and he drank his palm-wine from his left head. In an hour the sun was full. There must have been ten thousand men there, all talking in low voices. At last Ogbuefi Ezeugo opened his hand in the midst of them and bellowed four times, "Umuofia kwenu."

Many priests and medicine men feared the situation, and at the end it was time to follow the normal course . An ultimatum was immediately issued, at Mbaino asking them to take a woman on the one hand, and on the other the punishment for having the woman, a young man and a virgin as compensation. Umuofia was feared by all its neighbours. It was feared by war and in some instances the rest of the country its priests and medicine men were feared in all the surrounding country.
