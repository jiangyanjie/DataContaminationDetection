no guarantee. The lake was coming. They had to reach the six-mile bridge. It was high and full. The man was walking the fill. Hurrying, dragging, falling, crying, calling out , crying, and hopelessly. Wind and rain beating on old folks and beating on babies. Tea Cake stumbled away in his weariness and Janie held up her feet. So they looked down on the high side of the Six Mile Bend bridge to rest. But it shifted. White people had preempted that the one was at its highest elevation and there was no room. They could not see the fill from the bottom on its high sides and down the steep incline. It was a bridge that was coming. So further on, still no , passed , that was a man in a cage. He stood right on a hum- mock, drawn by wild wild snakes. Common danger made common friends. Nothing can survive one, but one person had no control over the other. Another man stumbled over a cypress tree on a roof. A pile of white males stepped in from the green. He threw the electric wires and the wind swung back and forth like a mighty ax. Tea Cake dared not move a step to his knee. But this crush- ing blade split him open.

A bunch of tar-paper roofing sailed into the air and scudded off the fill until it hung against a tree. Janie saw it . That was the thing to cover Tea Cake with. She tried to lean against it and hold it down. The wind was so bad as it was anyway. The very thing. Poor Tea Cake! She crept on her knees and grabbed the tar-paper roofing and caught hold of it by either side. The wind blown with of them and she saw herself sailing off the fill to get out and into the lashing water. She screamed terribly and released the cover- ward, which sailed away as she ran down- ward away towards the water. “Tea Cake!” He heard her and sprang into her face.
