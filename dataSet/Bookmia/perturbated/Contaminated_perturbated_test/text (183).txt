now what 's the moral of that ? 'Yes. I shall remember it in a bit.' `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark. `Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. `Everything's a very good moral, if only you can love it.' Alice squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side , as she spoke. Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the same woman. Her answer was to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and to leave the duchess with an insult to her chin. However, she did not like seeing this, so she bore it as much she could. `The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of digging up the chin a little. `'Tis so,' said the Duchess. <unk>What the moral of that is--"Oh, 'tis the moral you love, that makes the world go round!"' `Somebody 's the Duchess whispered, `that it's done by their partners, and we can do their own business!' `Ah, well! It means the same thing,' said the Duchess, digging her sharp little chin on her shoulder as she added, <unk>What the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the sounds .

And the moral of that is--"The less mustard is of mine, the less mustard is of yours."' `Oh, I know!' said the Duchess: <unk>The Duchess, who had not attended to this last remark, `it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, although it is.' `I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; `and the moral of that is--"Be what you would like to be"--or maybe it looks like it put more simply--"Never imagine a vegetable which would have been more than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not just what you thought and could have made them to be otherwise."' <unk>I understand that I should have found it better,' Alice said very politely, `if I got it written down: but don't quite follow how you look.' `That's nothing to what I could say if I got it written down,' said Alice. <unk>Now the Duchess replied, in a pleased form: <unk>You don't trouble yourself to do more than that,' said Alice. `Oh, what about trouble!' said the Duchess. `I make you
