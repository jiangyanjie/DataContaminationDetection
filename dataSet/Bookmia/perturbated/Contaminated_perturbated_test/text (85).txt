has produced outstanding witches in our world. While you are at Hogwarts, you will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose the entire year. At the end of the year, the house that received most points is awarded the house cup, in honor. I hope that you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours. "The House Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of all of the school. I suggest you all keep going. You'll end up as good as you can while you are waiting." Harry lingered for a moment on Neville's cloak, which sits on his left ear, and on Ron's right ear, while Harry nervously tried to see this in hair. "I shall return when we are standing by you," said Professor McGonagall. "Please wait quietly." She left the room crying, Ron swallowed. "How exactly do they sort us into houses?" he asked Ron. "Some sort of test, I think. Fred eric hurts a lot, I think I was joking." Harry's voice was very fast. "I would call it a jolt. A test? In front of the whole school? But he never know any magic yet -- what on earth could he have said if I hadn't been there? He hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived. He was speaking with Mr. Antoine anxiously and saw that Harry looked terrified, too. No one could say much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells . He was wondering which one she'd need. He thought it would be hard not to listen to her. He'd never been there, never, not to panic. His eyes grew like he'd had to take a school report to the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any guy looking at Mr. Marquard he would come to lead him at his teen doom. Then something was made the kids smile. Harry was so concerned that it looked like they were arguing about a foot with the air -- several people heard him scream ed. "What the hell. He gasped. So did the people around this room. The twenty ghosts had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly transparent, they entered the room, standing closer to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. "Now, it was going like a question. It was a bit of a question to ask and forget, I say, we ought to give you the second chance -- " "My dear friend, if we given Peeves all the chances he has? Give us all a bad name and you 're not really even a ghost -- " "Who is your father, what are you all doing here?" There was a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the people inside the door. Nobody answered. "New students!" said Fat Friar, smiling around at them. "About this house. Sorted, I suppose?" The people was open to resign. "Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!" said the woman. "Seen up in your old house, you know." "Move along now," said a sharp voice. "The Ceremony's about to get back into the house." When Professor McGonagall had sat one by one, the ghosts floated through the opposite wall.
