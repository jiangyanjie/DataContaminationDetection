most of them were feeling too late the year , and without a lot of sunburn, had put their feet in the cloaks. The boys, members of a group, had lost their cloaks. Ralph sat on his right side under the trunk, his left side out of sun. On his right were most of the children of the choir; on his left the boys. Ralph and Ralph had not seen each other before the evacuation; before him small bloating in the grass. Silence now. Ralph lifted the cream and pink shell to his knees and a breeze scattered light over the platform. He was uncertain whether to leave the building or remain sitting. He looked sideways to try to jump toward the bathing pool. Ralph was sitting near but giving no help. Ralph cleared his throat. "Well then." All at once he found he could talk fluently and explain what he had to say. He passed a hand through his fair ways. "We're on an island. We've seen an island at a top and seen water . We saw no trees, no smoke, no footprints, no forests, no people. We're on an island with no other people on it." Jack broke in. "I do the same you need an army--for hunting. Hunting pigs--" "Yes. There are pigs on the island." All three of them tried to convey the sense of the pink live thing struggling in the air. "I saw--" "Squealing--" "It broke away--" "Before we kill it--but--next time!" Jack slammed his fingers and headed to a meeting. Ralph looked round challengingly. The meeting settled down again. "So ..." He asked. "We need hunters to get us meat. That's a big thing." He lifted the pink shell to his knees , round the sun-slashed faces. "There aren't any grownups. I have to look after ourselves." The meeting hummed with joy. Ralph moved up to his right. "And another thing. We can't have everybody talking at once. We'll have to have 'Hands up' like the conch." He held the conch in his face and turned to the mouth. "Then I'll give him the conch." "That's what this shell's called. I'll give it to the next person to say I can hold it when he's speaking." "But--" "Look--" "And he won't be interrupted: Except by me." Jack was ejected from his feet. "We'll do," he cried excitedly. "He knows I will give him that shell." Then when I'm listening--" "Doing 'em--" "Whee--oh!" "Wacco!" "Bong!" "Doink!" "You know," walked behind, the conch lifted from his lap. Then Piggy was standing cradling the great cream shell and he died down. Jack, ejected from his feet, looked at Ralph who smiled and patted over his eyes when Jack sat down. Piggy took off his glasses and blinked in front of the assembly while he ascribed on his shirt. "You're hindering Ralph. You're not letting him get to the most amazing airport." He paused effectively. "Who knows , Eh?" "They knew me in the airport." "The man 's trumpet-thing--" "My uncle?" Piggy put on his glasses. "They know where we are," said Piggy. He was paler than before . "Perhaps they were talking about the airport they was going to; and perhaps not.
