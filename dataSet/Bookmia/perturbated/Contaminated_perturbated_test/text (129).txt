She never knew that Laurence opened his door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked. She never saw Laurie mount up the hall to warn him of the silence that was going away. She never suspected that the exercise books and new songs which had been in the rack were put there for her especial benefit, and when she said to her about music , she couldn't decide how kind he was to tell him why his words helped her so much.
