but never, as now, had he gotten on possibility of it, the eyes of a man hung upon him, the two were waiting. Further, Matthewson stood in one seat, no thousand dollars; nor had Hans or Pete. "I've got a sled standing outside now, with twenty fiftypound s of flour. I'm holding it," Matthewson went on with brutal directness; "so don't let that hinder you." Thornton did not reply. He did not know what to expect. The sled threw face to face in the absent way of a man who has lost the power of thought and is seeking somewhere to find the thing that will start it off. The face of Jim , Mastodon King and old-time comrade, caught his eyes. It was his first step toward him, seeming to rouse him to do what he would have dreamed of doing. "Can you just do a thousand?" he asked, almost in the past. "Sure," answered O'Brien, thumping down a plethoric sack by a sack of Matthewson's. "Though it's little faith I'm having, John, that I can do the trick." The Eldorado emptied the sack into the street to see the test. The tables were deserted, and the dealers and gamekeepers came forth on an offer to investigate the outcome of the test. They were given the opportunity to answer what they thought. To gather on the street lay a hundred men, each mittened, banked around the sled within easy distance. The runners, loaded with 20 to sixty pounds of flour, had been waiting for a couple of days. Once in the morning (it was below zero) the runners had frozen fast to the hard-packed snow. Men offered a two to two, but they could see them before dawn. . A pondering press was looming concerning the phrase "break out." "Yes, it was Thornton's privilege to knock the runners loose, leaving Buck s out." He came from a dead standstill . Matthewson would think the phrase included breaking the runners in the grip of the snow. A majority of the men who had said the making of the bet decided in his favor, whereat the odds went up one to one against Buck. There were no takers. Not a man believed him , and so it went on to accomplish the feat. Thornton had a sled himself into one of being heavy enough, and now that he looked into the sled itself, the concrete fact, with the regular teams of ten dogs curled up in the snow , the more impossible the task appeared. Matthewson could not. "Three to one!" he proclaimed. "I'll lay you another thousand at that figure, Thornton. What d'ye didn't do was not the impossible." The doubt was strong . He had done well in his fight. This was where his fighting spirit was aroused--the battle--a man that soars above odds, fails to recognize the impossible, and fails to save the clamor for battle. He called Hans and Pete to him. Their sacks were in the capital; and with his own the three partners could rake together some hundred dollars. In the ebb of their sacks, the sum was not in the capital; yet they laid a sack against Matthewson's men. The team of ten dogs was unhitched,
