there was a passenger dropped off the carriage with a little girl. She's sitting in a chair with its hair on the shingles. I asked her to get into the ladies' waiting room, but she informed me that she preferred to stay outside. `There was no chance ," she said. She's a case, I should say." "I'm not expecting them," said Matthew blankly. "It's not the place I've come for. I would be right to come." He said he'd been here a while, where Spencer was to bring him over to Nova Scotia . The stationmaster whistled. "Guess there's no lane," he said. "She came off the train with me, and brought her into my charge. Said you and your sister were adopting her from an orphan asylum and that you would be along for her presently. I'd feel good about it-and I wouldn't want any more orphans concealed hereabouts."
