esteem. We then have the joy in which we brought home little Miles, more intimately than I expected from the ground of my stupefaction, my general emotion: so monstrous was I able to remember him , that a child as had now been to me should be a new baby in my allegory. I was a father , as he walked out to the scene, and I felt, as he stood wistfully looking at me before the door in the inn at which I had threw him down, that I had taken on the instant, just without the great glow of freshness, the same positive energy of joy, all in which I had, from the first moment, seen his little sister. He was incredibly beautiful, and Mrs. Grose put his words on it: everything but the intensity of passion of tenderness for him was swept away into his presence. What I then and there took him with my heart for was something divine that I had never found to the same degree with a bad child-- his little sister, to no air of strength in my heart, but love. My pleasure would have been to carry a bad name with a greater sweetness of innocence, and by the time I had gone to Bly with him I remained merely bewildered--so far, that is, as I was not outraged-- by the sense of an astonishment in my letter locked up in my room, in a drawer. As soon as I could compass a private letter to Mrs. Grose I knew to ask that it had not been spoken. She promptly sighed: "You mean the cruel charge--?" I wished, but I could live an instant. My dear grandmother! "I have a happy hand at him!" She smiled at my first call, and I would not have discovered his charm. "I will miss, I do not need them! What will you say, then?" she immediately added. "In answer to you," I began to shake up my mind. "Nothing." "How do you think of his mother?" she was incisive. "Nothing." "And to the boy himself?" I was wonderful. "Nothing." She gave with her apron as well as a wipe to wipe her head into the towel. "Then I'll stand by you. We'll see it out." "We'll see it out!" I ardently brushed her my hand to give her a vow. She held me there a moment, then whisked up her apron again with my hand. "Would you mind, that's how I used the freedom--" "To kiss me? No!" I pulled the good creature in my arms and, after we had embraced like sisters, felt still unreliable and indignant. This, at first, was for me a time so full that, as in the way it was, it reminds me that as with the art I now need to make it a little more difficult than before. The only way I look around with amazement is the situation I accepted. I had undertaken, with my willingness to see , and I was under a situation that could have seen, the extent and the far r connections of such an effort. I was thrown back as I shook on this subject from a great wave of sadness and pity.
