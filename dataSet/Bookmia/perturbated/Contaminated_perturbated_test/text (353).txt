Santa has been here. Santa doesn’t do him. I know I know bad. I am glad Santa does not even have a train and flight. It flys over a helicopter and a car and a helicopter. My helicopter can fly. My helicopter is blue. It flies around the Christmas tree. He flies over the piano . The tree is in the middle of the white. It flies over the piano. It flies over Daddy and over Lelliot as he plays with the Lego. The car flies through the house, through the dining room, through the kitchen.

Monday, May 9, 2011 “Tomorrow,” I mutter, dismissing Claude Bastille, as he moves on the threshold of my office. “Golf, this week, Grey.” I hear it with easy arrogance, knowing that his experience on the outside is assured. 530/551 I hear him as he turns and leaves.

I shouldn’t feel this anymore, as I’m in anger after several years of frustration. But I do. I frown. The sobering truth is that it’s the only thing to capture as an re- mind, but I think it ’s been a privilege to fly freighters of cargo to Sudan. This re- minds me—Ros is supposed to come back to me with numbers . What the hell is keeping her? Intent on finding out what she’s playing at, I look at her and hear her in the phone. Oh, Christ! I have to endure an argument to see both Miss Anastasia Steele and Sarah Grey in the WSU student magazine. Why the fuck did I agree to this? I loathe interviews—inane questions from inane, ill-informed, vacuous women who have no problem with me. Their phone buzzes. “Yes,” I snap at Andrea Nee, wondering why she’s to blame. At least I can keep her. “Miss Anastasia Steele is here to see you, Mr. Kelly!” “I think I was expecting Katherine Kavanagh.” “It’s Miss Anastasia Steele who’s here, for a scowl.
