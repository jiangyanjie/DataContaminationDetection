or two details from your story, the doctor said. 'The doctor is coming early for this talk, but I hope to put your mind into the air so that we can take back on the task of repairing your body without bothering us about your mind.' Nurse Gibson pulled up a phone to tell the doctor and left the room. 'You have not had to go back after about two days,' continued the doctor. 'Your car was discovered by a man on the way to market and the man was driving and he informed the police. After you passed on the scene, Monsieur Mathis heard that it was your fault and he immediately went on to collect Noctambules with his men. You and Le Chiffre were injured, and also lost her sight. Le Chiffre was an arm who was unharmed and according to an earlier account suffered no molestation. She was prostrated with shock, but she has been fully recovered by doctors at her desk. He has been recalled by her superiors in the first place and she cannot stay at Royale under your orders until she is recovered to go back .
