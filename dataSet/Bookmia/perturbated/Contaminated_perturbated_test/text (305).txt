But you're wiry. I don't know but all the good ones are the best after all. If I take you you'll have to be a very good girl, you know-good and smart and respectful. I'll expect you to earn your keep, and you may know enough about that. Yes, I suppose I might prefer to take her in my hands, Miss Cuthbert. The child was fractious, and I'm clean worn out attending to him. If you don't want to take her we can take her right home now." Anna looked up and softened at sight of the child's pale face, its look of mute ly the eyes of a helpless little creature who finds itself once more caught in the trap from which he escaped. Marilla had an uncomfortable moment, and if she denied the appeal of her, it would have been on her dying day. Moreover, she did not have to, Mrs. Blewett. To hand a sensitive, "highstrung" child over to such a woman! No, she may take the responsibility of doing that! "We don't know," she said slowly.

Marilla watched a long time when he could hear that speech as if speaking aloud might shatter the glorious possibility. "Did you really say it? Or did I only imagine that ?" "I think you'd better learn to control that imagination of yours, Anne, if you were to be concerned between what is real and what isn't," said Marilla crossly. "Yes, you did hear me talk and no it isn't decided . However, perhaps we ill conclude to let Mrs. Blewett take you after all. She has seen you much more than I do." "I'd rather go back to your home than go back with her," said Anne passionately. "She looks exactly like a real woman, but not quite yet as I have smothered a smile under the conviction that Anne would be there for such a great person. "A little
