you only could I hope for succour, although no one would regret my feelings, and I felt no reason for that of hatred. Unfeeling, heartless creator! You helped me with perceptions and feelings, and you then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind. But you only had I any claim for pity and redress, and from you I determined to seek that justice which I vainly attempted to gain from any other being in the human form. "My life was a catastrophe, a disaster, and I found the sufferings I endured intense. It was in autumn when I fled from the district where I had so long resided. I travelled last night, but I felt the shock of encountering the visage s of my life.
