and wishing she was in school, I turn to my mother and grip her arm, hard. “Listen to me. Are you listening ?” She nods, alarmed by my voice. She must know what’s coming. “You can’t leave ” I say. My mother’s eyes find the floor. “I hope I won’t. I couldn’t help what—” I have to tell you this time. You can’t clock out and leave Prim to own. There’s no me now to keep you both alive. It doesn’t matter what happens. Whatever you see on the screen. You have no choice and when you come back to me you’ll take it!” My voice has risen to a shout. In front of me, my mother sees her of all the anger, the fear I felt at her abandonment. 36 She pulls her back and runs over to my grasp, but I ask the anger . “I was ill. I never could help myself if I’d had the same feeling I have now.” That part about her being ill might be very disturbing. I have seen her with all the people suffering from it . Clearly it is a sickness, but it’s one we can’t afford. “Then let me come, he’s gone. And take care for her!” I say. “I’ll look right, Katniss,” says Prim, clasping my face in the face. “But you have to do it, too. You’re so fast and brave. Maybe you can win.” I can’t win. Prim must know when she tries to win. But in her case, I have a competi- tion to it, which is far beyond my abilities. Kids from wealthier states, where winning is an honor, who’ve been trained their whole lives for this. Boys from wealthier states, where winning is three times my size. Girls from wealthier states, where there are twenty different ways to kill or kill with a knife. Oh, there’ll be people like me, too. People to weed up and let the real fun begins. “Maybe,” I say, because I can’t tell my mother and give on if I have given up myself. Besides, it isn’t in my nature to go down without a chance when you’re still insur- mountable. “Then we’d be rich as an individual. I don’t care if you get home. I just want you to come . You will get home. They’re not that rich. Really, really try?” asks Prim. “Really, really try. I don’t love it,” I say. And I know, because of Prim, I’ll have to. And then the Peacekeeper is at the mercy of you. The time is up, and we’re all hugging one another so much. But it hurts and all I’m saying is “I love you. I love you both.” And they’re say- a man, I hug it back and then the window closes and the curtain gets out and the door closes. I bury my head in one of the velvet pillows and no one can do it. And I block the whole thing . If anyone else enters the room, and when I look up, I’m sur- prised to see you baker, and then I call him his father. I can’t be- lieve he’s going to visit you one day. After all, I’ll be able to kill his son soon. My father also knows Prim because they know each other a bit, and he knows Prim even better. Prim sells her goat cheeses at
