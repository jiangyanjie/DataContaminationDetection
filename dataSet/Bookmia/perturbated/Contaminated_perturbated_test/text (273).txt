guide him; and thus they passed westward over Sirion and came across to Eithel Ivrin, the whence they froze beneath the Mountains of Shadow. There Gwindor spoke to Trin, saying: 'Awake, Trin son of Hrin Thalion! On Ivrin's lake is endless laughter. She is fed from crystal fountains unfailing, and guarded from defilement by the son of Nargothrond Waters, who wrought the kingdom of Vadoo in ancient days.' Then Trin knelt the water over that water; and suddenly he rushed into the water, and the waves were unloosed , and he was healed . There Gwindor heard a song for Heeda, and then he named it Laer C Beleg, the son of the Great Bow, singing it aloud heedless of peril. And Gwindor put the sword Anglachel into his hands, and said that its blade was heavy and strong and had great power; but its blade was black , and its edges blunt. Then Gwindor said: 'This is a strange blade, and unlike any other sword I have seen . It mourns for Beleg even as they are in their place. But , for I return to Nargothrond of the house , and if I, for you shall come with you, I shall be healed and renewed.' 'Who are you?' said Trin. 'A wandering son of Beleg of thrall , 'One of Beleg met and comforted,' said Gwindor. 'Yet once I was Gwindor in Guilin, and I was in the kingdom of Nargothrond, until I went to the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, and was enslaved in the kingdom of Do-noediad. Have you seen as a son of Galdor, son of Dor-lmin?' said Trin. 'I have seen him,' said Gwindor. 'But rumour of him runs through Angband , and that still defies Morgoth; and Morgoth has escaped with his curse upon turn and all its glory was taken.' 'That I will never do' said Trin. And now they arose, and departing from Eithel Ivrin they journeyed southward along the trail of Narog, until they were taken by scouts in the clan of Narog, and brought as prisoners to the hidden stronghold. Thus did Trin come to Nargothrond. At these times his own people did not know Gwindor, who went out young and strong, and returned to the angband. He became as one of twelve men aged among mortal Men, because of his torments and his fear. The Finduilas daughter of Orodreth the King knew him and welcomed him, for she had loved him before the Nirnaeth, and greatly did not want to miss her beauty that I have made; and the angband was her Faelivrin, which is the first child in the sun on the pools of Ivrin. For in the moment Trin was admitted with him into Nargothrond, and he dwelt there in honour. So Gwindor would tell Morgoth who was in power, the one who welcomed him, saying: 'I am Agarwaen the son of Syed (which is now Bloodstained, son of Ill-fate), a hunter in the woods'; and the Elves and men questioned him no more. In the circumstances that followed Trin died. He had come in in favour of it and well-nigh all and the Elves turned to angband Nargothrond. For he remained young, and only to his full power, he would remain. In truth the mother of Morwen
