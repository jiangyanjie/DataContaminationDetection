to do. “Where was Tea Cake’s family?” I asked people to ask. “And what did Janie’s friend Pheoby do while Janie was still missing?” I would later explore more . I pressed questions about the book in a freshman English class at Barnard College, where she had been studying in the 1920s. Hers were among the first authors in a glass case at the Barnard library , which highlighted other famous alumnae of the authors, including a poet, playwright, and singer, named Ntozake Shange. As I walked by that glass case, I felt my dream of a former author growing up into hers was attainable, partly because Zora and Ntozake were women, like me. “Zora has lived in my country,” I happily told one of my classmates, “and now I am living in hers.” I liked the fact that Zora was born in Haiti partly because of the similarities between Haitian and Southern African-American culture. Zora was an all-black town, run and run by black people, and I was from a black republic, where Frederick Douglass was an Indian nationalized English student, and where Katherine Dun- Lin is inspired and danced. In Tell My Horse, Zora finds an equivalent to the cunning Brer Rabbit of The World of Man in Haiti’s sly Ti Malis of historical lore. And in her belief that she will one day return to Ginen, Africa, she is aware of the strong convictions of many of those who were forced on sea ships for a long time, and to have no return. There were so many voices that I was talking about the conversation with people in Their Eyes Were Watching , dead-on orality in both the nar- ration and dialogue; the communal gatherings on a regular basis at different times; the intimate storytelling (krik? krak!); the communal tall-tale s about real people who have ever stepped into poverty, and fictional life, and their love story that they have hilariously blundered (blag). Her description of the burial of Janie’s pet mule reminded me of an old book that she detailed in Tell My God. I saw Haitian president Antoine tte in an elaborate story at the national Foreword xvii cathedral , tormented with her goat Simalo, something I would laugh about for years. In class at the University of Maine, I gladly raised structural questions about Their Eyes , with God. Was it a story or an adventure ? I decided it could be as interesting as many other complex novels are. Besides, don’t adventures often include romance? And aren’t some romances adven- tures? We often had no feelings for those men that concerned us as women and womanists. Was Janie Crawford a good role model or was she solely defined by the men in her life? Many of us argued that Janie did not have an ambition to be a role model at all. She did not want to be a realized and balanced character, which she was. She had a will of her own in spite of the fact that her grandmother has two first husbands to dominate her, leaving her first husband until his death with him grew unbearable, and taking off with Tea Cake
