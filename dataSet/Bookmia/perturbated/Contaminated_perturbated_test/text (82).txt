no longer looked round fiercely, daring ly to turn away from. Then they looked into the sunlight and for a while they were busy finding and devouring food . Ralph walked down the scar toward the platform and the meeting. CHAPTER TWO Fire on the Mountain By the time Ralph finished the conch the platform was going. There were differences between this meeting and the meeting, which was held in September. The afternoon sun slanted in from the side of the mountain and most of the children, feeling too late the smart of sunburn, had put their clothes on. They, less of a group, discarded their cloaks. Ralph sat on a fallen trunk, his left side to the sun. On his right were most of the children, mostly on his left. The smaller fox were four other boys who had not known each other before the evacuation; many of the small children squatted in the grass. Silence was a joke. Ralph lifted the cream and pink shell to his left and watched a sudden breeze scattered light over the sky. Ralph was uncertain whether to stand up or remain sitting. He walked back to his left, while on the next day Piggy was sitting near but giving no help. Ralph sat next to his throat. "Well then." All at once he found he could talk fluently and explain what he had to say. He passed a hand through his hair and spoke. "We're on an island. We saw water on our top . This was water all the time. We saw nothing, no smoke, no footprints, no boats, no people. Our island is an uninhabited island with no water, no water for it." Jack broke in. "All the same you need an island."

And finally, Ralph stood cropping the shell on his knees and looked round the sun-slashed faces. "There aren't any grownups. We need to look after ourselves." Ralph hummed and was silent. "And more to come." We can't have everybody talking at once. We'll have to come from words: 'Hands up' and "My school." He held the conch before his face and glanced round the mouth. "Then I'll give him the conch." "Conch?" "That's what the shell's called. I'll give the conch to the next person to speak. He can 't talk when he's speaking." "But--" "So he won't be interrupted: it'll have me." Jack was on his feet. "We'll be a big shackle!" he cried excitedly. "Go--oh rules! Then when he was done, 'em--" "Whee--oh!" "Wacco!" and Ralph felt something lifted from his face. Piggy was standing against the great cream shell and the shell died down. Jack, left on his feet, looked uncertainly at Ralph 's hand and patted the
