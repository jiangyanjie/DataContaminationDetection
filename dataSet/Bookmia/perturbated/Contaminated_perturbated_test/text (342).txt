to give orders that no one can afford to be a patient. She turned around the Beauforts to her again, and asked--when Dr. Welland went in the kitchen--What her family meant by making such a fuss about their lives. "If people older at age WILL LOVE it" s, this evening what could be better than everyone who is concerned," she said. For the doctor having opportunely modified her dietary, the stroke turned into an attack of indigestion. But he had given herself a lot of her firm tone . Welland had inherited her mother, but did not recover her former life as a whole, of her new life. The growing remoteness of old age, which had been her own, and her curiosity about others , made her never very lively . Her younger siblings became concerned about their troubles; and her family had seemed to have no difficulty in putting the Beaufort disaster out of her mind. But for the first time she became absorbed in her own life, began to take a sentimental interest in her new life, and had not been aware of several members of her family for whom she had hitherto been contemptuously indifferent. Mr. Welland, in particular, had the privilege of attracting her new family. Of her sons-in-law he was the one she was born to, and all his efforts to represent him as a man of forceful character and strength as ability (if he was "chosen") had been met with a derisive chuckle. But his eminence as a valetudinarian now made him an object of engrossing interest, and Mrs. Mingott issued his summons to him to come and compare diets as if his behaviour was perfect; for old Catherine now should not be the answer. She recognise s she could not be too careful about temperatures. Just last week after Olenska's summons a telegram announced that He would arrive from Jersey City the evening of the morning. But during 'March Wellands', where the Newland Archers chanced to be lunching, the question as to who should be eating at Jersey City was immediately raised; and the circumstances amid which the Welland household struggled as if it had been a frontier outpost, lent animation to the debate. One can be agreed that Mrs. Welland could not possibly go to Jersey City because she was to accompany her to old Catherine's house; and the broom could not be spared, since, if Mr. Welland were "upset" by seeing his mother-in-law for her day after her attack, he might have to be taken away for just a moment's time. "My Welland sons would of course be in town," Mr. Lovell Mingott would be hurrying on to his mother as the Mingott carriage engaged in him; and she would not ask May, at the end of a winter afternoon, to go on the ferry to Jersey City, even in her own way; it was inhospitable --and contrary to old Catherine's express wishes--if Madame Olenska were allowed to arrive without any other family being at the station to arrive that afternoon. The question was just like one would call it the thing her tired voice implied, to hold her family in such a dilemma. "No one would say one thing after another," the poor lady grieved, calling for the presence of her
