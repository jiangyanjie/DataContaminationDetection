calling, or in all the banisters. "Well?" she said, going into the hall. "I'm sorry I lost my temper and thrown away all things, and I'm willing to listen and tell Mrs. Lynde so." But Marilla's calm did no sign of her relief. She had been wondering what under the canopy she should do if she could not give in. "I'll shut down after milking." Accordingly, after milking, behold Marilla and Anne cross the lane, the former erect and triumphant, the latter drooping and dejected. But halfway down the hall, the words vanished as if they were not in the presence of Mrs. Lynde. She lifted her head and stepped lightly along, her eyes scathing and the sound of the sunset sky . The air of love was still vaporizing; the wind was fading, and her Marilla beheld the change disapprovingly. This was no meek penitent such as this, which behooved her to make a change in the state of the sky. "What are you thinking of, Anne?" she asked sharply. "I'm imagining out what i must say to Mrs. Lynde," answered Anne . The decision was satisfactory-or should have been so. But Marilla could not rid herself of the danger and of suffering.
