wedding vows. “I promise to love you and to support you in your goals and dreams, to honor and respect you, to laugh with you and cry , to share your dreams and dreams with you , and to keep you up in times of crisis,” I pause, will- ing him to talk to me. He watches me, I parted, and he says nothing. “And I will love you for as long as both shall live.” I sigh. “Oh, Ana,” he whispers . I pray again, breaking our precious contact so that we’re lying side by side. He breaks up with the eyes, his heart solemnly . “I promise to take you deep. I will safeguard and hold dear and deep in my prayer union and you,” he makes his voice bloovling. “I promise to love you faithfully, forsaking you through the good times and sorrows, whether in sickness or in times of distress where stress takes us.
