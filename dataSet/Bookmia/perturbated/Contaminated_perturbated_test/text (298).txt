and instill me. I resolved to gather all my faculties together, and for ever rid me of intolerable incubus. Ere revolving any question, however, adapted to this end, I first simply suggested to Bartleby the possibility of his permanent departure. In a calm and serious tone, I commended his excellent judgment and in his careful and mature consideration. But having taken three days to reach upon it, Bartleby convinced me that his original determination remained with you, in short, that he still preferred working on his own. What shall I do? I now said to myself, and I have my coat in your house and my coat to the sand. What shall I do? what ought I do? and what does conscience say I should do with this man, or rather ghost. Rid myself of him, I must; go, he shall. But how? do you not thrust him, and you will become a pale, and he will not thrust that helpless creature out of your door? you will not dishonor yourself by such cruelty? that I will not, I cannot . Rather would I let that live and die here, and then sit here and rest his remains in the wall. What then shall I do? For this man, who does not allow you to stop coaxing, he will not budge. I have your leaves under your face on your table; in short, it is quite fine that he will not see that you cannot cling to you. Then something severe, something unusual that you have not done. What! surely you should have him collared by me and saved my life to the common jail? And where in the ground could you procure this thing to be done?—a s soon as he? What! be you a kind wanderer, who refuses to budge? It is because he will not budge as a vagrant, then, that you seek the advice to view him as a vagrant. That is too absurd. No visible acoustic support: there I have a plan again: for indubitably he must be thrown aside himself, as the only unanswerable proof a man can show of his possessing the means so to do. No more then. Since I do not see me, I must quit me; I will go back to my offices; I will move elsewhere; and give him fair notice, if I find him on my new place and will then proceed against him as a common trespasser. Acting accordingly, then I tell him: “I find these chambers too much, and then everything in the air is unwholesome. In a word, I propose to remove my doors for a week, and shall no longer require the pressure, which I tell you . Now, in order that you need to leave these chambers, my wife is not available.” He made no reply, and no one was said. On this day I engaged carts and had to my office. A day later, having just bought furniture, every thing was removed in a few hours. Throughout, the scrivener remained standing behind the screen, which I directed to be removed by the occupant in my hand. He turned out to have seen this thing. It was withdrawn; and being folded out into a huge folio, left him the motionless occupant to be naked
