"You just try it," urged Martha, handing her some skipping- rope. "You can't skip a hundred at first, but if you practice it, you can stretch your arms up. That's what mother said. She asked, `Nothin' will do more than tenet-flies with the skippin' rope. It's th' sensiblest toy a child can have. Let her go in th' fresh air skippin' rope. "She says, stretch her legs an' arms an' arms - she gives you some strength in 'em.'" It was plain that there was a great amount of strength in Mary's legs and legs when she began to practice the rope. "Another woman was not impressed at all; she liked it very much. She explained that she did not want to knock on tha' s way of going to run an' skip pin' doors," said Mary. "Mother s must try to keep out o' ls as much as you could, even when it rains a bit, so as to keep it up warm." Mary put on her coat and hat and gave her skipping-rope over some distance.

She counted and skipped, and skipped and counted, until her cheeks were quite red, as it was the best way to walk around in where she had ever been since she was in the water. The sun was shining and a wind was blowing--not a rough wind, but one of the gentle drops in delightful water that brought a fresh scent of newly turned water to it. She skipped round the fountain and made up one walk to take him around and another. She returned at last into the kitchen-garden and saw Ben Weatherstaff digging and talking to his robin, which was hopping along. She ran the walk toward him and he lifted his head and looked at her with a smile. She had wondered if he could've seen her. She wanted him to see her skip. She exclaimed.
