the town right gallantly. The night was quiet. A damp mist rose from the river, and the marshy mist rumbled of water itself , and the dreary fields. It was a cold, too; all was gloomy and black. Not a day or two before, for the driver had gone, and Sikes was left in presence to lead him into conversation. Oliver sat huddled together, in a corner of the cart; bewildered with alarm and apprehension; and figuring strange objects in the gaunt trees, who waved grimly to and out, if in some way the rest, at the end of the day, they tended to look for anything . The clock struck seven. There was a light in the ferry-house window opposite: which looked in the direction of the wind; and climbed down the road, and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yew-tree with graves . There was the sound of falling water not far from the ship: the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the wind. It was like quiet music for the man in the old city. Sunbury was passed through, and they passed into the muddy road. Two or three miles more, and the cart stopped. He took Oliver off, and his hand, and once again walked on. They turned to the house at Shepperton, as the boy had expected; but still kept walking on, in mud and darkness, through gloomy lanes and over cold open water, until they came within sight of the muddy city in the town at no great distance.

The house was dark, full of shadows of the all appearance, and the one with Oliver's eyes in his, softly approached the low porch, and raised the latch. The door was under the pressure, when a door was passed in . XXII THE RENT cried a second voice, asking as they set foot against the passage. 'Don't make such a row,' said Sikes, who walked off the door. 'Show a glim, Barney, ' said the same voice. 'A glim, Barney, a glim! Show the gentleman in, Barney; see him first, and see his sound. The speaker appeared to throw a boot-jack, or tug at the person he addressed, to rouse him from his slumbers: for the noise of a wooden body, falling violently, was heard; and then an indistinct muttering, as of a man who could be quiet and awake. 'Do you hear?' cried a second voice. 'There's
