books and drawings which she found in the rack , they was there for her especial benefit, and when she had spoken to his cousin - his great music at home, she only saw how kind he was to her, and that helped too much. So she enjoyed herself . She found, what was the case, that her granted wish was good, if she hoped. Perhaps it was because she was so grateful for this blessing that a greater was given her. At any rate she said: "Mother, I'm going to work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers. He 's always been kind to me. I must thank him, and I don't know any other way.
