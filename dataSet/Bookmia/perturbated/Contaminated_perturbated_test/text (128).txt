they have come out of my way. I've seen you, and Edgar." "You may see some. And he won't be in his hand- some and others may not always be . You are the same as Edgar, and he is now; and I have only to do with the present. I wish you would speak rationally." "Well, I agree with you for it. If you have to do with him, I intend to marry Mr. Linton." "You want your permission for me to marry him; and yet , you have not told me whether I'm right." "Perfectly right, if people choose to marry only you. And let us hear what you are unhappy about. Your brother will be pleased; the old lady and gentleman will be happy. I think you will escape from a wealthy, dear one, and then into a wealthy, respecta- ble one; and you love Edgar, and that's all you want." All seems smooth and easy. "We don't see the obstacle?" "Here, you are right," replied Catherine, striking one on her forehead and the other on her breast; "in whichever place the heart lies in my soul and in my heart I'm convinced I'm wrong." "That's very strange. I didn't figure it out." "It's my secret. But if you will not mock at me, I'll explain it. I can't do it ! I'll give you a sense of how I feel." She seated herself by the throat and her countenance grew sadder and graver, and his clasped hands trem- bled. "Nelly, I can't never dream queer dreams?" she said suddenly, after the reflection. "Yes; I'm going to tell it then," I answered. "And so , I've dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after, and changed my mindset.

I'm going to tell it; but take it into consideration, and just not forget to talk about any part of it." "Oh! don't, Miss Catherine!" I cried. "We're dismal enough without conjuring up ghosts and visions to per- plex e. When you come, be so like yourself! Look at little Hareton! He's utterly sick, he is sweetly crying in his sleep!" "Yes; and Nelly; his father ...and he is my soli- tude! "Look at him, I dare say, when he was in heaven, he would have regarded one another as that chubby thing---nearly as young and innocent. However, Nelly, I shall not allow me to listen; it's not long, and I've no idea, but shall be merry to- night." "I won't hear it, I won't read it, I repeated hastily. I was superstitious about dreams then, and Nelly had had an unusual gloom in my head that made me dread something from which I might shape a prophecy that could lead to a fearful catastrophe. She quickly vexed, but did not proceed. Apparently taking up another subject, she recommenced in a short time. "If I were in heaven, Nelly, I should be , and it was." "Because I was not fit to go there," I answered. "All my dreams should be miserable in heaven." But not for that. I dreamt
