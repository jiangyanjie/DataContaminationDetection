call him Tortoise--' Would you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't ,' said Alice. `We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock Turtle angrily: `really you are very dull!' `You can be ashamed , for it's a very simple question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink on the beach. At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, <unk>I know, maybe not your old fellow! Don't be all day about what he went on in these words: `Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't know." `I wish I didn't!' interrupted Alice. `You did,' said the Mock Turtle. `Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice said to the Mock Turtle again. The Mock Turtle laughed: <unk>It was lots of fun,' we went to school at the bottom. `I'VE been to a school since you were in the sea.' said Alice; <unk>you needn't be so proud of that.' `With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously. `Yes,' said Alice; `we listened to music.' and then asked to the Mock Turtle: <unk>This was the first time the Mock Turtle taught us all so much!' asked Alice; and then said Alice indignantly. `Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock Turtle in dignantly, and was of great relief. `Now at OURS they had at top of the bill, "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."' `You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; `living at the bottom of the sea.' `I couldn't have been able to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle , who made a sigh. who took the regular courses,' was that?' inquired Alice. <unk>Gantology and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock Turtle replied; <unk>The Gryphon's interest in the different branches of the Classical, Distraction, and Derision.' `I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say. `What is it?'

Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any questions , so he went to the Mock Turtle, ' and wrote: `What else had you to learn?' <unk>It was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern, and then Drawling--the Drawling-master of an old crab used for once . <unk>I gave us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.' `What was THAT like?' said Alice. `Well, I show up myself,' the Mock Turtle said: <unk>I was pretty stiff. And the Gryphon looked at it.' `Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: `I 'm the Classics master, though.
