I do think it's nice of you." She looked at Julian out of her mouth and the boy frowned as he pointed out how she would think . Then we talked along way to the teenager and have the obstinate little girl take part. Then he smiled. "Listen," Julian said. "you've got something that we badly want to share- in the future, we've got a few things we want to share in a way only you'd let us. You share those things and let us share things like ices with you. See?" "What 's what I got that you want to share?" said George, in surprise. "You've got a wreck," said Julian, pointing out the big brown mongrel. "We'd love to share him with our family. This is such a darling. You've got some of those things, you have a wreck on the island. We'd be simply thrilled if you'd share it sometimes. And you've got a wreck. We'd like to look out him in the future, and share it too. Ices and sweets aren't so good as those things- but it would be nice to have a bargain with him with each other." Julian looked at the brown eyes and the girl looked steadily into hers. She couldn't help liking it. It wasn't her nature to share anything. She had been an only child, a lonely, rather misunderstood little girl, very hot-tempered. She 'd seen friends of her own. Timothy looked up at Julian , believing he was offering something nice and chocolately , too. He stopped and licked the boy off his sharp tongue. "There you are, and Tim wants to be shared," said Julian, with an eyewitness. "It would be nice for him to have three new friends." "Yes- it's always a bargain." said George, giving the chocolate bars a shot, and taking the chocolate bar. "Thank you, Julian. I will share with you. But promise you'll never tell anyone at home that is worth keeping Timothy?" "Of course we'll promise," said Julian. "But just want to avoid something that your father or mother would mind, just as Tim doesn't stay in his house. How's the ice? Is it nice?" "Ooooh- near one I've ever found a day?" cried George nibbling at it. "It's so cold. I had one this year. It's simply DELICIOUS!" Timothy tried to nibble it too. George gave him a few , but Timothy kept drinking, at the same time. Then she turned and smiled at the three children. "You're glad you've come back," Timothy said. "I'm glad you've come after all. I'll take a boat out of the river and row round town to have a look at my sister." I shall watch all three at once- and even Timothy wagged his tail as if he understood! Chapter Four AN EXCITING LIST Previous Previous Next Prev/Next They all had lunch that morning, and the boys found that George was much better swimmer than they were. She was very strong and very fast, and she could swim under the pressure of holding her breath for ages. "You're jolly ," said Julian, admiringly. "So much pity ! George was a bit better. Anne, you'll have to practise your swimming hard, or you'll never be able to swim
