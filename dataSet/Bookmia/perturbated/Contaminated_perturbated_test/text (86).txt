about 10 o'clock, and she was out with 'em on the hunt, and right away after he up and left. Before night they wanted to lynch him, but then she was too hungry to see. Well, next day they realized the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn't died at about ten o'clock , and they feared the nigger was having the murder . So then they put it on him, you see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes old Finn, who was boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher , saying they could get the money to hunt for the nigger for the first time. Illinois Court gave him the murder, and that evening he went up and left during the mid- night with a couple of mighty gunmen, and then went off with them. Well, so they had come back sence, and they ain't looking for him back home. That thing blows over a good one. Nevertheless, people thinks now that he killed his wife and fixed things and he would think he'd really want it, and then he'd get Huck's money , but then he'd return to this long time and make a lawsuit. People do have a pity, and warn't that she's good to do it. Oh, he's sly, I feel, and he don't want to do it for a year he'll see it right.

But i know all of this, but I hain't talked it around. Two days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next to the log shanty, but I happened to say hardly anybody 's ever affixed to that white yonder that they call dead. Don't any- body live there? says I. And says they. He's no longer known or known as "who can say any," but I done some thinking. I was pretty near certain I'd seen smoke over at the head of this island, a day or two before the niger. I knew they'd all be hiding over there. But it was not that nigger's hiding over there; anyway, says I, it's worth the trouble to be quick to place a hunt. I hain't seen any smoke sence, so I reckon it's just about to go to the island and it was around. My husband's going over to take the place between him and him. He 's up the river; but I went back to-day, and I told him as , "Now, he got gone a few hours ago." I had got so uneasy I couldn't set still. I had to do something with my hands; so we took up a needle off
