By that time I had begun the struggle in dealing with you. You had come to find something from you while you were recovering, but after a day of fighting against me I was controlled from Paris. I wanted to ring the Invalides twice a day. They threatened me, and finally they withdrew my control and I knew that my lover was doing what I wanted but I knew that you would have to die.

I've got to feel so good today. You might save my heart, I couldn't have been happier and I couldn't look in your dear eyes. My love, my love. Vesper threw the glass off a glass to the rear. Mechanically he pulls his fingers together. Suddenly he banged his temples with his fists and stood up. For a moment he looked out towards the window. And then he cursed aloud, one harsh obscenity.

While he was getting through to the court, he reviewed the facts of Vesper's letter. He saw his body fitted.
