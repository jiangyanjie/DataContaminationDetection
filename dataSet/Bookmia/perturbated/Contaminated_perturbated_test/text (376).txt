for him?" "Gone away! When was you married, then? The day you said?" "Yes, Tuesday, mother." "And now the Saturday, and he gone away?" "Yes, he's here, the meaning o' that? 'Nation seize such husbands I seem to get, say I!" Tess came to her, laid her legs in the matron's bosom, and burst into sobs. "I don't know how to tell 'ee, mother! You said to me, and wrote to me that I was not to tell him. I did tell him--I couldn't tell you how he went away!" "O you little fool--you little fool!" burst off to Durbeyfield, splashing the flame on herself in her agitation. "My good God! that ever so bad! I lived to say it, but I thought again, you little fool!" Tess was convulsed with weeping, the sound so deep. But she was relaxed at last. "I know it--I know--I know!" she prankly pushed out her sobs. "But, O God, I never wanted to tell him." Tess' life was so good--and I felt fearful of trying to blind him as to what had happened.
