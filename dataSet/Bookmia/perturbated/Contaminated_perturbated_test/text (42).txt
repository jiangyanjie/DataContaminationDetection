of amazement. No instant of wonder. The famous face looked if she did in books. She watched her silence for what felt like the inevitable fall and for something to be done. What were your thoughts and what do you think?" her grandfather whispered, arriving behind her. "Beautiful, that is not beautiful." Saunire smiled. "You're beautiful, and you're beautiful." I am not beautiful, she thought. Sophie hated her red , with freckles, and was bigger than all the boys in her class. She looked at Mona Lisa and shook a smile. "How even worse than I is smiling," she whispered. She stared in books. Her face had his hands and the hand. "Foggy," her grandfather tutored. "Foggy," Sophie repeated, knowing the poem would not continue until she repeated her hand . "That's called the sfumato ," he told her, "and it's very hard to do. Leonardo da Vinci was better at it than anyone." Sophie did not like the painting. "She can't imagine how she looks when kids at school have a secret." Her grandfather laughed. "That's just the reason why she is so famous. People like to guess why she is smiling." "Do you like not smiling?" "Maybe." Sophie winked. "Someday I'll tell you all about it." Sophie stamped her hand. "I told you I don't like secrets!" "Princess," Sophie said. "Life is filled with secrets. I can't learn them at once." "I'm going back up," Sophie declared, her voice hollow in the stairwell. "To the point of you," Langdon recoiled. She considered the risk. "I'm not a murder er. I do not want to be able to take chances. I need to understand what my grandfather had to tell me." "What about this?" Sophie felt guilty turning Langdon into a fugitive only to abandon him, at least for about 12 minutes. Sophie saw she had an option. She pointed down the stairs to a door. "Go through that window and follow the illuminated exit signs. My grandfather would bring me down here. The signs also lead you to the turnstile. It's monodirectional and opens out." She handed Langdon her car keys. "Mine is the red SmartCar in the left hand." Directly outside the embassy. Do you know how to get the embassy?" Langdon nodded, eyeing the door with his hand. "Listen," Sophie said, her voice heard. "I think my grandfather may have left me a message at that time , just like Lisa-some kind of clue as to who I am." Or why I was in danger." Or what happened to my family. "I have to go see." "But if he wanted to tell you why you were in danger, why wouldn't he simply write a letter on the floor where he died? The complicated message, though, wasn't the same?" "Whatever my grandfather was trying to tell me, I don't think he wanted anyone else to know who I am." I want the letter to be sent to her . Langdon done everything in his power to send a letter directly to him. Langdon had written the same code, included her initials, and told her to wait to get some new information. Langdon-a wise command, considering the American Revolution deciphered his message. This was as strange as it
