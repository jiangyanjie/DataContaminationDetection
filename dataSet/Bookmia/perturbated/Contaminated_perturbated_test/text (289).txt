well," he said,"this is all very pleasant. Hallo- is this the police already?" It was an officer who came up to his surprise, and had a few words with Uncle Quentin. Then one stayed behind to take down the children's story in his note-book . The others went to get a boat to the island. The men had gone from there! The boat from the fishing-smack had fetched out and now all that the men went to get to the waterside would be bad. The boat was still quite unusable. The inspector saw it with a grin. "Fierce young lady, Is that Miss Georgina?" he replied. "So I did this job pretty well- no one could get away in the water! We'll have to get it towed into harbour." The police got with them some of the ingots of gold from Uncle Quentin. They had sealed up the door of the boat so that no one else would log in until their uncle was ready to eat the gold. Everything was being done thoroughly and properly- though the whole thing had been done very well for the night. They knew not only that the men would have been caught and taken to the island, but that the police would bring back the whole new gold at once! They were all very tired that night and didn't make any excuses at all when their uncle was gone but that they were going to bed early.

"I was going to be such a beast to do this, I was going to be so glad you were home again because you were all home again! And now a new thing that makes me happy is the fear of you going away- which you will do, of course, when the holidays end. And then, after having three friends with me, enjoying adventures like the weekend, I will be all on my own again. "I have always been lonely before- and I shall be now." "No, you won't," said Anne. "You won't do so. This will stop you from going away ever again." "Well George , I can ask to go to the same boarding-school as I go to," said Anne. "It's such a lovely place that we are so excited to keep our eyes closed. I wish Tim could come here." Could he go there?" said George, her eyes shining. "Well, I'll go then. I always said I wouldn't-but it's because I see now how much more productive and happier it is to be with others than all by myself. And if I can have
