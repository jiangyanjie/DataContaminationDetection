'em. Frankie 's are made!" They performed a lot in their excitement. Near them on the floor lay several rather ugly men who had been hit about the head with some heavy design awards. Half a mile away, Ford pounded across the corridor and gathered a way out. They popped in to an open-plan computer bay. They glanced about wildly. "What do you reckon ?" answered Ford. A wild guess, I'd say ," said Zaphod, the chief investigator. Ford then ran down to the ground a distance to a large computer data bank and two computer banks. As the others started after him , Ford looked about by a Kill-O-Zap energy bolt cracked through their feet. After his slap, Ford drove two hundred inches in front of Ford and fried a small section of adjacent wall. A voice on a loud hailer said, "OK Beeblebrox, hold it right , I've got you covered." "Cops!" hissed Zaphod, and span around in a crouch. "You want to try a different system at all, Ford?" "OK, this way," said Ford, and the four of them ran through a gangway between two computer banks. At the top of the street appeared a heavily sized space- suited figure waving a bullet gun. "We don't want to shoot you, Beeblebrox!" shouted the figure. "Hey, we'll be fine!" Ford ran back and dived out of a gangway between two data process units. The light swerved in behind him. "We just can't shoot you, but you're two of them," said Ford. "Hi." "We're cornered." They squeezed themselves down in the door between a large computer data bank and two computer banks. They held their breath and waited. Suddenly the air exploded with energy bolts as both the cops opened fire on them simultaneously. "Hey, they're shooting at you!" asked Arthur, crouching in a tight ball, "I thought they said you didn't want to shoot us!" "I thought they said that," agreed Ford, when he stuck a head up for a dangerous moment. "Hey," he said, "I thought that you didn't want to shoot us!" and then said, "You're here, huh?" They were in awe. "But in a moment , Ford replied, "It isn't easy being with our partners." "Why can he say?" Ford replied in astonishment. "He said it isn't easy being with you?" "Well surely that's his advice, why would he say it?" "I'd have thought so." Ford replied, "Hey listen! I think we've got enough of our players to cope with you shooting us, so if you 're laying your problems on us as well, I think it could be easier to cope!" They turned back and then the loud hailer again. "Now see here, huh?" replied the man the loud hailer, "you're not surrounded with any dumb two-bit s, with low hairlines, little brains, and no conversation, we're a couple of intelligent minds that you'd probably quite like if we were shooting us . We're here to get out in trouble with you. We don't go around gratuitously shooting people and then bragging about afterwards in seedy space-rangers bars, like some people could mention! I go around shooting people gratuitously and then I agonize me afterwards for hours to my girlfriend!" "And
