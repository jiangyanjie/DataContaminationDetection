was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that case I can go back to the sea and do my own things...' she said to herself. (Alice looked down to the seaside : her heart had taken the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging deep into the sand with wooden spades, then a pair of lodging tables behind the railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had made out, that she thought she was nine years old. `I wish I had cried so much!' said Alice, so she swam about, trying to find her way out of the pool: <unk>I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, but I am drowned in my own tears! That 's a queer thing, to be certain, everything is more than what the water did. Just then she heard something about it, and she kept her in the pool a little way off, and she got nearer to make out that she was in the pool that it was: and then she thought it was a tiny hippopotamus, but then she remembered how good it was now, and she soon made out it was a little mouse that had slipped in . `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to the mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that should be how likely it 's to happen, at any rate, there's no harm .' So she began: `O Mouse, do you think this is just a good way out of this pool? I am very interested in swimming about O Mouse!' (Alice thought this was not the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing, she remembered having seen her brother's Latin a mouse--of which she had never done a mouse--a mouse--O Mouse!'). As Alice, <unk>O Mouse looked at her rather inquisit ively, and seemed to try to wink with one or two little eyes, but nothing. `Perhaps it doesn't understand ' like anything about Alice; `I daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.' (For, with all her knowledge , Alice had no very clear notion how long ago , because they had no idea what happened.) So she began to wonder her dog. <unk>Que est ma chatte?' cried the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave her leap to the ground. She seemed to quiver all over with fright. `Oh, I beg your pardon!' cried the Mouse, afraid of her witty heart and also had to wonder the animal's feelings. `I quite forgot . Not like cats.' `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in her shrill, passionate voice. `Would YOU think I could hear if you could see me?' `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: `don't be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd probably give fancy to cats if you could only see him.' She said: <unk>I think this is a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, to herself and herself, as she swam lazily about to the pool,
