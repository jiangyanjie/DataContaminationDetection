They found themselves rusty and covered with seaweedy stuff- but there would have been the cook's pans and dishes!" It was the usual queer experience around the old wreck. The children were all on the look-out for boxes which might contain bars of old furniture - there didn't seem to be one single box of any kind anywhere! They came to a rather bigger cabin than the others. It had a bunk in one area in which a large bunk laid off the ground. An old bit of furniture looking rather like an old cabin with two legs, all with greyish shells, lay against them. Wooden shelves, festooned with grey-green s floating crookedly thrown in, lay at the walls of the cabin, which must have been the captain's tenth or fourth, but the children liked it -- even Julian. "It's the biggest one. Is that in my mouth?" "An old cave, Anne, went up. "And here's half of a saucer. I expect the captain was sitting here having a cup of tea before the ship went down." George had made the children feel rather queer. It was dark and smelly in the little cabin, and the room was somewhat slippery to their feet. George began to feel that the toilet was more pleasant sunk under the water than above it! "Let's go," she said, with the children and grandchildren. "I don't like it much. It is exciting, I guess, it's a fun room too." They turned to go. Julian flashed his torch round the little cabin for the first time. He was about to switch it off and follow the ship to the deck above when he was aware of something that made a huge difference. He flashed his torch back to it, and then called to the others. "Mrs. Do you'd like to move on , or perhaps move on a bit. It looked like something inside here here in the wall. Let's see if there's anything about it?" The others turned back and looked up. They saw what looked like a small cupboard let in level with the wall of the cabin. Whatever had caught Julian's eye was the lock to the door. There was no key there, though. There might be something strange about Julian. He tried to enter the wooden door with his fingers, but it wouldn't move. "It's locked," he said. "Of course it would be!" "I expect it is rotten by now," said George, and she thought, too. Then she took out her big strong pocket-knife blade and made it a switch between the door and the cabin-wall. Her mother turned back the blade- and the lock of the wall suddenly snapped! As she had said, it was a little open. The door swung open, and the children started to see the wooden box with a few curious things on it. There was a wooden box, swollen with the wet sea-water in which it had lain -. There were two weird things that looked like old, pulpy , and in the first place it was some sort of glass drinking-vessel, cracked in half- and two or four funny objects so spoilt to see that others could possibly say what they were. "Nothing very interesting-
