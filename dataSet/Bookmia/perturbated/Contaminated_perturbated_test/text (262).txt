which I distinguished nothing. From my earliest remembrance I had been told that I was the kind of person in height , and I had never yet seen anyone who thought of me or who claimed any rage. What was I? The answer recurred, I answered only . I would look back to what these feelings tended, but allow me to return this story to the cottagers, whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation, delight, joy but which all terminated in sympathy and reverence for my protectors (for so I loved, in a half-painful manner, as I call them)." Chapter 13: "One time after my arrival, I learned the history of my friends. It was one which could not be made to impress itself in my mind, and it did a number of circumstances, each interesting , and very strange . It was so utterly inexperienced as I was. "The name of an old man was De Lacey. He was descended from a family in France, which had lived for many years in affluence, respected by people, and with his equals. His son was bred in the service of his country, and Agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction.

"Felix had accidentally been present in the trial; his ill-being and indignation were uncontrollable when he sat down and the decision of the court. He made, at that moment, a solemn vow to deliver him as soon as I came around for the trial." After many fruitless attempts to convince him of admittance to the court, Felix found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building, which was the dungeon of the unfortunate Muhammadan, who, loaded with chains, waited in the execution of the first sentence. He said a grate at night , making him known to the prisoner his intentions in the prisoner. The Turk, amazed and delighted, endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth. Felix then offers with contempt, yet when he saw the lovely Safie, who had been tempted to visit her father and who by her kindness demonstrated her lively gratitude, the youth of the captive continued to show him help owning to his mother that the captive possessed a treasure and not fully reward
