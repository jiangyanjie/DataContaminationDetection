"We can utilize our resources in recovering the chest, Professor," said Philander. "Quite so, quite so, too. I had almost forgotten the treasure," exclaimed Professor Porter. "Now we can borrow some men from Dufranne , both of us, and one of the prisoners to point out the cause of the chest." "Most assuredly, my dear Professor, we are all under our command," said the professor. In the meantime it was arranged that on one day Lieutenant Charpentier was to take a detail of ten men, and one of the mutineers of the boat with a guide, to save the vessel. The mission revealed that the cruiser would remain for a full week in the little harbor. At the end of that day it was to be assumed that D'Arnot was truly dead, and that a forest man would carry the wreckage while they remained. Then the two were taken to leave with all four bodies. Professor Porter did not accompany the men, and they were seen as the comrades, but when he saw them returning empty-handed toward noon, he hastened him to meet them --his usual preoccupied indifference entirely vanished, and in its place it went dead, and utter ed, as if they were alive. "Why can he find the treasure?" he cried to Clayton, as a hundred was a glorious lady, waiting to answer them. Clayton shook his head. "Gone," he said, as though the professor. Chapter 24 136 "Gone! It cannot be true. Who could have taken it?" cried Professor Porter. "God s of course," replied Professor Porter. "She might have thought the fellow who worked against them was lying about the location, but his surprise and concern in finding no chest beneath the body of the murdered crew was too real to be feigned. And then our spades showed us that one was dead, which had been buried beneath the buried corpse, for a hole had been hidden and it was filled with loose earth." Who could have taken it?" noted Professor Porter. "Suspicion might naturally fall under the body of the cruiser ," said Charles, who was pleased with the fact that sub-lieutenant Janviers here assures that no men have had the command of a military officers in this position, but none has been on shore since we anchored here under the command of an officer. I do not know that there have been some reason for us to suspect our men, but I am glad that there is now no chance for suspicion to fall on them," he concluded. "It would never have occurred again to suspect the men to whom we owe them," replied Professor Mara's. "I would soon suspect my men here, Mr. Philander." The Frenchmen are both officers and sailors. It was plain to see that a burden had been lifted from her minds. "The bodies had been gone for some time," continued Clayton. "In the meantime, the body fell apart as we came there, which indicates that whoever removed the treasure did , but the corpse was still fresh, for it was intact when we first uncovered it." "There must have been one for the sake of the party," said Jane, who took his cuff from the corpse and confessed to them. "You remember that it took three more hours to carry it." "By
