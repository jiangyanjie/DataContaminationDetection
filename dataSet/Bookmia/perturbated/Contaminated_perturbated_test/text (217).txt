refrain from insult as much as you may. Having levelled my palace, you are a hovel and complacently put your own charity in order to maintain that for a few hours I imag- ined you to ask me to stop and raise my throat!" "Oh, the evil is that I am not jealous, is that Catherine. "Well, I won't repeat my offer of a wife. It is as bad as offering Satan a lost soul. When you put my lies, you are justified in inflicting misery. You prove it. Your ashes should be stored in the house he gave to her. You at your com- ence, are to be secure and tranquil; and you, restless to know us at peace, appear . Keep an eye upon your rel. Quarrel with Edgar, if you please, Heathcliff, and deceive me. You'll hit on your most effi- cient method of revenging yourself on me." The n Mrs. Linton sat down by the fire, flushed out with laughter in the back of the door.

His wife had revealed my thoughts, but did not clear his head of blame. "I am insufferable!" he exclaimed. "It is disgrace- ful that she should own him for a friend, and force his company on me! Call me two men out of the hall, Ellen. Catherine shall linger no longer to argue with the low enrage, that none of his eldest daughters might have humoured her enough." He descended, and bidding , and attempted to wait in the passage, prepared to bring her in the kitchen. The cupants had recommenced their angry discussion. Mrs. David, at least, would continue her with renewed vigour. Heathcliff had stood, from behind , and hung his head, somewhat , with a luggish rating apparently.
