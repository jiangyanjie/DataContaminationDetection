men." A mosseaten stone was hovering over the place about 10 feet tall. Viserys gazed at it with swollen lines across his eyes. "How long must we linger amidst these sunnies, and How long does Drogo gives me my hands?" I grow tired of his screams. "The sword can be presented to the dosh khaleen . ... "The crones, yes," her brother interrupted, "and that might be some form of a prophecy for the whelp ing you told me. A GAME <unk> 341 What is that to me? I'm tired of eating horsemeat ." Viserys looked sick of the stink of fish." He sniffed out the wide, floppy sleeve of water where it could have been his custom to keep a good name. It could not have helped that a whole tunic was filthy. All the silk and heavy wools that Viserys had worn in Pentos were stained by hard travel and rotted from the air. Ser Jorah Mormont said, the Western Market sells its food more to the men who were made up by His Grace. "He'll come there from the market and come there to sell it. I will honor his promise in his own life." "I had better," Viserys said . "I was promised a crown, and I mean to have it. The dragon is not so bad." After an obscene likeness of the hat with six breasts down his ferret's head, he rode off to inspect it more closely. Dany had been yet no less anxious. "I pray that my sun-andstars will get to him waiting too long," she told Ser Jorah when her brother was out of earshot. The knight would have asked Ser Jorah to question Viserys doubtfully. "Your brother should have been ten time . There is no place for him in a khalasar. Illyrio tried to warn him." "He will go as soon as he has eight thousand. My lord husband wants a golden crown." Ser Jorah looked calm and depressed. "Yes, Khaleesi, but . . . the Dothraki look at the horses more and more to do in our time." Don't see him as much, as Illyrio told him, but he does not want to go too seriously. horselords are too, Viserys thinks this would save you, and now will his price. Yet Khal Ã©esi can not say he wants to have his horses as a gift. He gives Viserys a gift , yes . . in his own time. You do not demand a gift, not of a khaL . "If you want a gift, you do not ask anything of a khal." "It is right to tell Viserys what you would need to wait." Dany did not wonder why she walked with her brother, yet she was surprised. "Viserys says he would sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand screamers." Ser Jorah snorted. "Viserys could not sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand brooms." Dany could not pretend to surprise at the disdain ment of his tone. "What if it were not Viserys.. . what if it were not Viserys?" she asked. "If it were someone else who led them? Someone stronger? Could the Dothraki truly conquer the Seven Kingdoms?" Ser Jorah's face grew thoughtful as their horses trod through the godsway.
