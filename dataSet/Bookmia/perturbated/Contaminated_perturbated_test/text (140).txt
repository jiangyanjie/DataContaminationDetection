that day, I was wondering dreamily if the orange color looked like that, as she saw Diana come flying down through the firs, over the log bridge, and up the slope, with a fluttering newspaper in her hand. Anne stood up and jumped across her feet, knowing at once what the newspaper contained. The n she realized she was out! Her heart beat, and her heart beat until it hurt her. She could not move a step. It would take a half an hour to her before Diana came rushing into the hall and burst into the hallway, even knocking, so at she could be there for Anne. "I passed," she cried, "passed the list-you 're both-you're ties-but the pass list is first. Oh, I'm so proud!" Diana towed paper around the table and herself on Anne's bed, utterly weak and incapable of speech. Anne lighted the door to get the match -and using almost half a dozen matches before his hands had left the task. Then she snatched up the map, and had passed-there was her name on the very top of a list of two hundred! She thought a lot of people would pass-and she was worth living for. If so, I could see her just splendidly, but Diana, recovering sufficiently to sit up and speak, but the starry eyed and rapt, was sure Diana uttered a word. "Father brought you home from her wife's life." I went to go to the hospital not ten weeks before he came out on the afternoon . Not, I didn't know, and won't be here till tomorrow by mail-and when I saw the pass list I just rushed over like a man. You've all passed, every one of you, everyone and all, although now the last few names in the pass list were Rose and Ruby did pretty well-they're halfway up-and so did Anne. Josie just scraped through her marks to spare, but you'll see she'll put on as many airs as if she'd led. Won't Miss Stacy be delighted? Oh, Anne, what would it feel like to see your name at the head of a pass list like that? If it were me I know I'd go crazy with joy. I am pretty sure where it is, but I did get a bit calm and cool that spring evening." "I dazzled inside," said Anne. "I can say new things, and I can't find anyone to say them in. I never can say this-yes, I could too, just once! I did make myself think 'what if I should come out first?' quakingly, you know, for it seemed so vain and I think I should lead the lady and be gracious. To show me a little, I must run out to the field to tell Matthew. Then Anne was going to walk up the field and tell the good news to the young woman. "I hurried to sit below the barn where Matthew was coiling hay, and, as luck would have, Mrs. Lynde was going to get to tell Marilla at the lane . . Matthew," exclaimed Anne, "I've passed and I'm first-or one of the first! I'm not vain, but I'm thankful." "I guess I always know who I'm," said Matthew, gazing at the passing list
