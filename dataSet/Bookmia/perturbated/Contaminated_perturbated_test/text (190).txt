draw it out for you.' And in her practical way she looked around a small shed where that was hung, and with a twig -filled nest began to map on the fender. On the door, Winston looked through the shabby little room above Mr Charrington's door. Through the window the enormous bed was made up, with blankets and a coverless bolster. The old-fashioned clock with the twelve-hour face was file:///F|/rah/George%20Orwell/Orwell%20Nineteen%20Eighty%20Four.txt ( 170) [1/17/03 5:04:51 AM] , which he sat away on the mantelpiece. In the corner, on the gateleg table, the glass, which he had sat up on his last visit gleamed softly out of the half-darkness. In the fender was a battered tin oilstove, a saucepan, one of his cups, provided by Mr Charrington. Winston bent on the burner and set a pan , going to boil. He had brought an envelope full of Victory Coffee and a pot. The story said seventeen-twenty: it was nineteen-twenty really. It was coming at nineteen-thirty.
