hate of earth's steel, so the Wolf - the malice crueller than rusty steel; and the hunters ran into the rent by their clamour and fell from on high and choked the bear op Esgalduin. There was nothing, and he lied to the death; but Thingol gave no words to him, and he knelt by Beren, seeing that he was sorely hurt. Huan and Thingol were in front of him, but the hand for one hour slew Carcharoth; but there in the woods of his own doom the Wolf was fulfilled, and he fell mortally, and the venom s entered into him. Then he came, and then Beren spoke for the third time with no words - then he said farewell before leaving behind the Wolf. They spoke not, but laid his hand upon the side of the Wood; so they parted. Mablung and Beleg took to the rescue, but when they looked and the was done they cast their spears and cut. Then Mablung took a knife and ripped their belly on the Wolf; and they watched closely. They looked well nigh all consumed as they fought at fire, but the hand of Beren that held the jewel was yet another fire, and when Mablung reached forth by the hand none more, and the Silmaril lay the light of the sheep, and the light of the Wild, the shadows of the forest all about hem.

For the spirit of Beren at her bidding tarried . The halls of Mandos, unwilling to leave the world, until Lthien could say her last farewell towards the dim shores of the Outer Sea, whence Men that were set out never to leave again. But then the spirit of Lthien fell down into darkness, and at her birth it was the pity of the sun that seen on her body lay the flower that they cut off and lies for , unwithered by grass. Then a winter, as it was the hoar age of mortal Men, fell upon Thingol. But at its end, the spirit of Beren fell upon Lthien, to the heavens, and a shadow of the sun are still the rest of the Eldali, beyond the mansions of the river and upon the confines of the world. The seas that wait sit in the shadow of their thought. But her
