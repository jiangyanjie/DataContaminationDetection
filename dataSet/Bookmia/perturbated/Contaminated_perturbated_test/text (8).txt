and at every moment being aware of it. There are strong minds, great humour, but those who possess the hard texture of the structure are very likely to go without falling into this division of this kind. They are ordinarily human, and of whom forms are of paramount importance. Their field of expression and art is among the external phenomena of these human beings. They possess the vast ability in the processes of arranging, and in the manner of creating and arranging themselves, achieving heavy, solid unrealities, such as gold, landed estate, offices of trust and emolument, and public honors. With these materials, and with deeds of this aspect, done in the public eye, an individual of this class builds up, as it were, an impressive and stately edifice, which, in the minds of other people, and ultimately in the public view, is no other than the man's character, or , by himself. Behold, therefore, a palace! Its splendid rooms and its entire collection of spacious apartments are floored in mosaic-work of costly marbles; its windows, the whole facade, and the facade, admit the sunshine through the most transparent of plate-glass; its high cornices are gilded, and its ceilings gorgeously painted; and its dome--through which, from the central pavement, you may gaze up to the sky, as with no obstructing medium between--surmounts the whole. With no more and nobler emblem could any man desire to embrace his character? Ah! but , as we know, there was a low and big dome --some narrow closet on the ground-floor, shut, locked and bolted, and coiled away,--or beneath the marble pavement, in an ear, with the thick slab of marble above,--may be a little decayed, and still decaying, and in the death-scent , and so on. The other will wander through the palace! The inhabitant will be conscious of it, as the palace has long been his treasure. Neither one nor the visitors, for they smell only the rich odor s which the master sedulously slowed over the palace, the incense which they bring, and delight to burn before him! Now and then, perchance, comes in a seer, before his gifted eye the whole structure had in thin air, leaving only the hidden nook, the bolted ceiling, the cobwebs festooned over its forgotten door, or the deadly hole under the wall. Above this, is the decaying corpse within. Here, we are to consider the true emblem of the man's life: the deed that gives a blessing it possesses to his life. And, beneath the surface of a stomping house, a midst that pool of stagnant water, foul odors, a thousand impurities, and, one in his mind, an abomination, above which he may say his prayers, without remembering it,--is this man's miserable soul! Of course, his sound , this man, brings a train of remark somewhat more closely to Judge Pyncheon. He must say (without in the way of making the crime to a personage of his eminent respectability) that there was enough of splendid rubbish in his life to erode and paralyze a more subtle and subtile conscience of the woman the Judge was ever troubled with. The presence of his judicial character, while on trial, gave him the faithfulness of his public service in subsequent
