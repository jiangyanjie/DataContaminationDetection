me that is just for him .' asked a Jew, pointing to Sikes as he looked. 'What could I say, yer what?' asked his colleague, Noah, shaking himself pettishy. 'That about--NANCY,' said Fagin, clutching Sikes by the wrist, as if to prevent his leaving the house before he escaped. 'Your friends said.' 'Oh how did you come home to.' 'You followed her?' 'Yes.' 'To London Bridge?' 'Yes.' 'Where she met two people.' 'What she did.' 'I've seen a woman and a lady that she had gone through, and her own accord before, who asked her to give up all her pals, and Monks first, which she did--and to go to that, which she did--and asked her what house it was that we meet at, and go to, which she did--and where it could be best watched from, which she did--and what time the people were there, which she did. 'Note she said . She told it all every day - that was a threat, without a murmur--she did--did it.' 'But Fagin, half mad with the right,' replied Noah, scratching his back. 'That's just what it was!'
