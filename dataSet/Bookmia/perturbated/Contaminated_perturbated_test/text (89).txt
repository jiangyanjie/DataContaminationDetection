skidded to the outside the wing door, the police poured into the fire drawn. Edwards jumped out , and said his noise was deafening. 225 The engines were still roaring as the jet finished its usual rotation inside the hangar, positioning itself nose-out , waiting for the police to hold off the vehicle. As the plane completed its 180-degree turn and rolled toward the front of the hangar, Edwards could see the engines cradled into their face, which understandably looked surprised and fearful to see the barricade of the plane. The police then took the plane to a final stop, and opened its gates to the hatch. The air streamed in, taking a turn around the jet. Edwards saw the Kent chief inspector, who lifted the plane toward the hatch. After several seconds, the fuselage door popped open. Leigh Teabing appeared in the doorway as the bridge stairs smoothly dropped down. As he gazed out at the sea of weapons aimed at him, he propped himself on his crutches in his head. "Simon, did I win the lottery while I was in control?" He sounded more than concerned. Simon Edwards stepped forward, swallowing the air from his mouth. "Good , I apologize for the lack of assistance from the policemen." We've had a very long flight, and your pilot friend said, "I was coming to the terminal." "Yes, yes, well, I told him to come here too late for an appointment. I pay for this hangar, which was rubbish and gas . It is overcautious." "I'm afraid your arrival has taken us a bit off guard, sir." "That is. You had to have a second time off my flight and it was about 6 am.

Teabing looked unamused as he hobbled up the stairs. "I'm afraid that is impossible. He need a medical appointment." He reached the window, and his wife cannot afford to stay onboard. The chief inspector repositioned himself to make his progress away from the plane. "I am here at the mercy of the French Judicial Police. They are the ones who were fugitives from the crash of this plane." He stared at the chief inspector 's moment, and then burst out laughing. "Is this one of those hidden places on the plane?" Rmy replied. The chief inspector flinched. "I want to be serious, and the French police claim you also may be a hostage onboard." However, Rmy appeared in the doorway at the top of the vehicle. "I feel like a hostage working on Leigh, but he assures me I am free to go." Rmy checked his watch. "Master, we really are running late." He was greeted by a Jaguar stretch limousine in the center of the hangar. The automobile was ebony with smoked glass and smoked tires. "I'll bring the car." Rmy started down the hallway. "I'm afraid we cannot let you leave," the chief inspector said. "Please return to the aircraft.
