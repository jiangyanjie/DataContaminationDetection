. He played on his flute, for the happiest time on the two or four occasions after the Christmas . He would take the village back down their instruments, and come to the house and would play them, with his face beaming with blessedness and peace. Sometimes another time they ask Unoka's band and their choir, they have to come and stay with them and teach them how to live with the group. They are offered to such hosts for as long as they live in their four markets, making music and feasting. Unoka was very happy with the good hire and the good fellowship, and he loved the hot season of the year, when the sun had stopped and the sun was shining every morning with dazzling beauty. And he was not too hot either, because the rain and the dry harmattan wind was blowing down from the north. Some years the harmattan was very severe and a dense haze hung up in the atmosphere. Old men and children would then sit round log fires, warming themselves up. Unoka loved it all, and he loved the first kites that returned from the dry season, and especially those who sang songs of their childhood with them. He would remember his own childhood, how he had often wandered around looking out the kite , and putting the world up against the blue sky. As soon as he found one he would sing with his little children, welcoming it to the world in its long, long , long, long time, to see if it had brought home any lengths of cloth. That was years ago, when I was young. Unoka, the grown-up, was a sweet man who was poor and his small children had barely enough to eat.

Okoye moved into an area and soon returned with a small wooden disc containing a kola nut, some alligator pepper and a lump of white chalk. "I have kola," he announced when his guest was down, and passed the disc over to the guest. "Thank you. He who brings kola brings life. But I think you ought to break kola," said Okoye, passing back the disc. "This is not a bad thing I think," and they argued like this for a few moments , but accepted the honour of breaking the kola. Okoye, meanwhile, took the lump of chalk with some lines on his table and replaced his big white chalk with chalk when he had been down. Okoye saw the kola, Unoka , and looked around their kola's life and health, and the battle of their enemies. When they had their own conversation, they talked about many things: about heavy rains and drowning the yams, about the next ancestral feast and
