experience had too sorrowfully corrected. Yet, amidst the changing visions of life, his principles remained the basis of benevolence , and he retired from the multitude 'more in PITY than this', to scenes of simple nature, to the enlightenment of many pieces of literature, and to a multitude of domestic virtues. He was a part of the younger branch of an illustrious family, and it was designed, that most of his patrimonial wealth should be supplied by a splendid alliance , or by success in the intrigues of public affairs. But St. Aubert himself so far sought a sense of spirit to fulfil the latter dream and there was too small a potential ambition to sacrifice what he had to do: to attain happiness, to the attainment of wealth. After the birth of his father he married the amiable woman, his equal in age and not his superior in age.

At first he disengaged himself from the world, and tried not to realize the difference between those of us, for many years. The building, as they stood, looked like a summer cottage, rendered interesting to a stranger , in the neat simplicity, or the beauty of the surrounding area, and that considerable additions were necessary to make it a comfortable family atmosphere. Nonetheless, the artist felt the highest level of affection for every part of the fabric, which he remembered in its long era and would not suffer a stone of it to be lost. The point was that the interior adapted to the style of the old building and had to deal with it only to form a charming and unique building. The taste of Madame St. Aubert was conspicuous in its simplicity where the same chaste simplicity was observable in the furniture, and in the ornaments of the apartments, that characterized the manners of the inhabitants. The library occupied the outer side of the chateau, and divided it into eight houses, and was replaced by a collection of the
