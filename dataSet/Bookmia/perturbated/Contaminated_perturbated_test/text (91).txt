smiled with the first hint of conspiracy she screamed, 'I would like to very much be here', he said, 'and then perhaps you may chaperon me to the Casino where Monsieur Mathis tells me you are really at home. Perhaps I will bring you luck.' With Mathis gone, her attitude towards him showed a sudden warmth. She seemed to acknowledge that they were doing something different in their team and, when they discussed the time and place of their lives, had realized that it would be quite simple for them all to plan the details of his life with him. He did not take the advice for her. He felt that after all the excitement would be strong and excited by her role and that she would work willingly with him. He had imagined many hurdles before establishing a rapport, but now he felt like he would get straight down the road taking action. Bond was quite honest to himself about the hypocrisy of his work with her. As a woman, he wanted to sleep out on her bed, but only when the job had been done.

It was a moment of silence. Some objects pattered up to the floor. Bottles slowly toppled off the surface of the glass. At the end, there were screams and a sound to the door. 'Stay there,' said Mathis. He kicked back his chair and hurtled through the empty window-frame on to the pavement. . - TWO MEN IN STRAW ET - After Bond left the road he walked on the side of the tree-lined boulevard towards his hotel a few hundred yards down the street, but was hungry. The day was still beautiful, but by now the sun was quite shining and the plane-trees, spaced about twenty feet apart across the verge between the bars and the bars, gave a long way into it. There were few people abroad and the two men standing quietly under a tree on the opposite side of the boulevard looked out of place. Bond noticed them when he
