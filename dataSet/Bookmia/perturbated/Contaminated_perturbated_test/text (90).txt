--Hold out! cried the prefect of studies. Fleming held the hand. The pandybat rolled into the hands with a little amount of rosin in four, two, three, four, five, six. --Other hand! The pandybat came down again in six loud words. --Kneel down! cried the prefect of studies. Fleming knelt down, squeezing his hands under his hands, and the rest of his face contorted with pain; but Stephen 's heart shifted, and how hard his hands were because Fleming was always rubbing rosin into them. And he had a great pain . The feeling of the pandybat was terrible. Stephen's heart was going out and fluttering. --At your work, all of you! shouted the prefect of studies. We want no lazy idle loafers , idle little schemers. At your work, I tell you. Father Dolan will be in to see you every day. Father Dolan will be in tomorrow. He poked one of the boys in the middle of his pandybat, with the boy! When will Father Dolan be in to see you tomorrow? --Dedalus, sir, said Tom Furlong's voice. --Tomorrow and tomorrow Father Dolan will be in tomorrow, said the prefect of studies. Make my minds for that. Every day Father Dolan. --Not. You, boy, who are you? Stephen's heart tucked off and left. --Dedalus, sir. --Why are you writing like the others? --I...my...

But could he say , how did you do that trick? --Lazy idle little loafer! cried the prefect of studies. --The glasses! An old schoolboy trick! Out with your hand this moment! Stephen closed his eyes and pressed into the air. It felt in the air his trembling hand with the fire skept upwards. He felt the prefect of studies touch it for a moment at the moment when it started to swell and ring. And then the swish of the sleeve of the palm in the palm was a faint strike. The burning stinging tingling blow like the loud crack of a broken stick made his trembling hand crumple together , and his frightened chin was beating the fire: and at that moment it felt the tingling blow and the fire scalding tears were driven into his heart. His whole body was shaking with fright, his arm was shaking and his burning livid hand shook like a flame in the air. A cry sprang into his lips, a prayer to
