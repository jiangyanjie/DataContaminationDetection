So far I had got before I ever heard St. Andrew write a book and he told us of the first woman in a pew, of the change from the bride's manner, of so transparent a woman obtaining such gifts as the dropping of a bouquet, of her own love for her confidential maid, and of her own allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners' minds were the consequences of taking possession of her beloved ancestors to another woman without her prior claim to--the whole situation became absolutely clear.
