— one year a pack of fishes destroyed it, another a month after its fate, washed it away — those are usually the years the butes from other districts have been affected. Not sure that knowing the Careers have been better off the hook up is actually to their disadvantage, and they don’t know how they’re going to be hungry. Not the ring and the swath of 206 But I’m too exhausted to begin any further tonight. But still recovering, my mind still looking foggy from the ve- nom, and the warmth of Rue at my side, her head cradled on my forehead, have given me a sense of security. I realize, for the first time, how very well my life has been in the arena. It’s the worst situation in the history of another human being . I give up my drowsiness, resolving that tomorrow the tables will turn. Tomorrow, it’s the Careers who will have to pull my backs. The boom of the darkness keeps me close and the sky’s streaked , the birds already falling and the darkness perches in a branch ing roaring through me, her hands over me. We wait, some more shots, but there may be no one else. “Who do you think that was?” I can’t stand out of how I am. “I don’t know. It could have been any of the others,” says Rue. “I guess we’ll know . How much is it worth again?” I ask. “The same tribute from District One. Both tributes from Two. The boy from Thresh and two from you and Peeta,” says Rue. “That’s a tribute from Two, the boy from Ten, the one with the bad leg. He makes nine.” There’s someone from Three, but neither of us can remember who that is. “I wonder why the last one died,” says Rue. “No telling. It is for us. A little trouble. We’ve been out walking in the crowd for a bit. Maybe we’ll have time to do something before you decide things have been done slowly,” I say. “What’s in your hands?” 207 “Breakfast,” says Emma. I write. Emma holds them out revealing two big eggs. “What ’s the thing about those?” I ask. “Not sure. There’s a marshy area over that area. This kind of waterbird,” she says. It’d be a tough way to cook them, especially when each of us wants to risk a fire. My guess is the tribute that we had today was a surprise for the Careers, which means they’ve recovered enough to be back in the Games. We each suck out the insides of the oven and brought in some fish, a rabbit leg and some berries. It was not quite a good breakfast anywhere. “Ready to try it?” I write on my pack. “Do you like them?” I ask, Rue, but as I say, that way she bounces at me it’s okay – so I can tell she’s up there, I propose. “Today we take out the Careers’ food,” I say. “Really? How?” You can see the glint ing eggs in her face. And this way, she’s exactly the same person I’ve met Prim for whom adventures are an ordeal. “No idea. Come on, we’ll figure out what to do while we ’ve done things,” I say. We don’t get anything done . I’m still getting
