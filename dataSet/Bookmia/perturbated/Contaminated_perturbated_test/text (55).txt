naught of it; for Manw had not revealed it to them. They spoke to themselves as to how they kept the secret of Mortal Men, seeing how the silence of the men would be twisted . Little understood and yet concerning is engrossed with the thought in those words, because he had paid small heed to the Third Theme of the Lord but now the Vats of the Lord, among the Elves , held them captive, so that Men would seek them and supplant them in the hands of the Lord. As for the Valar , they might more easily sway the men in the fewer and weaker race, defrauding the men of the Lord, affluent against Ilvatar. Small truth was there in this, and little have the Valar ever prevailed to sway the wills of Men; but many of them were unaware, more than half believed, the evil words. Thus ere the Valar were aware, no longer a mystery. The will of Valinor was all too complicated, in this Noldor and Fingolfin world they were seen in murmur , and they became filled with pride, for much of the will which Fanor had and knew came to life with an excellent gift from his children. Fiercest burned the new flame of desire for freedom and wider realms as it was the eager heart of Fanor; and Melkor laughed in his secrecy, for to that mark all had been addressed, hating Fanor above all, and lusting ever for the truth that none of these words had not suffered to approach; for though at great feasts Fanor would have to be seen blazing in his brow, at other times they were guarded close, locked in the deep chambers of his head with the place of a tangled wall.

But to Fanor , Melkor said: 'Beware! Small !' He has the proud son of Mriel and will be praying for the children of Indis. This has become great, and Melkor has his father in his hand. It will not be long before he goes forth from Tna!' And as Melkor was praying that these lies were smouldering, and that pride and power had come awake among the Noldor, he left his family, and began the battle with weapons; and in that time the Noldor began the smithying of swords and axes and swords; and also they made displaying the tokens of many houses and kindreds that vied one with another; and these only they wore abroad, and of course they did not
