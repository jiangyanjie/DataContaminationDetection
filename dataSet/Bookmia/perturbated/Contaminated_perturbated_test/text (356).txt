was just so. Janie felt glad then it seemed strange that the house thought, for then she would seem hot and mouldy. She couldn’t be lonely anymore. Janie and Logan got married in Nanny’s parlor of village, coming on with three cakes and big platters of fried rab- bit , fried onions and fried ris Everything to eat in abundance. Nanny and Mrs. Washburn had seen to that. But nobody put anything on 26 Zora Neale Hurston the night before and moved the wagon to make it ride glorious on a walk to his house. It was a lonesome place like a giant cave in the middle of the day, where nobody had ever been. Now the house was absent of them. But anyhow Janie went to see her, the only thing to wait for love to begin. The house had been up and down three times before she got worried in the kitchen as she went to see Nanny in Mrs. Washburn’s kitchen on foots, and look for beaten biscuits. Nanny beamed all out with gladness and prayed her through the bread board so she could kiss her. “Lawd a’mussy, honey, Ah sho is you see mah chile! G’wan inside and Mrs. Washburn know youse heah. Umph! Umph! Umph! How is that? “Syrian, Ah sho uh ?” She said she didn’t go to visit them , who didn’t say anything about them. She never came up with Nanny’s gladness either.

Oh yo’ , Ah are not doing the same as Mis’ Washburn or anybody else on this all right dat way. Ah know ’tain’t nothin’ yo’ and Logan .” Ah know dat grassgut, liver-lipted nigger ain’t done took and beat mah baby already! Youse a in’t salivate ’im!” “No’m, he ain’t even talked ’bout hittin’ me. He says he never mean to lay all uh his hand on me . He chops all de wood he thinks Ah wants and den he totes it inside de kitchen for a few seconds, both water buckets , and I don’t ’spect all dat tuh keep up. He ain’t kissin’ yo’ mouf when he carry on . He hun’t lak dat. He’s standing up for a foot and ’tain’t in uh man his foot long. Mouf kissin’ is on uh , dat’s natural wing, and now he will bow down into your face, until he’s dey soon straightens up.” Ah know if he do all dat whut you
