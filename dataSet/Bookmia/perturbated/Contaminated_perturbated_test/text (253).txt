Hurston published seven books—four original books of folklore, and an autobiography—and also fifty shorter works between the middle of the Renaissance and the middle of the Korean War, and was chosen as a black author in the United States. The long history she moved into the literary career then lapsed reflects her staunchly independent political stances about any deficiency of craft or tradition that was likely ignored after the early fifties, even by the Black Arts movement in the United States. Despite this noisy and intense spell s and image- and myth-making of so many black writers from remaindered oblivion, Hurston embodied a more or less harmonious , problematic unity of opposites. It is this fact that Hurston refuses to lend them to the glib categories of “radical” or “conservative,” “black” or “black,” or “Uncle Tom”—categories of little use to criticism. It is possible that Hurston may have left Hurston’s way in Black history and her stances can readily be read by her important essay (“In Search of Zora Neale Hurston”) in Ms. magazine . Hurston had made Hurston’s place in black literary history an ambiguous one . The rediscovery of Afro-American writers has usually turned on larger topics, of which the writer’s work is supposedly a mere reflection. The deeply compelling part of the rediscovery of Zora Neale Hurston is that she generated it primarily from a maternal literary ancestry. Alice Walker’s novel recounts her attempts to replace the unmarked ancestor in the Garden of the Heavenly Father in the segregated cemetery in Fort Riley County, Kansas. Hurston became a metaphor for the black woman writer’s search for tradition. The craft of Alice Walker, Gayl Jones, Gloria Naylor, and Cade Bambara bears, in different ways, strong affinities with Hurston’s. The black community devoted its attention to Hurston signifies a novel sophistication in black literature: they read Hurston not only of the spiritual kinship inherent in such relations but also used black values and rituals, the Subtle and various, and the coming to consciousness of black women, so absent in mainstream fiction. The nipheric tidiness of the vernacular became the fundamental framework for the synthesis of one of the books of the nineteenth century , later in the classic work Their Eyes: A Family Watching God, published in 1937, which is more closely related to Henry James’s Revelation of a Lady and Jean Toomer’s Cane than to Langston , and Michael Wright’s proletarian literature, so popular in the Depression. The charting of Janie Crawford’s books and an autonomous imagination, Their Eyes is an interesting lyrical novel that correlates the need of one of the first two husbands for the progressively larger physical space (and the gaudy accoutrements of upward mobility) with the suppression of awareness in their wife. Only with the first and last woman’s roustabout called Tea Cake whose unstructured frolics center around and about the Florida Sea, would she Janie at last bloom, as does the large pear tree that stands beside a tiny log cabin. She saw a small bee sink into the sanctum of a bloom; the thousand
