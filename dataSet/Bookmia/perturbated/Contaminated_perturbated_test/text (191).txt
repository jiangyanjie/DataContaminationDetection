planned that we're back at Delmonico's next Sunday, with Campanini 's room, and a lot of jolly people." She looked doubtfully from the banker to Archer. "Ah--that does tempt me! Except the other evening at Mrs. Olenska, I had not met a single artist since I've been there. I kind of do not know one or several very good fellows, he could bring to see you , but allow me," said Archer boldly. "Painters? What's the number of painters in New York?" asked Beaufort, in a tone implying that there could be none since he did not snap the pictures; and Madame Olenska asked Archer, with a grave smile: "Awk, yes, I think that seems charming. But I was really thinking of dramatic works, and I know I can do something for a while." My husband's house was always opened with painters and artists. She was looking to the words "my husband" as if no sinister associations were connected with her, in the midst of her first day to sigh the lost delights of her married life. Archer looked at her perplexedly, wondering if it were lightness or dissimulation that made she seem to touch so much of the past at the moment when she was risking her reputation in order to join with her new husband and make a change.

"Do you call it a meeting?" Beaufort returned his glance coolly. "Yes; because Archer still to talk business with Mr. Archer for a little while." "Ah," she said. There was no appeal , and with a slight smile, she recovered his composure, took him home from which he kissed with a practised air, and calling out from the threshold: "You get to Newland, if you can persuade the Countess to stop in town when you're included in the supper," and took her inside the room with his first step. For a moment Archer fancied that Mr. Letterblair had told her of his coming; but a quick break in favour of her to meet a man who made him change his outlook. "You know painters, you live in a much more quiet milieu?" She ginned at her eyes , drawing . "Oh, not exactly. I don't know how you can use the arts ; it's not as a matter of places in the milieu here, but they're like them; they're more like a very thinly settled outskirt." "But you care for such things?" he asked. I'm
