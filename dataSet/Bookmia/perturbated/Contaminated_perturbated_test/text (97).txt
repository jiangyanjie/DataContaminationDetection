know if you 're sure the rest of that is--at a hurling match between the Croke's Own Boys and the Fearless Thurles and to Stevie, Stephen was over the hard fight. My first brother, Davin, was stripped of the rest of his day playing hard for the Limericks but started up with the forwards half the time and shouting like mad. I never will forget that day. One of the Crokes gave me a woeful wipe at him one time in caman and I declare to God he was within an aim's ace of getting to the side of his shoulder; honest to the surprise of the crook of it caught him that time he 'd waited for. --I am glad he escaped, Stephen had to give you a laugh, but surely that was the thing that happened you? --Well, I suppose that is the problem for you, but leastways there was such noise after the match that I got a few more days off the field and I couldn't get any kind of help to give me a lift for, as luck would have it, there was a mass meeting that same day over in Kilmallock.
