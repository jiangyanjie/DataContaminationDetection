This obliged me to run at her, and she ran to the room that we had a near -drenched house before I caught her. 'Oh, it's you, is it?' said Hennan. 'Why, did YOU know who it was?" said I. 'And didn't YOU know who it was?' said Em'ly. I was going to call her, but she covered her face with her hands, and she wasn't going to kiss him right now, and ran away, laughing more than ever, sitting in the room. She seemed to delight in teasing me, which was a change in her I 'm grateful for very much. The tea table was hung, and our little locker was put out in its old place, but instead of being able to sit by me, I listened and bestowed her company upon that grumbling Mrs. Gummidge: and on Mr. Peggotty's inquiring why, rumpled she felt all her face to face, and could 've heard nothing of him. 'Her puss, it is!' said Mr. Peggotty, patting her with her hand. 'Her, it is! so sh' is!' cried Ham. 'Mas'r Davy bor', so sh' is!' and 'Admirt, and chuckled on it a lot, at the time, in a state of mingled admiration and affection and made his face a smile. Little Em'ly was drawn for them in fact; and by no one more than them, given him himself, the same thing could have happened by me laying her cheek against his rough whisker. That was my opinion, at least, when I was unable to do it; and I held Mr. Peggotty to be thoroughly in the right.

And here,' said Mr. Peggotty, giving Ham a backhanded hand, and he then pulled him into the chest, 'is another of those kids, and he don't think I'm going to do it.' 'If I had you for my guardian, Mr. Peggotty,' said I, shaking my head, 'I don't think I have the name of it.' 'Well said, Mas'r Davy bor'!' - Here I stepped down in an ecstasy. 'Hoorah! Well said! And in any case, you wouldn't! Hor! Hor!' - Here he returned Mr. Peggotty's back-hander, and little Em'ly got up , and joined Mr. Peggotty. 'And we were doing this.' 'That's sir?' said Mr. Peggotty to me. 'Steerforth?' said I. 'That's the difference with I, turning to Ham. 'I knowed it was something else that changed their way.' 'You said it was Rudderford,' observed Ham, laughing. 'Well!' retorted Mr. Peggotty. 'You had to steer his hand, ye? It ain't that simple, a miracle!' apologises. 'So what is he, sir?' 'He
