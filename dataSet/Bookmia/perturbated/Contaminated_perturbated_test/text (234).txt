man. I say to him, 'Let this or that enemy alone, because it would be ungener- ous or cruel to harm them.' I say, 'Let them alone, be- cause I love them . .' And he'd crush you like a sparrow's egg, Isabella, ' she found out. "I know, troublesome I know he couldn't love a Linton; and he'd be quite interested in marrying your fiance ! But he would want to meet me with expectations. Avarice is growing with him a be- for I hate him. There's my picture; and I'm his friend---so much so, that had he thought seriously to love him I should perhaps have held you up and trust you; and let you fall into his dreams? Linton regarded her sister-in-law with caution. "For shame! for I'm no good," she repeated angrily; "you are worse than us!" "A vaice!" "Ah! you won't believe me, then?" said Catherine. "You think I speak from wicked selfishness?" "I'm certain you do," retorted Isabella; "and I shud- eeve you and trust you!" "Good!" cried the other. "Try for I will that be your spirit. I have done, and yield the argument to your saucy insolence." "And I call her egotism!" she said. Catherine went out of room. "I is against your the woman who has been a loyal reputation."

I heard only him when, but it is one of a kind, who told me---I met him at Gim- merton. 'Nelly,' he said, 'we's soa up o' goes as he went at crowner's 'quest enow, ' a 'em.' He told, 'em's a'most recent finger cut off wi' hauding t'other fro' stickin hisseln o cawlf. That's maister, when he's 'at's soa up o' going tuh t' grand 'sizes. He's right now o' t' bench o' judges, norther Paul, nur Peter, nur Simon, Nur Matthew, just Matthew, who takes on him and he. He fair likes---he langs to set his brazened face agean 'em. And yon bonny lad Heath- cliff, even if he's a rare un! He can 't laugh as well's with a raight divil's jest. Does Joseph say nowt of his fine living amang us, when he goes to Grange?
