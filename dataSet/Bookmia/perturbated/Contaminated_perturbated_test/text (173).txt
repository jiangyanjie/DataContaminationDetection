foolish ness with a simple feeling that the only end in your death." Tarzan laughed, and in the moment the jungle had swallowed him. The men stood silent for some moments and quickly turned and walked back to the hotel veranda. Tarzan wanted to be sooner in the jungle than he took to the side, and it was with a slight humour and exultant freedom that he was he would have become, once more in the dense forest branches. This was life! Ah, how he loved it! There were nothing like this in its narrow arid sphere, hemmed in by restrictions and conventionalities. Even clothes would have left him without a hindrance and a dangling breath, and at last he was free. He quickly realized what a prisoner had been as in his youth, how easy it would have been to circle back to the coast, and then cross south and his own jungle and cabin.
