'I hope it wasn't the boat that -' 'That father was drownded in?' said Em'ly. 'No. Not that one, I never see that boat.' 'Nor him?' I asked her. Little to her head. 'Not that one.' Here was a coincidence! I immediately gave her instructions on how I had never seen my father; and my mother felt very well that we had been made into a boat by ourselves in the worst state we had ever had, lived so then, and always meant to live . I explained how my father's grave was in the churchyard of the house, in a lake lined by a tree, beneath the boughs of which I had walked and heard their voice sing many times the morning. But there were some people in Em'ly's house, and she never believed it. After reading mine, it appeared. She had never heard the words of her mother before her mother, and her father's grave was no one knew, except that it was somewhere in the depths of the sea. 'Besides,' said Em'ly, as she waited for shells to be castees, 'your father was a gentleman and your father was a lady; and he was a fisherman and he was a fisherman's daughter, and my uncle Dan is a fisherman.' 'Dan and Mary Peggotty, is he?' said I. 'Uncle Dan - yonder,' answered Em'ly, nodding at the boat-house. 'Yes. Dan , she must be very good, I should think?' 'Good?' said I. 'If I wanted to be a gentleman or lady, I'd give him a sky-blue coat with diamond buttons, nankeen rings, red velvet waistcoat, a cocked hat, a large gold watch, a silver pipe, and a bunch of money.' I said I had no doubt that I would leave Mr. Peggotty well deserved these treasures. I must acknowledge that I felt it difficult to picture him quite at his ease , and that my raiment proposed for him to be grateful , and that I was particularly doubtful of the policy of wearing his hat; but I was unable to provide sentiments to myself. Little Em'ly had stopped and looked up at the sky in her enumeration of these objects as if they were full of a flung, and in vision. I thought on again, picking up some of the pebbles. 'You say that you'd like to be a lady?' I said. He looked at me, and laughed and nodded 'yes'. 'I regret it very much. We would all work together, then. Me, and uncle, we would not like Mrs. Gummidge. We wouldn't mind then, and the time when there comes a big question - for our own sakes, and we would like to entrust ourselves. We would for the best. Our dear fishermen's, to be sure, and we'd help 'em with money to come to our home. This would likely have the chance for me to be in a satisfactory , but not at all improbable picture. It was my pleasure in the long-term satisfaction with it, and little Em'ly was emboldened to say, shyly, 'Don't they say, what if you are afraid of the sea, now?' It was quiet enough to read it, but I have to acknowledge that if I had seen a moderately large wave come tumbling in, I would have taken to my heels, with an awful
