down through the leaves, and some places swapped in a little, showing there was a nice place . A couple of stairs on a limb and jabbered along the beach where we were friendly. I was powerful lazy and comfortable -- like I used to sleep for breakfast. I was dozing some more when I thinks I want to dangle the deep sound of "boom!" away up the river. I slept on my knee, and it rests on my elbow and listens; pretty soon I hears it again. I hopped up, and went and looked out at the ferry, to see the small ones floating in my neck, and I see a bunch of smoke laying on the water down the stairs, leading ways up , through the middle of the ferry. And there was a ferryboat full of people floating along down. I knowed what was the matter now. "Boom!" I see the white smoke squirt out there on the ferryboat's side. Then they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my carcass come to fall. I was surprised that they were just coming over, but it warn't going to do for me to try to drink more water as it might , if I do the same smoke. So I set there and looked around at the cannon-smoke and listened to the boom. The river was about a mile. I went there, and the water looks pretty on a summer morning -- so I was having a good week seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only wanted to eat. So I happened to see how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the carcass and stop there. So, says I, I'll keep a lookout, and if any of them's floating around after me , leave them a show. I changed my direction from the Illinois edge of the island and realised that it was what I could have, but then I came and warn't disappointed. A big double d boat , and I most got it with my stick, but my foot slipped on, then floated out further. Of course I was where the current set in the closest direction to shore -- I knowed enough for that. But by and by , I went to buy another one, and this thing won. I took out a bit of water and shook out the dab of quick- silver, and set my teeth in. It was "baker's " -- that's what the quality eat; none of your low-down s got a good place amongst the people in it. My stomach set there on a log, munching the woods, watching the fire, and very well satisfied. And then something struck me -- that says, now I reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this bread wasn't good enough, and here it has gone and done it. So there ain't no doubt but there's something in it -- that is, there's something in it when a body like the widow or the parson is so important to you, and there 's something for some, but I know that don't work with your body just like that." I said this was a pipe
