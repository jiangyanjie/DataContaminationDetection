It was much like laughing at a man when sober for his erratic temperament and intoxication. It just crossed her mind, too, that he might have a faint recollection of his tender vagary, and was disinclined to allude to it from a conviction that she would take advantage of the opportunity it gave her of appealing for an early morning anew not to go. The man ordered by letter a vehicle to find the nearest town, and soon after breakfast it arrived. She saw in the beginning of the end--the temporary end, at least, when Clare felt his revelation of his tenderness , and the incident of the night raised dreams of a possible future with him. The harp was put on top, and the man drove to the farm, the old waiting-woman expressed sympathy after their precipitate departure, which led to a flamboyant declaration that the mill-work was not of the kind they wished to investigate, a statement that he said was not of no significance to them so far as it went. Beyond this there was nothing in the mind of their leaving a FIASCO for a FIASCO, or that they were not going together to visit friends. Their route lay near the dairy from which they started with such solemn joy in each other . The mills were days back, and as Clare wished to wind up his business with them for a little while, a friend called Mrs Tess could hardly avoid paying Mrs Tess a call at the same time, and she would excite them with their unhappy state.

The gold -colored summer picture was now gray, the colours mean, the mud, and the river cold. Over the barton-gate the dairyman saw the sheep which came forward, throwing into his face one of the horses appropriate in Talbothays and into the vicinity on the other side of the newly-married. They had gone to Crick 's House to be an exponent for them as they kept in the house, and several others of their old acquaintance, though Marian and Retty don't seem to be there. Tess valiantly bore the attacks on her and affected their behaviour far otherwise than they supposed. In the tacit agreement of husband and wife to keep their estrangement a secret they behaved as would have been before. Now although she would rather there had been no word on the subject, Tess had to hear in this story of Marian and Retty. In this couple they had gone home to her father's and Marian had left to look for employment elsewhere. It was a feeling she would come to no conclusion to dissipate the sadness
