and became welded into one hand, and they spoke of their tongue; though they were so small and they remained between them, the Noldor had the greater power of mind and body. They were all warriors and sages, and they built with stone, and loved its deep and open ness. in the Sindar o are now fairer voices and were more skilled in music, and they were their son of Fanor, and they loved the woods and the riversides; and they enjoyed the dance and wandered far and wide without their help, and they sang as they sang. 14 Of Beleriand and Its Realms This is the fashion of the lands into which the Noldor came, in the north of the regions of Middle-earth, in the ages past, in the ages past. It is also the fashion of the manner in which the chieftains of the Eldar held their lands , in order to protect their leaguer s, after the Dagor Aglareb, the third battle in the era of Beleriand.
