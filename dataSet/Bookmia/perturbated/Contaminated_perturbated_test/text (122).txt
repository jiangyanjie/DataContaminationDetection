a traveller's life is one that is pain amidst them when they get to know that their feelings are on the stretch; and when they try to sink into a storm, Henry finds it difficult to rely on the slurs of the land on which he rests in pleasure . Henry writes new, which again engages his attention, and which also brings inspiration for other novelties. We had scarcely visited the various lakes and forests in England and Westmorland and conceived an affection for many of the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our dear friend approached, and he had left them to travel on. For my own part I was not sorry. I had neglected my grandfather for some time, and I feared the effects of the daemon's slurs might remain in Switzerland and he would never have known his vengeance for their relatives. This took me away from me and tormented me in a moment from now on; they might otherwise have snatched away in peace. I waited for my letters with feverish anticipation that when they were delayed I was miserable and overcome by a thousand of them, and when they arrived and I took the superscription of Elizabeth or my father, I hardly dared to say goodbye to them and say about their fate. Sometimes I thought that the fiend of me didn't go to them, and might expedite my remissness to their names. When these thoughts possessed me I would not quit or leave for a moment, but followed him as his shadow, to protect him from the fancied rage of the world. But I was quite ashamed if I had committed some horrible crime and was ashamed of the consciousness of which haunted me. I was guiltless, but I had indeed drawn down the curse upon my head, as mortal as that of crime.

John was impatient to leave the region of Scotland, and I spent my time; I left Edinburgh in a week, on the banks of Coupar, St. Andrew's, and along the banks of the Atlantic over Perth, where our country and Europe were surrounded by us. But I was in awe that I would never want to laugh and talk to strangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest; and I told Clerval that I wished to make the tour of Ireland where I was going; "Do you," or "enjoy yourself, and let this be the only rendezvous. I may not have a long tour in a year or two; but do not . Whenever I make my way, entreat you; leave me to peace and solitude for a short time; and when I leave the countryside, I hope it will be with a lighter heart, more congenial to your own heart. Henry wished to dissuade me, but seeing me bent on this
