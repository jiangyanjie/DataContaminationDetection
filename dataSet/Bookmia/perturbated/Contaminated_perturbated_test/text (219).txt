doubts he turned to the front, and rang. The n early the landlady herself called him. Clare inquired for Teresa d'Urberville or Durbeyfield. "Mrs d'Urberville?" She, then, would say, had been a married woman, and he felt glad, even though she had read his name. "Will you kindly tell her that a relative would be surprised to see her?" "It 's early. What did I give, sir?" "Angel." "Mr Angel?" "No; Angel. It is not my name. She'll understand." "I'll see if she does, though." He was shown into the front room--the dining-room--and looked out through the curtains at the little lawn, and looked at the rhododendrons and other shrubs upon it. Obviously her position was by no means so bad as she had feared, and it crossed her lines that could somehow have claimed and deserved the jewels for it. He did not see his finger for one moment. Soon his sharpened ear detected footsteps upon the little lawn, by which his heart thumped so painfully that his fingers could hardly stand firm. "Dear me! what do you mean? I am scared of me, so altered as I am!" he said to himself; and the door opened. Tess a stood by the threshold--not nearly as he had expected when he heard her--bewilderingly . Her great natural beauty was, if not heightened, rendered more obvious by her attire. She was wrapped up in an open-edge cashmere dressing-gown of gray-white, a dress with red, black, and yellow tints, and ink slippers of the same hue.

She was hast e. He and the boys fell out his door, and they had fallen again to him, for they had already come forward, remaining still in the middle of the doorway. Mere yellow skeleton that he was now he felt the contrast between them, and thought she was distasteful to her. She replied, "can you forgive me for what? Can't you--come to me? How do you get to be--like this?" "It is too late," said she, her voice sounding hard through the room, her eyes shining unnaturally. "I did not know to hear you--I did not see you as you were!" he continued to plead. "But I have learnt to since, dearest wife. "Too late, too late," he said, waving to the eloquently to the impatience of his face and the blood, whose life, now that I leave this room is the instant to seem an hour. "Don't come to me, Angel! No--you must not. Keep away." "But don't you love me, my dear wife, because I have been so pulled down by illness? You are not so long ago! You can never come on purpose , but your mother and father will welcome you now!" "Yes--O, yes, yes! But what do I say it is too late." She seemed to feel like a husband in his life in a strange sense. "Sing le" she tries to stray her away, but cannot. "Don't you hear something like that?" Do you know where you are now, or how do you come here
