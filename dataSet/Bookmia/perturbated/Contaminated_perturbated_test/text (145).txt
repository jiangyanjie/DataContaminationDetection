returning. -- The part which I acted is now to be explained. -- Our uneasiness had been equally excited with him, but this kind of feeling was soon removed. -- It's not alike sensible . -- For most, if my time was to be lost in detaching their brother, as I was on the run directly in London. -- We saw them by my fingers. -- and so I readily engaged in my office of pointing to a friend, the certain evils of which would have been a choice. -- I hereby enforced them . -- But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed them from being, I am certain of this. -- I suppose I would have prevented the future of him. -- Had it not been seconded by the opinion I am in giving, of your sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return in with sincere, if not with equal, regard. -- Your sister has great natural wit, and he has a stronger dependence on judgment than his own. -- To convince her that he had deceived his sister was no more difficult point.

Of what he has said to you, it is not in the sole discretion of me, ignorant; but in respect of the truth of what he has said to relate, I can summon more than one of those with undoubted merit.
