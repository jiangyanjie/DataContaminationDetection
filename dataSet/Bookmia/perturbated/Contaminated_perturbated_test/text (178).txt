It stood back from a half -foot view into the trees, through which glimpses could be caught of the rocky veranda just around its four sides. The house was approached by gravelled driveways that looked about through wide-spreading lawns and under the edge of tall poplars. At the rear was the roof, where it could be built on even a more spacious scale to the front. There were several great horses in the house, and a dozen grooms and boys held forth, rows of vine-clad servants' fields dubbed against the endless ly narrow array of outhouses, long grape s and pastures, and berry patches. Then there was the pumping plant for the horses to do well, and the big cement tank where Judge Miller's boys took their morning plunge and set their foot on their shoulders in the hot afternoon.
