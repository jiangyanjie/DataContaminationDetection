to be now so concerned about this little thought of his. Besides, it actually makes the body cave in; hence the spirit , and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be. This is the reason most dyspeptic religionists are wrong to give melancholy notions about Religion. In one word, Queequeg, repeated quite digressively; I realized that Christianity was an idea first born on the basis of apple-dumpling; and since then , he had experienced dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans. .. <p ., I then asked him if he himself was ever experiencing a dyspepsia; expressing the idea very strongly enough that he could take it in. He said no; only upon one memorable day, was after a great feast given by the Lord, by the king, on the gaining of power in the battle . The rest of the enemy had been killed by about two thousand in the afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening. No one said anything that will do; for I knew the inferences were without further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who had visited that very island, and he said that it was the first time a lot had been gained there, to start off in a good way.

He and his wife came round with great compliments to all his friends, just as these presents were so many Christmas turkeys. After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon Queequeg. Because, in one word, that he somehow seemed dull of hearing about religion on the subject, unless considered from his point of view; and, in the second place, he did , much more than I thought I could, I would understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and, finally, he no doubt thought I wanted to learn a great deal more about the true religion than I thought. His perspective looked at me with a sort of condescending stance of compassion, as though he thought it was a great pity that a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost in pagan piety. At last we settled in with King and Queequeg, taking a hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the children would not make much profit by reason of their father, we sallied out to board the Pequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut om. <p 87 1 chapter . HIS MARK > In the afternoon, we were all heading towards the dock, driving at the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in . His voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my mistake of a man before, furthermore announcing that he let no further board him unless they previously produced the harpoon. What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?</s> now
