then, the animals had gained that accord, broke and ran out of huts. It was a grinning human skull which looked on them in depth. The dropping of the thing took place from the open , and was so well aimed to work upon their superstitious fears. Thus , Tarzan of the Apes left them with a deep sense of terror and a new manifestation of the presence of some unseen and unearthly evil power , that had been trapped in the gheath of their village. Later, Tarzan discovered a mysterious cauldron, and found that once more their arrows had been planted, a new dawn commenced to dawn upon them . This little man had offended the god by avoiding his village through this part of the jungle without propitiating him. From then on an offering of arrows had been daily placed below a large tree from whence the arrows had disappeared in an effort to conciliate each other, such as that of one. But the seed of fear was deep sown, and had already been planted. The Tarzan of the Apes had laid the foundation for much future misery for himself and his tribe. Thus they were in the forest not far from the village, and early that morning set out slowly , homeward for the afternoon as the sun changed. Only a few berries and an occasional grub worm s were found during the search, and was surprised when, looking up from a log he had been hunting, he saw Sabor, the lioness, standing in the center of the trail not twenty paces away.

With a mighty roar she turned and charged once more; to be met with a third arrow full in one eye; this time she was too scared to go to meet the ape-man , who began to sidestep the onrushing body. Tarzan of the Apes went down beneath the great weight of his enemy, but with gleaming knife drawn and striking home. For a moment they lay there, and then Tarzan realized that the inert force imposed upon him was beyond power ever again to injure man . With the gun wriggled from his great weight, and as he stood and gazed down in his arms and stood the trophy of his skill, a long night of exultation swept over him. With swelling breast, he placed a foot upon the crown of his powerful enemy, and throwing back his fine
