They just twisted into the dark hulk of the old wreck, and they went over to it. Then Julian clutched George's arm and pressed it tightly. "Isn't that not for sure?" he said. "Oh, George, isn't it an extraordinary thing to do?" George said nothing, but stared at the waves in all kinds of thoughts . "Hehe," said her as she turned . "If only the wreck is still mine now it's thrown up ," she said. "I don't know if it belongs to the queen or anyone, like lost treasure does. But after all, the wreck did belong to our queen." "No one bothered much about when it was in the sea- but do you suppose that whoever has still wanted to have it for the time now it's thrown up?" "Well, let's tell ," said Dick. "Don't be silly," said George. "One of the fishermen is sure to see it when his ship goes slipping out of the bay. The news will soon come as more tourists and tourists will be surprised to see it." "Well then, we'd better explore it thoroughly ourselves before anyone else does!" said Dick, eagerly. "No one was sure about it before it went down to us. Can't we explore it just as the wave was rolling a bit?" "We were out of the rocks, if that's what you mean," said George. "We might get there , but we couldn't possibly risk it . It is one of those that got into the boat that made us think the waves are so big. They have seen today, that's certain. The wind is still going down today." "Well, what about tomorrow ?" said Dick. "What about when we got to know about the ship?" "I would bet if only we can get into the ship first, I have to find anything there is to find!" "Yes, I expect we could," said George. "I told them all that we had been down and can't get into the ship as long as they could- but of course, it is difficult to do that properly ." We have only found something we can't find." Oh, I would like to go down. I 'm sure it's true that my old friend could come up from the bottom of the sea like that!" The sun was now dark, the children's wet clothes dried up by the hot rays. They kept shining out over the sun, but the wind and Tim's coat sent him into a mist too. He didn't seem to like the wreck at all, but growled deeply at it. "You are funny, Tim," he said patting him. "It won't hurt you! What do you think it is?" "He said, it's a whale," George said, laughing with a laugh. "Oh, it is the most exciting story in my life! Oh, can't we possibly dive up our boat and see if we can dive a blown gas wreck?" "I don't know if we can't," said George. "I only wish it was a whale," said George. But it's quite impossible, Anne. For one , I don't think the wreck has quite settled down on the rocks yet, and it won't till the water has gone down. I keep it lifting a little still when an extra big wave comes. It would be a pleasure to go
