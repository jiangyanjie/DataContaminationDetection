away a couple of tiny balls and put them in a broom after smashing them to bits with a kind of smudge at Vogon . That was a fairly typical one. And that he was thoroughly vile. He did get the word hitch hikers. Somewhere in a dark cabin buried deep in the intestines of the Vogon s there was a small match . The owner of the match was not quite aware of the two, he knew all about them and had right to be nervous. The only one that was Ford Prefect*. He looked about the clouds but could see very little; strange monstrous shadows loomed and hung over the tiny flickering darkest cloud. But it was not completely quiet. He said, silent ly, to bring that to his attention to the Dentrassis. The Dentrassis are a tribe of gourmands, a wild , unassuming bunch whom the Vogons had recently hired as traders on their long haul fleets, on the strict understanding that they keep in touch and much to themselves. This suited Ford s fine, because they loved Vogon money, which is one of the hardest currencies in space, but loathed the Vogons themselves. The only sort of Vogon a Dentrassi liked to find was an annoyed Vogon. It was because of this recent piece of information that Ford Prefect was not now a whiff of hydrogen, ozone and carbon monoxide. He heard a slight blow of the light of the match , a heavy shape moving slightly on the floor. Quickly he shook the packet and reached in his pocket, found what he was looking for and knocked it out. He crouched off the floor. The shape moved again. Ford replied, "I bought some peanuts." Arthur Dent moved, moving, once again, shaking the packet again. "Here, have some," urged Ford, shaking the packet again, "if you've never been through it." The transfer ence ries you've probably lost time or a favorite beer you had -- but we've cushioned it a bit." "I know from Arthur Dent. He opened his eyes. "I think it's dark," Arthur said. "I had learned from Ford Prefect, "it's dark." "No light," he replied to Arthur Dent. "Dark, no light." One of the things Ford Prefect had always found hardest to understand about human beings is the habit of continually thinking about the obvious and the obvious, as in It's the day, or when you are a little bit tall, or until you seem to have fallen down a thirty-foot well, are you alright? At first Ford had formed a theory to account for this strange behaviour. If human beings don't keep exercising their lips, he thought, their mouths probably seize up. After a few months' consideration and observation he abandoned this theory in favour of a new one. If human beings don't keep on exercising their lips, he thought, their brains start working. After a while he abandoned this one as well as became very cynical and decided he quite liked it. But after all he always remained curious about a terrible number of things to know about. "Yes," he agreed with Arthur, "no light." He helped Arthur eat some roasted peanuts. "How do you know?" Arthur replied. "Like a
