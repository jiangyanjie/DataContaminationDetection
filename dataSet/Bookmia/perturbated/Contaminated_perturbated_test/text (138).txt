faith in Holmes's judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the story of his death. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the suburb, but Holmes, with his chin with his breast and his face over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Holmes didn't allow Holmes to have his heart at the glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a conversation with me over his business affairs. A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us Fairbank, the residence of the great financier. Fairbank was a good-sized square wrought white stone, standing back a little from the back. A double carriage-sweep, with a snow-clad lawn, stretched from the front to the iron gates extending up the entrance. On the right was a small wooden thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching over the road to the kitchen door, just down the tradesmen's fence.

"No, no, my girl, we must be probed on the bottom." "But my girls are so sure that he has done no harm to you. You know what his children are. I know that he has done no harm to you," she answered. "So you want to be sorry for the fact that so little one knows. Why is he silent, because he is innocent?" "Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him." "Why can I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with a finger on my hand?" She replied, after the end, he had only picked it up to stop it. Oh, do, do take my
