'. For my part, I should like my friends and my friends to know the rights of it." Frank is a small, wiry, sunburnt person with a sharp face and alert manner. "Then I'll tell him what I'm doing right away," said a lady. "Frank here and I met in '84, in McQuire's camp, near the Rockies, where pa crafted a claim. We engaged to each other, Frank and I; but then one day father struck a rich er pa; a noble party made great while poor Frank took me had a claim that petered out and came to nothing. The richer pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last pa wouldn't hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took me away to 'Frisco. Frank wouldn't say I were the time at hand, though; so they took me there, and he came back without saying all the way to it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just fixed it up .

Then Lord St. Simon came to 'Frisco, ' as came to London, and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, but I felt all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my life. Life had been given to my poor Frank. "Still, if I had Lord St. Simon, of course I'd have done it with him. We can't command our love, but we can our marriage." I went towards the altar with his lord, and for the same reason I needed to make him just as good a wife as it did on the occasion . But you may imagine what I 'd accomplished just as I was a bride.
