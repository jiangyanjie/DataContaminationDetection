"I must find it." At first I was already fending for myself. No, my friend, I am not too young. A chick that will grow into an egg can be spotted the very day it hatches. I have done nothing. I hope to see it grow into a man, but there is too much of his mother in him." "Too much of his mother was on his thought, and I did not say it. The same thought also came to Okonkwo's mind. But he had not decided to lay that ghost. Whenever the thought of his father's weakness and weakness came to him he expelled it by thinking about his own life. His success. And Okonkwo did now. His life will get closer to his latest peak in manliness. "I know why someone had not allowed me to come with us . But I must tell that boy," he asked Obierika. "Because I could not say it, Obierika replied . "I had something better to do." "You sound as if you question the authority and the decision of the Oracle, who said he should die." "I do not. Why should I? But the Oracle did not ask me to answer any decision." "But someone had to do it. If we were scared of blood, it would be true, but what do you think of what the Oracle would do ?" "We all know ," said Okonkwo, that I am not afraid of blood and if I are saying you that I am not afraid of blood, ask with you what I think is telling me. Let me tell you one thing, my friend. If I were you , we have stayed at home. What you have said does not please the Earth. It is the kind of action which the goddess wipes out whole families."

It was clear with twinkling eyes that this was an important news. But it would be the reason he could rush him. This gave him a glance at the box and opened the door to explain what he had broken with Okonkwo. I opened up slowly and talked about the issue. As he finished his kola nut he said: "The things in this world these days are very strange." "What has happened?" asked Okonkwo. "Do you know Ogbuefi Ndulue?" Ofoedu asked. "Ogbuefi Ndulue of Ire village," Okonkwo and Obierika said. "He died this morning," said Ofoedu. "That is pretty strange and we told Ogbuefi Ndulue the oldest guy in Ire and was the oldest man in Ire," said Obierika. "You are right," Ofoedu agreed. "But you ought to ask why the drum has not hit and tell Umuofia of his death." "I know Obierika and Okonkwo together. "That is the strange part of that." "Do you know Obierika? You know his first wife who walks with a stick?" "Yes. She is called Ozoemena." "To do so,"
