Christmas as we are." "A "Chapter" I.3 The Laurence Boy " "Is There Anything About You? Where are you?" cried Meg at the foot of the garret 's window, answered a little questions from above, and, running up, Meg , a good sister , and crying over the HEIR OF REDCLYFFE, wrapped up in a comforter on an uncomfortable sofa by the sunny window. This was Jo's favorite refuge, and here she wants to retire , a dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy the quiet and the society of a pet home. Noone was near by , and she gave to mind her a particle. As Meg appeared, he pulled into his hole. Jo , holding tears off her shoulders, waited to hear the news. "Such fun!
