In front of the wall, farmers stood beside their feet, shouting out, "Apples, the best to be at twice the price," and "Blood melons, sweet as honey," and "Turnips, onions, roots, here you go , here you go, turnips, onions, seeds, here you go, here you go." The entrance to the Gate of Steel, and a black belt of the City Watchmen stood with portcullis in their jacket on spears. While a column of riders appeared from its foot traffic, the guardsmen sprang into action, shouting commands and moving the carts and foot traffic aside to let the knight enter with his hamster.
