a scrape d of Giles.' 'I know. I don't mean to say, sir,' said Mr. Giles, trembling, 'that he's going to be here.' If I thought it, I would never be happy about it; wouldn't that be a boy to not even Brittles here; not for all the plate in the box?' 'That's not the point,' said the doctor, mysteriously. 'Mr. Giles, are you a Protestant?' 'Yes, sir, I hope that Mr. Giles had gone out of place to be very pale. 'And what are YOU, boy?' said the doctor, turning sharply upon Brittles. 'Lord bless me, Mr. Giles, Sir, Brittles, ' said the doctor. 'I'm the one and you are Mr. Giles, sir.' 'Then tell me this,' said the doctor, and 'I'm one of you, both of you! Are you going to take upon yourselves a whole office when that little is the boy that was in the little window last night? Out with it! Come! We 're here for you!' The doctor, who was universally considered as one of the best-tempered in the earth, made this demand into a dreadful tone and attempt to show that Giles and Brittles, who were considerably muddled by ale and excitement, had encountered each other in a state of stupefaction.

There were no light coming to that very same house, next morning, where he happens to fall asleep; with his own arms drawn up, these men lay violent hands upon him--by doing which, they place his life in danger--and swear he is the owner of their home. When the question is, whether these men are justified in fact; if not, in what situation do they place themselves?' The constable nodded profoundly. He said, if it wasn't law, he would be glad to know what was. 'I ask you, how thundered the doctor, 'Can you place on your oaths, able to hold a boy?' looked doubtfully at Mr. Giles; Mr. Giles looked out at Brittles; the constable waited, looking at the doctor's hand behind his ear, to catch the reply; the two men watched. He looked into the scene; the constable leaned forward to listen; the doctor glanced keenly round; the ring was heard of gate, and at the same moment, the sound of wheels.
