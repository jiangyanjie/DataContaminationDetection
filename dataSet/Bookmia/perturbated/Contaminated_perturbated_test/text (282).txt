have resumed their lives. You seem to have begun returning to yourself. And yet you are still happy, and you still avoid the urge to follow your dreams. For some time I was lost in conjecture as to the history of this, but yesterday 's experience struck me, and though it is well founded, I'll ask you to avow it.
