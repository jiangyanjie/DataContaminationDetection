down the court. Master Bates, giving the Jew thoughtful countenance. The man, a man of footsteps on the creaking stairs, a few minutes after the end of this conversation, greeted the merry Jew as he sat over the fire of saveloy , the small loaf in his hand; a pocket-knife in the face, and a pot on the trivet. There was a slight smile on his white face as he turned round, and looking sharply out from under his head. Fagin bent his eyebrows, bent his ear slid across the door, and listened. 'Why, how's this?' muttered the Jew: changing countenance; 'only two of 'em? Where's the boy?' said him. They can't have got into trouble. Having crossed footsteps , they were landing. The door was slowly opened; and Me and Charley , closing it , stepping. CHAPTER XIII . ACQUAINTANCES ARE INTRODUCED IN INTELLIGENT READER, CONNECTED WITH WHOM VARIOUS PLEASANT MATTERS ARE RELATED, APPERTAINING TO THIS HISTORY 'Where's Oliver?' said the Jew, rising with a menacing look. 'Where's the boy?' The young thieves approached each other, beating the preceptor as if they were an adult, and his boys looked uneasily at each other. But there was no reply. 'What's the boy about the boy?' said the Jew, seizing the Dodger tightly by the collar, and threatening him with horrid imprecations. 'Speak out, or say. Thank you!' Mr. Fagin looked so very much in earnest, with Master Bates, who thought he would be prudent in all cases to look on his side, and who conceived of him by no means improbable that it might be his head. 'But o' me?" be gged back to the Jew, and leaned toward his knees, and began to hurl on that loud, well-sustained, and continuous roar--something between a mad bull and a speaking trumpet. 'Will you speak?' thundered the Jew: shaking the Dodger so well. He, keeping in the big coat at the point of passing, turned the Dodger toward his face and he was perfectly miraculous. 'Why, the traps are in front of him, and that's all ," said the Dodger, sullenly. 'Come, let go o' me, will you!' And, swinging himself, at one jerk, in the face of the big coat, which had poured on the Jew's hands, the Dodger snatched up the door and made a pass at the merry old gentleman's waistcoat; which, if it had taken an hour, would have let a little more merriment out, but would have been easily replaced. The Jew stepped back in an emergency, with more agility than it had been anticipated in a man of very decrepitude; and, when Bates turned into a pot, prepared to hurl on his assailant's head. When Bates, at this moment, calling his attention by a terrific howl, he suddenly reached his next destination, and flung it full at that young gentleman. 'Why, what the blazes is in the blaze?' growled a deep voice. 'Who pitched that on ? But well I got a beer, or I could have thrown off the pot, as hit ? I'd have settled somebody. I might have know'd, as nobody but the rich, plundering, that the Jew could afford to throw away any drink but water--and not that, unless
