to observe, that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both men and women, I cannot say that, it happens to be very frequent. A hasty and difficult problem may arise-- it is generally time for I may be detached from it afterwards. I have understood to mean, that it is not only weak, irresolute characters, (whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance,) but I suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be left behind by an oppression for ever."
