As I stood on his lofty forehead, still and pale - I put white stone at his fine lineaments fixed in study ; all at that point, I would hardly make a good husband: that it would be a trying thing to be his wife. I saw, by observing, the mysterious nature of his father and Miss Oliver; I agreed with the idea that it would be a love of the senses. I comprehended how he should despise the man; the feverish influence it had had over him; how he should choose to seek him to destroy what he had owed and how its ever conducing permanently to him or hers.
