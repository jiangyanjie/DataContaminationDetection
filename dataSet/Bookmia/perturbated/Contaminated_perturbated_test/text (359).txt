loveliness and a gentle encouragement to admiration, her conversation was a chill to repartee. Archer soon abandoned the naive-manure, but the tutor, who s most fluent and accomplished English, was forced to pour it out to her until the ladies, to the ears of the poor, went up to the centre. Archer, on a glass of port, was obliged to come to a bed, and the shy nephew, who appeared to be an invalid, was put to bed. But he never had to wait to see the tutor s sit over their knees and suddenly Archer found himself talking as he had not done since his last symposium with Ned Winsett. The Carfry nephew, which he carried out, had been threatened with consumption, so Archer had to leave Harrow town, where he worked for two to three years with the milder air of the newspaper. Being a bookish youth, he had been entrusted to M. Riviere, who had brought him back to his hometown and had promised to remain with him till he went to Oxford the following spring; and M. Riviere, who possessed a premise with simplicity that he should then be forced to look out for another job. It was, Archer thought, that life would be long , and so many his interests and so many his gifts. He was a man of about forty years, and was a thin character (May would certainly have called him common-looking) to which the play and some ideas gave an intense expressiveness; but there was nothing frivolous or cheap in his animation. His son had a career that had been quite small , and it would have been intended that the son should follow the same career; but an insatiable taste of his work was that he had mastered the art of the young man into journalism, then into authorship (apparently unsuccessful), and he escaped other experiments and vicissitudes which he spared his listener--into tutoring English youths in Switzerland. Before that, Archer had lived much more and frequented the Goncourt ; and advised by Maupass had chosen to attempt to write (even that seemed to Archer a dazzling surprise) but had always lived with Merimee in his house. He had obviously always been desperately poor and anxious about the mother and an elderly, and so, the wife (which he was in for), as it had been difficult to imagine; but his literary genius and passion failed. His writing, in fact, seemed, materially speaking, no more brilliant than Ned Winsett's; but he had lived in a world in which, as he said, one who loved ideas had worked . At the time it was because of that genuinely poor Winsett 's son died, and, following his death, Archer had witnessed a sort of vicarious envy at this eager impecunious young man who had fared so richly in his poverty. "You see, something worth everything, isn't it, to keep one's intellectual liberty, not to enslave one's powers to one's critical independence? It was because of that ," Archer said. "I abandoned journalism, and took a much duller work: tutoring and private secretaryship. There is a good racial drudgery, of course; but one preserves one's moral freedom,
