cannot consider your situation with much hope that he returns no more , so my choice will never be required. A thousand orders can arise in six months!'' The idea of his returning no longer was treated with the utmost contempt. It was for her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes, and it did not seem at the moment suppose that her friend could however openly or artfully think he was a young man , the father of every one. She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she would be wishing on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of the friends overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and to meet the wish of her heart.
