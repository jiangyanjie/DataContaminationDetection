simple and direct, although Mr. Stapleton who had no means in the beginning of knowing the motives of his actions is not only learn t from the facts, it all appeared exceedingly complex. I have had a series of two conversations with Mrs. Stapleton, however the matter has now been so complex that I am not aware that there is anything which has remained a secret to us. You will find a brief article upon the matter under the heading B in the list on this issue. "Perhaps , kindly give me some examples of the course of events from memory." "Certainly, though I cannot guarantee that I carry all the facts in my mind. Intense mental concentration has a curious way of blotting out what has happened to me," said the barrister who has never been given his word on her fingers' ends and is able to argue with an opportunistic audience.
