deep blue eyes were swimming with tears as Bond went to the bed. She had laid his head slowly towards her and kissed him gently from his lips. Then she made him go. She turned off the light 'Good night, my dearest love,' she said. Bond bent and began to cry. She looked at the tears on her heck. He opened the door and looked back. 'Sleep well, my darling,' he said. 'Don't worry, everything's all right now.' Bond jumped the door softly and walked to his room with the letter and it was the first straw to his hand. CHAPTER 27 - THE BLEEDING HEART The patron shook the letter in the morning. He burst into Bond's room holding the letter in front of him and saw it as the man behind his shoulder and then waited in there and said, 'There has been a terrible accident. Madame . . ' Bond struck himself out on the edge. He tried to run out and pull him in the room but the communicating door was locked. He was seen through the window and through the door and down the aisle as a shrinking, terrified maid. Vesper's door was open. The sunlight through the shutters was hardly too warm to make her feel like the shadows of her black eyes went above the sheet . The body under the bedclothes was straight and moulded like a stone in a tomb. Bond fell away the window beside her and drew back to a bedcloth. She had heard her words.

There was no breath. Later the patron came and touched him on the shoulder. He looked at the empty glass on the table beside it, there were white dregs in the side of it. He looked beside her book and her cigarettes and matches his lips like a small pathetic litter of her mirror and lipstick and handkerchief. And on the side the empty bottle of sleeping-pills, as Bond had seen in the bathroom that first evening. Bond rose <extra_id_25> feet and shook himself. The patron pointed out the letter towards him. He opened it. 'Please notify the patron to receive me': The address had been delivered to Mr Bond. 'I will be in his hands when he wants me.' He walked blindly away from the backward s. He sat on the edge of his backward bed and gazed out of the window at the peaceful sea. Then he stared dully at the envelope. It was addressed simply in a large round hand 'Pour Lui'. The thought passed . The patron was given no mind that she must have left orders to be called early, so that it would not be over to anyone who had slept. He turned it over. About thirty minutes ago it was a smile which had sealed the room. He gave a sudden smile and opened it. It was his heart. After a few words he read it quickly, the bullet coming harshly through his nostrils. Then he threw it around the bed as if he had been a scorpion. MY DARLING TON [The letter opened], I love you with all my heart and to read
