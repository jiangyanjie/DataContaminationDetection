definition of God, He will never leave to let go." "The Man is many things, but he is not . I am glad he is alive and alive at all: though I wish you chaps would not squabble over anything and hear nothing." You had to have you have it, the name of your silly boy doesn't really exist, and I hope you could not see this picture without you! You could have it ." "Good news Basil, I will never have any of you," cried Dorian Gray. "I don't allow people to make it a silly boy." "You know the picture is yours, Dorian. I gave it to you before it existed." "And you know you are a little silly, Mr. Gray, and that you wouldn't mind being called a boy." "You will never have minded very much this morning, Lord Henry." "Ah! this morning! You have minded much then." There came a knock to the door, and the butler s removed the tea- tray and set it down upon the Japanese table.
