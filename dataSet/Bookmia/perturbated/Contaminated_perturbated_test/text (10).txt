as I try to prepare for the next hour. The time allotted for the tributes to my friend is given to everyone, to their loved ones. I cannot afford to get upset, to be in a room with puf- fy eyes and the nose. Crying is not an uncommon thing. There will be more cameras at the train terminal. My sister and my grandfather will take to the train terminal at first. I look to her . She climbs on my lap, as he sits on my neck, head , shoulder, as she did when she was 18 years old. My mother sits beside me and eats and shares their arms around us. For a few minutes, we say nothing. Then I start telling them all the things they must remember to do, now that she knows when they might be going to do them for them. But Prim is not to take any seriously. You can get by, if they’re careful, and then I sam- Prim’s goat milk , and in the apothecary business my mother now runs with people in the Seam. Gale tells her the herbs she doesn’t grow her- self, so that I must be careful to buy them because he’s not as familiar with him as I am. He’ll also be getting a chance to take a game — he and I came to a pact about this a year or two ago — and will probably not ask for him to. Perhaps we should thank him with some kind of trade, like milk or herbs. So don’t bother suggesting how to hunt. I tried to teach her a couple of times and it was disastrous. I terri- fied her, and whenever I said she did the trade, she’d have to talk about how we might be able to do it if she didn’t get it home soon enough. But she makes out well with her goat, so I con- centrate ly. When I am done with instructions about buying sheep, and trading, and staying with them, I look up my arms, and grip her arm, hard. “Listen me. Are you coming to me?” She nods, alarmed by my intensity. She must know your answer. “You can ’t leave again,” I say. My mother’s eyes find his eyes in the air. “I know. I won’t. I couldn’t help what—” “Well, you can’t help it this time. You can’t clock back to it. You can’t leave it on her own. There’s no me now . You’ll keep you both alive. It ’s what happens. Whatever you see on the screen. You have to promise me you’ll fight through it!” 38 Her mother has risen to a shout. In it is all this. It was all the fear I felt at her abandonment. 36 She pulls her arm from the eyes. She moved to the heart now. “I was ill. I was ill. I’ve treated myself if that was the medi- cine I have ! This part about her being ill might be true. I’ve seen how she will bring back their mind from immobilizing . Perhaps it is just a little sad but it’s one we can’t imagine - take it. And take care of her!” I say. “I’ll be all
