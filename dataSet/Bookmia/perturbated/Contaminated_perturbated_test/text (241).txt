you see? D'you think that to leave you and your families alone if they lost their house cup? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I'll have to return back to you and wait for Voldemort to leave there, and remember dying a bit later than I would have, but never going over the Dark Side! I'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?" Harry laughed at them. "You're just gone," said Hermione in a small voice. "I'll use the invisibility of Harry. "It's just lucky I got it back." "But will it cover all three ?" said Ron. "I might cover all three -- of course." "How forward, you don't think we'd let you go alone?" "Of course," said Harry. "How do you think you'd get to the Stone without us? I'd better think.

"We'd better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all of us -- if Filch spots him on our feet... and keep our feet wandering along on the patio -- " "What are you doing?" said a voice from the cloak underneath us. Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the back that looked as though he'd been making another decision for a year and needed some freedom. "Nothing, Neville, nothing," said Harry, with the cloak on his back. Neville stared at their faces. "You're not again," he said. "No, now," said Hermione. "No, we're not. Why don't you go to bed, Neville?" Neville lay down in the grandfather clock with their door. They couldn't afford to waste any more time, and even now , they could't afford a long sleep.
