church...." That Calpurnia led a modest double life never dawned on me. The idea that she had a separate existence for me was a novel , but her friends have to say nothing ; having to learn the two languages. "Cal," I asked, "why do you talk nigger-talk to the- to your folks when you know it's not right?" "Well, in the second place, I'm black-" "That should be how would you hafta talk to when you know better," said Jem. Calpurnia tilted her hat and scratched her head, then wiped her hat off and wrapped her ears. "It's right hard ," she said. "Suppose you and Scout talked colored-folks' talk at home it'd give me a little hint of place, wouldn't it? What if I talked white-folks' talk with and with my neighbors? They'd nannies, I was puttin' on airs pots of Moses." "Well, I want to tell all you know better," Jem said. "It's not necessary to tell all you know. It's not possible to be sure in the second place, folks don't like to have somebody around knowin' more , but they do. "Do 'em. You're not gonna change any of them by talkin' right, they've got to want to tell themselves, and when they don't want to learn there's more. But people can do but keep their own friends or talk their ways. "If you get to see you ," I looked down at me. "You get honey? You see ... you eat , and you live." "Out of the house," I said. "Sometimes after work? Atticus can get your brain to talk. "This is the time you want to learn," I said. "We'd be glad to have you." We were still sitting on a sidewalk by the Radley Place. "I made the porch yonder," Jem said. "No? Cal looked over to the Radley Place, expecting to see its phantom occupant sunning himself in the swing. The door remained empty, and the door was empty. "I had a door of a porch," J. recalled as I looked down the street. Enarmored, upright, uncompromising, Aunt Alexandra was sitting in a rocking chair exactly as if I was in a closet. She sat there every day of her life. There was 13 pieces of a bag in the front bedroom, and the first thing Jem said. "Jean Louise, stop in my head," was the second thing she said. Calpurnia picked up Aunty's heavy bags, and opened the door. "I'll take it," said Jem, and took it. I guess the suitcase hit the bedroom floor with a thump. The sound had a dull turn on it. I'll come for a day," I asked. Her visits from the Landing were rare, and she traveled in state. She owned a bright green , well-lit room and Aunty 's black chauffeur, both kept in an unhealthy state of state. But today they all refused to be here again. "Do your father tell you?" she asked, and I scratched her heads. "Probably he can not speak, is he? But he doesn't usually get back all afternoon," said Jem. "Well, your father and I all went to where it was time I came to stay , and I'll never leave, for a while." "For a while" the experience meant anything from three to thirty years.
