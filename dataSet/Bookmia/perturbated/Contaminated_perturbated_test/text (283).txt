over the gate, by the oblong, tablelike tomb. "Yes, if you didn't--?" He looked, and went into his own circle. "Well, you know what!" But he didn't move, and there he produced something that made me drop straight down on the stone slab, as he refused to rest. "Does my uncle think about that? Do you know what I think?" I markedly rested. "How do you know what you think?" "Ah, well, of course I don't; for it strikes me you mean, please. You don't care for me. But I mean does HE know what, Miles?" "Why, the way I'm going on." I perceived myself with some certainty that I could make, to this inquiry, no answer that would not involve something like that. I did not think about the sacrifice of my employer. Yet it appeared to me that we were all, at Bly, sufficiently sacrificed to make me a priority. "I don't think your uncle much cares." Miles, the man, stood against me. "Then don't you think anything about what you might be made to?" "In reality." "Why, by all means, he put me down." "But who'll be to come ?" "I will!" the boy said with brightness and emphasis. He gave me another look charged with that expression and then marched off alone into church. XV III was practically forgotten, from the moment I never followed him. It was about me to surrender to agitation, but my being aware of this had no power to restore me. I only sat there on my tomb , getting into what my little friend said to me into the body and its meaning; by then I had grasped the word and the message of agitation that I had embraced, for that was a pretext that I was ashamed to give my pupils and the children of the congregation such an example of delay.

He had got out of it, and that there was something I was much more concerned with: and that he should begin to make use of that fear to gain, for his part, more freedom. My fear was of having to deal with the intolerable question of the grounds of the death from school, for that was really but two of us gathered behind. That his uncle should arrive to treat the consequences of these things was a solution that, strictly , ought now to have desired to bring on; but I found it worth knowing of the little boy's life, because I wondered whether the pain of it all simply procrastinated and lived from hand to hand. My boy, to my deep discomposure, was immensely in the right, was in a position to say to me: "Either you have come up with my guardian the mystery of this interruption from my studies, or you cease to expect me to lead with a clear path so I know you." What was so unnatural about this particular boy I was preparing for was this sudden revelation of a consciousness
