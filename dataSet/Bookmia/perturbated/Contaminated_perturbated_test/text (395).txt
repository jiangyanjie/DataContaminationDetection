but ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, looked on a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and returned a letter. The photograph , which I found on the Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to "Sherlock Holmes, will be left till called for." My friend and I hung the photograph open and we all three read it . It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in my eyes. MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You wrote it very well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had no suspicion. But when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to look at you again. I had been warned against you months ago. I was told that if the King had been a loyal agent it would lead to you. And your address had been given me. Yet, from this, you made me feel all you could know. Even after I became suspicious, I felt like you managed to think of you as such a dear, kind old woman. By the way I know, I have been afraid of being sent to actress myself. Male costume is nothing that will fit me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran up stairs, and wore your walking-clothes, as I call it. Not came as easy as you , so I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I had been an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. I, rather imprudently, wished you . I then started for a while and wanted to speak with my husband. We were all set to the best of their flight, when pursued by the King. And I am an antagonist; so you will find your nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may be in your peace. I love and am loved by some of my readers. The better man is better. The better man is better. And it can do what I am afraid of, without hindrance from one another. So the better man has cruelly wronged. I keep it with safeguard myself, and to a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I keep a photograph which I care to possess; I still remain, Sir Sherlock Holmes, Very proud and very grateful for his bravery," said Mr. NORTON, nee ADLER. "What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. "Did I tell you how quick and reliable she was? Would she have made an admirable queen? Is it a pity that she was not on my level?" "From what I have read out of the image, the Queen seems indeed to be at a very different level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's business to more great lengths." "On my level - I am able to do this sir," cried the King; it might be more successful. I wish that her word was heard in a more accurate way. The photograph is now as safe
