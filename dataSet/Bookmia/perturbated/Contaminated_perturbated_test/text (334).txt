saying to myself, I'm not happy, so I'm not happy." "I am." He looked up and beamed. "And proud ." "I'm going to do something," said Montag. "I don't even know what to do, but I'm going to do something." "I'm tired of listening to this ." Mildred, turning from the door to the announcer , touched the volume of the room of the time the door was gone. He paused. "This is your house , just as beautiful as it is. I feel it's only fair that I tell you now. I should have told you it was like I wasn't even saying to myself. I have a house I want you to see, something I've put away and hid during the past year, now and once in a while, I didn't know why, but I did it and I never told you."
