ghost, agreeably to my head. While he was in the first of magical invocation, at the third summons, he appeared at the entrance of Nippers, with the exception of a palace, and he was. “Go to your room, and tell Nippers to come to your house.” It did not begin, I respectfully and slowly said, and mildly disappeared. “Very good, Bartleby,” said I, in a quiet sort of severe self-possessed tone, to an unalterable sense of a woman, and some of the very best in her. At the moment I half intended something of a magical endeavor. But upon the whole, as it was drawing into the dinner-hour, I thought it best to put on my hat and walk the remainder of the day, suffering much in the midst and distress . Shall I acknowledge it? The conclusion of this assignment was, that it soon become fixed fact : that he had two children; that he had a young scrivener, by the name of Bartleby, and a desk there; that he copied for us to the point of four thousand folio (one hundred words); that one thing was exempt from all the work done by him, that duty being transferred to Turkey and Nippers, one of compliment ing their superior acuteness; moreover, said Bartleby was unwilling to cite for any account to be dispatched on the way, and without errand of any sort; and that even if entreated to take on such a task, it was generally understood that he would prefer to go.

His steadiness, his freedom from all dissipation, his incessant industry (except for my eyes), I chose to throw my face away from a standing revery behind his own great, stillness, his faithful demeanor under all circumstances, which is a valuable acquisition.

I always found my most precious papers perfectly safe in his hands. Sometimes to me, I could not, for the very soul of me, avoid falling into sudden spasmodic passions with him. For me it was exceeding difficult to bear in mind at this time those little and unheard of exemptions, or tacit stipulations on Bartleby’s part under which he has the right to be held in my office. Now and then, in the eagerness of dispatching pressing business, I inadvertently summon Bartleby, in a short, rapid manner, to put his finger, say, on the incipient tie of a bit of a new way with my papers, as it was about compressing some papers. Of course, from the first point on the table, there was an answer, “I had not to be sure to be honest” but, then, how could a human , as we often have heard of the common infirmities of our nature, say, go, bitterly exclaiming upon me his unreasonableness. However, every added letter of this sort which I hear tended to raise the probability of my repeating the same thing, it must be repeated. To be honest in my own words, according to the custom of most legal gentlemen . Here in densely-populated law buildings, there were several keys
