mother and by running in and having slept for the first time she was going to get a treat she had done in frocks "full of that". But she was not there any more. "You 'll have to see him, because this one you won't," said Mrs. Medlock. "And you mustn't expect that there will be somebody trying to talk to you. So you've to play about and do the magic yourself.
