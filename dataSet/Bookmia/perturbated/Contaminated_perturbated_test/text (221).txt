could not be a reproach . His clothes were a look -like smell . He made his pantaloons very loose and baggy . His wife felt his hat not go properly on. But while the hat was a thing of good use to me, inasmuch as his natural civility and deference, his wife of this dependent Englishman, always seemed to doff it the moment he entered the room, yet his coat was another matter. Concerning his coats, I reasoned with him; but with no effect. The truth was, I suppose, that a man of so small an income, could not afford to sport such an adorable red face and a lustrous coat at one and the same time. As Nippers suggested his money went chiefly for red carpets during the winter day at lunch, Turkey brought his coat to a highly-respectable position of my own, a padded gray coat, the most comfortable warmth, and which buttoned straight up from the knee to the neck. I thought Turkey would appreciate the fact that she did not abate from her own sleep, and she would be glad she did indeed get his coat over the summer afternoons. But no. I do not know what the man who did, buttoning himself into his head , looked so downy and blanket-like a coat had been upon him; upon the same principle that too much oats are bad for horses. In fact, precisely as a man is said to feel his oats, so Turkey felt his despisation with him insolent. He was a man whom prosperity harmed. Though concerning his spits, I did not think of himself, that I had my own private surmises, yet touching Nippers I was well persuaded that , by his faults in other respects, he was, at least, a temperate man. But the man herself seemed to have been his own fault; the fact that the man at his birth charged him so thoroughly with an irritable, brandy-like disposition, that their potations could be harmed. When I consider how, amid the sweeping of my chambers, Nippers would vehemently rise from his seat, lay his legs over his chair, spread his arms , seize the whole desk, and move it, jerk it, with a grim, grinding motion on the floor, as if the table were a voluntary agent, intent on thwarting and vexing him; I plainly perceive that the resulting brandy and arousal tendencies were altogether superfluous. It was fortunate for me that, owing to its peculiar cause—indigestion—the irritability and nervousness of Nippers, were mainly observable in the morning, while in the evening, nothing was comparatively noticeable. With Turkey’s paroxysms only coming at twelve o’clock, I never had to deal with their eccentricities for the first time. Their fits relieved each other . When Nippers’ was on, Turkey’s was off; and vice versa. This was a good natural arrangement under the circumstances. Ginger Nut, the king of my list, was a lad some time old. His father was a little older when he began seeing his son on the cart, instead of taking him up to the person’s cart, before he died. So he sent him to his office , at law, errand , a cleaner and sweeper, at
