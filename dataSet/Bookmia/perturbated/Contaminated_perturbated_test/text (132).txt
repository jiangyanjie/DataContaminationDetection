amber of the Whiskey? I have no idea. My leg is crossed at the head and his right arm is crossed at the bottom of his knee. He’s wearing black socks and dress shoes. His right el- bow goes over the back of his chair, his hand up to his chin, and he’s slowly , his index finger rhythmically back and forth over his lower chest. I hear the early morn- ing light, his eyes burn with grave intensity but his general expression is com- pletely unreadable. My heart almost stops. He’s here. How did he get here? He must have left New York City last night. How long has he been watching me sleep? “Hi,” I whisper. He regards me and his heart stutters . Oh no. He takes his long fingers away from his heart and back the door. He loves his drink, and places the glass on the table. I half expect him to talk about me, but he doesn’t. He moves back, continuing to regard me, his expression impassive. “Hello,” he says finally, his voice hushed. And I know he’s still way beyond mad. But, I can do my best to keep him from thinking. “It would appear so.” 211/551 Slowly I pull myself up into a sitting position, not taking my eyes off him. My fingers were dry. “How long have you been sitting there watching you sleep?” “Long enough.” “You’re still alone. I can hardly speak the words. He gazes at me as if considering it. “Mad,” he says as if testing the word, its words, its nuances, its colors and its words. Ana. I can’t imagine me way beyond mad.” “May sound good. I can’t swallow, but it’s still a dry . I know he’s yet beyond mad . . . that sounds very good.” “The words are still looking at me, completely different,” he doesn’t respond. This silence stretches me over to the side. I reach over to my glass of water and take , a sip, trying to keep your erratic heart rate under control. Now, I try a bit more of something and I place my glass beside him at the bedside table. “I know,” I say icily. Of course, he knows. “Are you going to be monosyllabic for long?” His eyebrows move fractionally registering his surprise as if he hadn’t done this until he pushed to a few feet. Oh ,. ... What to do with your best form of life? “Why is it sorry I stayed out.” “Are you a kid?” I mutter after a pause, so far the same one as true. “Why say it then?” “Because I scream you will be mad at me.” He sighs heavily as if he’s been holding this tension for a thousand hours and runs his hand through his hair. He looks unreal but beautiful. I drink him in—Christian’s back—angry, but I laugh at him as if I did an entire piece. “I think Detective Clark wants to kill you.” “I’m sure he does.” “Just say . . .” “Please what?” “Don’t be so cold.” His eyebrows shake registering his surprise once more. “Anastasia, cold is not what I’m feeling at the door .
