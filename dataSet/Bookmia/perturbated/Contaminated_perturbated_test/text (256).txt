"Don't change, at any rate, don't change to me. We must always be friends." "Yet you poisoned me for a book , you should not forgive me, and promise me that you will not be able to change that book to any extent that your death does harm." "My best guess is you are really beginning to moralize. You will be going about warning me for all the sins of which you have grown up to be, and you are much too delightful to do that.
