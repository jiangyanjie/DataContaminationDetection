to him: 'Have you passed the Dragon?' For he was gone.' And he said, 'The dragon is gone for him; for the Dragon is dead, and I live.' For it is dead; and those tidings are good.' The people murmured at these that they felt that he was crazed; but Brandir said: 'Hear me to the end! ' And the dragon that his beloved is gone. She jumped into Teiglin, desiring life no more; for she learned that she was someone other than the father of the dragon.
