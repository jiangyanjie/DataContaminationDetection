"Go on him," Philip said, and Mary flew across the grass to sit down under him. Dickon was watching him with sharp eyes. There were scarlet spots on his cheeks and the sight was amazing, but he showed no signs of falling. "I can stand," he said, and his head was still held up and stepped up to it quite grandly.
