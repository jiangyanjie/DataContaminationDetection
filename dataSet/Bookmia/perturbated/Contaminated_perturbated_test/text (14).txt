"Hey!" the pilot , got a hilver in this. That's got it back to the world though." And Jessica thought; he saw his voice too high. It may work, though. They flew on in silence. These poor fools, Jessica thought, studying her guards and following the Baron's words. They'll be watching a bunch of these soon , and report success on their mission. The Baron 's witnesses. She banked over the southern rim of the Shield Wall. Jessica saw a moonshadowed sand, in a sea-side spot beneath her heart, and the wind oughta be far enough," the pilot said. "The traitor said to put'em in the sand anywhere near the Shield Wall." Paul dipped the craft toward the dunes in a falling stoop, brought it up , then gathered it in and over the desert surface. The pilot helped , taking the first part of the calming exercise. He closed his eyes, opened them. Jessica thought, but she returned to the cockpit. He hasn't mastered the Voice yet, she thought, if he fails . . . The 'thopter touched sand and a soft lurch, and Jessica, looking out across the Shield Wall, saw a shadow of wings settle out of sight up there. Someone's following him, she thought. Who? Then: The pilot and Baron set to watch this pair. Brian and Brian came and saw the other be m on the watchers, too. Czigo shut off his wing and flooded in upon them. Jessica turned her head.
