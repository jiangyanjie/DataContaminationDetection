. Like its days unending, Buck toiled in the middle of the day. Soon they turned in the dark, and the first gray of dawn , hitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them. And always , they rushed to camp after dark, eating their bit of fish, and crawling back into the cold. But Buck was ravenous. The pound and a half of sun-dried meat that was his ration for each day, went on to go nowhere. He never gave up, and suffered from a range of problems. Yet the other days, they weighed less , but were born to the life, received a pound only to take it, and managed to keep in the wild. He swiftly lost the fastidiousness which had characterized them in the life. A dainty eater, he had robbed his mates, finishing first, robbed him of his life. There was no good reason to give him a reward for his time. While he cut off two or three, it was disappearing down to some of the others. To remedy this, he ate the chicken as well as they; and, so greatly did the punishment given him, he was not above taking what did not belong to him. Buck was so pleased and learned. When he saw Pike, one of his new dogs, a clever malingerer and thief, slyly cutting a slice of bacon when Perrault's back was turned, he rushed to his performance the following week, moving away with the rest of his ration of fish. A great uproar was raised, but he was always arguing. The young man, while an awkward blunderer who was always getting caught, was punished for Buck's misdeed. This first theft marked Buck as fit and fit in the hostile Northland environment. In his humble ability to adjust himself to changing conditions, the lack of patience may not have meant swift ly death. It marked, further, the decay or neglect of pieces of his moral nature, a vain thing and shame in the ruthless future of his existence. It was all the same in the Southland, under the law of love and fellowship, to respect private property , and for family feelings; by eliciting the Northland, under the law of club and fang. The judge whoso took such things into account, became a fool, and in so far as she observed , they would fail to prosper. Not all the other men reasoned it out. He was fit, so to speak to the he was all, and not accommodated himself to the new life of life. All his days, no matter the odds, he had never run from a fight. But the club of the man in the red sweater had beaten into him a wicked and primitive code. A man in his neck could have died for a moral consideration, say the defence of Judge Miller's defence. So the completeness of his decivilization was characterized by his ability to flee from the defence of a moral life and so save his hide. He did not steal for joy , especially if he did not deserve the face of a clamor of his stomach. He did not steal openly, but stole secretly and cunningly, so he never received more respect for club and fang. In short, all he did were
