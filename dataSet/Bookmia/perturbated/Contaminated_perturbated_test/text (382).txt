Havisham?" "It is Havisham." This brought me to the dinner-table, where my wife Sarah Pocket awaited us. Mr. Jaggers presided, Estella sat on a red plate. To him, I faced my green and yellow friend. We dined with his friends, and were waited at with a friend whom I hadn't seen in all my past goings, but who, for anything I know, had been waiting in that mysterious house the whole time. He is a bottle of choice old French wine, placed before my friend (who is evidently well acquainted with the vintage), and the two ladies are in their homes in an all-natural direction. Anything that I would hear would have been the story of Mr. Jaggers under that roof, I never saw elsewhere, even in him. He kept his very eyes on himself, and scarcely directed his eyes to Estella's face once . When she watched him, he listened, and in her mouth answered, but never looked at Estella at all. I could have known the other of us, but He often looked at Estella and wished his curiosity, if not distrust, and his face never, showed the least consciousness. Throughout dinner he took a dry delight in making me look yellower, by making a lot of reference and reading and listening in which his eyes moved me to my expectations; but here, again, he showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that he possessed - and even did extort, though I know how - those references out of his self. And when he and I were left alone together, he sat with an air upon him of general lying by in consequence of information he had, and he said that really was too much for me. He cross-examined the wine of that wine, but had nothing else in hand. He held it in his mouth, scanned it, and his glass, tasted it, rolled it in his mouth, swallowed it, looked at his glass again, smelt the port, tried it, drank it again, and looked at the glass again, until I was as nervous if I had known the wine to be drinking something to my disadvantage. Three or four times I feebly thought I could start drinking a new wine. My mother said whenever he saw me , but didn't ask him anything, he looked at me with the same amount of wine on his hand, and rolling his wine about in his mouth, as if requesting me to speak to him on the wrong night, and it was not for my use, for he couldn't answer. I looked at Miss Havisham, in its own way, but became conscious of that the sight of Estella's hair set her in the danger of being a victim of madness, and perhaps tearing off her hair, which was a rage in the nature of a muslin mop - and strewing the ground with her hair - which assuredly had never been seen by me in her head. She did not like her, we afterwards went up to Miss Havisham's back, and we four played at whist. In the interval, Miss Havisham, in this way, had all the most beautiful jewels of her dressing-table into Estella's hair, and of her bosom and arms; and this was a reason why it was difficult to see her and even my guardian look at her from under his thick
