different ways of getting hot and tired were gone through with, but was the roaring battle, and --------------------------------------------------------- -262- by the rovers . The camp fortified with responsible appetites, and the destruction of the good things began. After the feast there was the season of rest and the fried coffee in the shade of the fire. By-and-by somebody shouted: "Who's in the hall?" That was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there was a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the wood stood dragged up until the water fell -- the only way to enter was like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood unbarred. Within was a limestone quarry which was used as an ice-house, where it was surrounded by a stone that has an abysmal stone with solid limestone that surrounds with a cold soil, it was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The first candle came off, and a lot of a general rush upon the owner of it; a struggle and a gallant defence followed, a candle was soon knocked down or blown out, and there was a glad clamor of laughter and a new beginning that was to take place once all things have an end.

No end to the cave. That was an impossible thing. Most of the young men knew much of it, and it was not that difficult to venture much beyond this known portion. Tom Sawyer knew as much of the cave as any one. He climbed along the main route, three-quarters of a mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch avenues, climb along the corridors, and take each other by surprise , and make a point of sight where the corridors joined again. They were able to elude each other for the space of an hour without going beyond the "known" ground. By-and-by, one group after another came straggling through the mouth of the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared , and rolled foot to foot with tallow drippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted by the success of the day. Then they began to find that the group was in the same direction, taking no
