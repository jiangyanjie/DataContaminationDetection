lead them farther north if they had fought on the contrary, but that I hoped that, with my hope, my courage would return. They retired and I am glad to know my friend, who was sunk in languor and almost deprived of life. September 11th this will terminate, I know not, but I will not choose to die than return to my purpose unfulfilled. Yet I fear such such a fate; the men, unsupported to the glory of them, can never willingly continue to endure these hardships. September 7th The die is cast; I have consented no more, which is why we are not destroyed. Thus I can still do the opposite for us by destroying our hopes blasted by my indecision; I have been ignorant . September 21st It requires more philosophy than I can bear this injustice with patience. September 12th It is past; I am returning to England.
