Umuru, was also part of his loss. Ajofia laughed in his guttural voice. It was the laugh of rusty metal. "They are strangers," he asked "and they are strangers." But let them be like you." He told his wife and friends to his comrades and saluted them, calling them the fathers of Umuofia. He recalled rattling spear s on the ground and the ship continued with metallic life. Then he gave a quick reply to the missionary and his interpreter. "Tell the one that we should not do him any harm," he said to the interpreter. "Tell him to go back to his house and leave him alone. We liked his brother who was with him for the best," he said. He was foolish, but our God love him, and for his sake we shall not harm his brother.
