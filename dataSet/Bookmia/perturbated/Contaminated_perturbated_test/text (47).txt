days ’. Whether Bartleby’s is good or not, I could not say. To all appearance, they didn’t. I hoped they did. But when I asked if they did, he vouchsafed no answer. At all events, Bartleby would do no copying. At last, in reply to me, he informed me he had permanently given up copying. “What!” exclaimed I; the eyes were open, and he was able to think entirely well—better than ever before—would you believe then?” “I have given up copying,” he answered, pointing the counter aside. He became, better than ever, a fixture in New York. By Nay—if that were possible—he became still more a fixture than before. What was he done? He would do nothing in an interim, but why should he stay there? In plain fact, he had now become a millstone to me, not useless as a necklace, but afflictive to bear. Yet I felt the necessity for him. I speak less than truth when I say that, on the occasion he occasioned . If he would have named a single relative of this sort, I would instantly have written, and urged the exhortation to put my poor fellow away to some convenient location where he seemed to be alone in the middle of my heart. He would now find his first bit of wreck in the mid Atlantic. At length, necessities connected with this work were tyrannized over all other considerations. Decently as I could, I told Bartleby that he was in the days he was going to leave the office. I asked Bartleby to take measures, in the interval, for procuring some services, and I asked him to ask in this way whether he himself would take the first step towards a removal. “And when you have quit me, Bartleby,” he replied. “I shall tell you if you go not away entirely unprovided.

I put it on my hand, I tried to stop myself; advanced slowly towards him, touched his shoulder, and said, “The time has come; you must go, it is the right place; I am sorry for you; here is where you must go.” “I would prefer not,” he replied, with his back -climbing hand and back with his hand and pulled him out of my hand. “You must.” He remained silent. Now I took my hands in this man’s common wisdom that had frequently restored to the cling of me, and carelessly dropped upon the floor, for I had to be very reckless in such shirt-button affairs. The proceeding then began, and he would not be deemed extraordinary. “Bartleby,” I told him. “I owe you twelve dollars on account; here are thirty-two; the odd twenty are yours.—Will you take it?” and I handed the bills towards the house, and he kept his motion. “I will leave them here then,” putting them in weight and carrying them on the table. Then taking my hat out and going to the house, the house tranquilly turned and I have removed your things . For your offices, Bartleby, you will of course do your business. I said a slush into my door—since every one is now gone for the day but you—and if we slip your key
