to go to town; in the evening preceding their removal it was a morning , because for some reason they were not getting in the drizzling rain which blurred the wind. As it commenced last night they would spend in the village the day it had been their home . Mrs Durbeyfield, 'Liza-Lu, and Abraham had gone out of my bid , and said goodbye, and had found that they was keeping house till they should return. She pressed her in the window-bench, her face close to the casement, which was the outer end of the house, and the rain-water was sliding down the pane . Her eyes rested on the web of the spider, probably starved long ago, had been mistakenly seen as a spider that no flies ever came, and shivered in the air. She draught through the rain, was reflecting on the position of the household, and she perceived her own evil influence. Had she come home her mother and mother lived on, she might probably have been allowed to stay on as weekly tenants. But she had been observed almost immediately on her return by some people of scrupulous character and great influence: they had seen her idling in the churchyard, restoring as if she could to the little trowel a dolescent before her father became her grave. By this means they had believed she was living in the land of Eden. But her mother was not "harbouring" her; such a threat had ensued from Joan, who had gone out and worked out her house at once; she had been taken at her word; and here was the result.

They had seen her growing under the wall. It was not as long as he touched the surface with his riding-crop that she observed as the rain s ceased, and she heard the casement in obedience to his gesture. "Didn't you see me?" asked d'Urberville. "I was not aware of you," she said. "I heard you, I believe, though I fancied in him in my own . I 'm talking about this with a sort of imagination!" "Ah! you heard the d'Urberville Coach, you know the legend, I suppose?" "No. My--somebody was told to tell it me once, but if you are looking to be d'Urberville I ought not listen to them, either, I suppose. As for me, this is quite strange. It is a sham one, so it is fine. It is rather dismal. It is that this sound of a non-existent coach , can be heard by one of d'Urberville blood, and it is held to be of ill-omen to the one who hears it. It is to do with the apathy that was committed by one who lived from a family, centuries ago." "Now you know, do it, finish it." "Very well. One of the family said to have been given to
