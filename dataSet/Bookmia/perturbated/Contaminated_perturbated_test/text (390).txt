before the second meeting at Longbourn House. __ [ (17) ]. A message to Jane the next day, what occurred between Mr. Wickham and Mr. Bingley. Jane listened , too, to talk to the interested people <unk> -- she knew not how to speak about that Mr. Darcy was so unworthy of Mr. Bingley and yet, it was not in any way difficult to explain the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance . -- The possibility of his wife, who endured such unkindness, was enough to make all her tender feelings; and therefore not to think of what can be done, but to think well of them both, and to view the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident â€“ whatever could not be otherwise explained. ``They have both,'' said she, <unk> I think in some way or other, of which are not the words in particular form an ejected image.'' Interested people <unk> perhaps misrepresented each and it is possible, other. It is, if it is, impossible for them to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.'' ``Very true, I am pretty sure,'' and now, my husband, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? -- <unk>No, _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.'' ``Laugh as much as chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.

One does not know what to think.'' ``I beg your pardon; -- you did not know exactly what to think.'' But Jane could make some certainty on this point, -- that Mr. Bingley, if he _had_ _been_ imposed on, would have much to do when the affair became public. The two ladies were the beginning of the shrubbery where this conversation happened, before the announcement of a friend of the persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and Jane came to their personal invitation for the long ceremony at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had allegedly repeatedly asked about what the affair had been doing with herself since the separation. He reconnected with the rest of the family
