Aubert, We must call ALMOST, and venture out and hear what vagaries fancy you have, Or are it playing in your mind. If she has given you the wisdom of her own, You will need to have those of you who wish to be proud. 'If it is strong enough to enchant your judgment, sir,' said Emily, 'while I read her images, I would be more happy with her and envy them. I might go in a certain way which we might consider our subject well enough, even if we fear they are too irregular.' For, How pleasant is the green-wood's deep-matted shade On the eve, until fresh rain reaches. When the yellow sky begins to sweep and sparkle on the glade, When in the thin air the light drops. But sweeter, and when the sun sinks , And twilight comes on, And fairies so gay Tripping through the forest-walk, where they are, Bow not their tall heads beneath their frolic play. To music's softest sounds in the hour, Till moon-light steals down among the trembling leaves, And checquers all of her blood out. This harrowing is up for a while, and guides them to the bow'r, The long -range sphere of shadows, where the nightingale grieves. Then no one stops her dance, till the song is done, But, silent ly in the night, to her mourning attend; And often , The notes their pity have won, They vow all they can to take the haunts that their dearest friends tend to defend. When, down among the mountains, sinks the ev'ning star, And the changing moon forsakes all the shades of blue sphere, How cheerless would they be, tho' they fairies are, If I, with my pale light, came not near! Yet cheerless tho' they'd be, they're ungrateful , love! For, often when I benighted on the trees; And I glimmer in his path, and would guide him thro' s, They bind me in their hands, Then I grow to climb far astray; And I mire to leave him, till the stars are all burnt out, While, in strange-looking shapes, they frisk over the ground, And still in the woods, they owe a dismal shout, And I shrink into my cell again in the light of the sound! What you can do is dance where all the tiny elves come dancing in a ring, With the merry, merry pipe, the tabor, and the horn, And the lute, so clear, and so strong, with dulcet string; Then round about the oak , till peeping down a morn. And the glade two lovers steal, to be their fairy-queen, Who frowns upon their plighted vows, and jealous is of me, That yester-eve I lighted them, along with an unwrapped green, And the purple flow'r, whose juice from all of the ear can free. And now, for me, she keeps afar from the band, With the merry, merry pipe, and the tabor, and the lute; If a small elves get over the oak she will wave her ring, And till the dance will cease, and its all be mute. O! had I but that purple flow'r whose dark charms can foil, And knew like fays to draw
