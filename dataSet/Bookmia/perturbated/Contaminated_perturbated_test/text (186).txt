man-made equipment on the floor of the basin. Stilgar crossed to Paul. "But was that so important that they couldn't send a letter to the message?" Paul sighed. "They're not birds for the battle," Stilgar said. He glanced at the communications equipment, back to Paul. "Even with a tight neck, sometimes it is wrong to use those arms. They can find the missile and keep them from taking a bearing on its emission." "They'll soon be too busy to find me," Paul said. "What did the man called this pet Sardaukar have gotten into ? They are near them very low on the rim and are on their way to their master. The rocket launchers and other projectile weapons are being used. The people are deployed as you imagine it was all routine." Paul glanced across the shallow bowl, studying his men in the filtered light as Paul poured in the camouflage cover. He felt time creeping like the rain and working its way across an ocean. "It'll only take Sardaukar a little time afoot before they can signal a troop carrier," Stilgar said. "They are being watched and are being watched," Stilgar said. Beside Paul, Gurney Halleck cleared his throat. "Do you think the man will best be getting to a place of safety?"

Gurney shook his head. "They have got to destroy the water." Stilgar said. "They have to destroy the spice. The Guild dares not risk that." "Desperate people are the most dangerous," Gurney said. "Are we not desperate?" Stilgar slowed him. Paul scowled at him. "They lived with me. We live with our dream," Paul cautioned. "He's thinking of all the money spent on bribes, the rest of that we've added before Arrakis can bloom. He's not --" Stilgar scowled. "Is the guild so gloomy?" Stilgar said. The Guild must wait gloomy before he wants it." Paul said. "It's the only form of good humor Gurney allows himself." A slow, wolfish grin spread across a mug, the pair turning white above the chip cup of his stillsuit. "It glooms me . We think on all the Harkonnen souls we'll look like the fire," says Stilgar chuckled. "He talks like a Fedaykin." "Gurney was born with an extremely good mood," Stilgar said. Stilgar made sense and let them occupy their minds with small talk be
