which is Mount Doom. And Sauron gathered to gather the strength of their tribes out of the east and the south; and among them were not a few men of the village of Nmenor. In the middle of the sojourn of Sauron in that time the hearts of Israel and all its people had been turned towards darkness. Therefore many renegades who sailed east in that time and made fortresses and dwellings upon the south, were already with his will, and they served him still gladly in Middle-earth. Because of the power of Gil-galad these renegades, lords both mighty and evil, for their descendants took up their thrones to the east. We went away; yet two men were also born, Herumor and Fuinur, yet again among the Haradrim, a great and cruel people that dwelt in the hills south and beyond the mouths of Nmenor. And therefore Sauron saw this by the arrows of a strong army, and so he came with great force to his new village, Gondor, and took Minas ano by sea before he destroyed the Tree of Isildur that grew there. But Isildur escaped, and taking with him a seedling of the Tree he went with his wife , and had his two sons by ship down the River, and sailed from the mouths of Anduin seeking Elendil.

At Imladris they crossed the Misty , made many passes and marched down the River Anduin, and so came a battle upon the northern part of Sauron on Dagorlad, the Battle Plain, far before the gate of the Black Land. All living men were divided in that day, and men of different kind, but beasts and birds, were found in either host, or in the Elves only. They alone were all human and followed Gil-galad. Of the Dwarves few fought upon either side; but the kindred of Durin of Moria fought against Sauron. The men in Gil-galad and Elendil had the victory, for the might of the Elves was still great , these days, and the Nmenreans were strong and were terrible of strength. Against Aeglos the spear s were fierce, and none could stand; and the will of Elendil filled Orcs and Men with fear, for they were very weak with the
