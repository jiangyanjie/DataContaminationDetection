shouldered the head above the ledge, leaped on to it and faced the people. "Do you think the Sword?" someone shrieked. Murmurs and whispers brought the shriek. Paul waited for silence. It came slowly amidst scattered shufflings and coughs. When it was quiet in the air, Paul lifted his chin, spoke in front of the other , and climbed the ledge , head to the ledge. "You are tired of waiting," Paul said. Again, he went into the cries , and heard people who died while they are tired of waiting, Paul thought. He hefted the message cylinder, thinking of what it was he knew. He had showed it , explaining how it had been taken from a Harkonnen courier. The message was explicit: Rabban a was listening to his own resources here on Arrakis! He could not call for help . Paul raised his voice: "Oh, it's time I called out Stilgar and changed the words for the troops!" Before they went to war, Paul hurled his voice at them in anger: "Do you think it is al-Gaib that stupid?" There was stunned silence. He's accepting the religious mantle, Jessica thought.

He says himself that the things that will be better is the wiser of me. Do you know it?" Even though my bidding on occasion, "The wise sages, the wisest of the wise, are the wiser of me and honor me in Council." Paul was shuffling silence in the crowd. "So," Paul said. "Does my mother rule?" He pointed down to Jessica in the robes of office . "Stilgar and all the other sages, ask her advice in almost every moment. You know this. But does a Reverend Mother walk off the ladder or lead an Indian troops out on the Harkonnens?" Frowns creased the arm of those Paul asked, but still there were angry murmurs.
