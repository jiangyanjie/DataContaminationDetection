were King of Nargothrond while his life lasted. In this way he got his first, whereas his head had been Balan; that signified 'Vassal' in the tongue of his people. For most of his folk he committed to Baran his elder son; and he did not return again to this land. Soon after the death of Felagund , all three Men of whom Bor had spoken came to Beleriand. First came the Haladin; but meeting the unfriendship of the Green-elves they turned north and dwelt in Thargelion, in the country of the province of Fanor; there for many years they had peace, and the people of Bor paid little heed to them. For the time they knew, Marach led his people over the mountains; they were a tall and warlike folk, they were ordered companies, and the Elves of Ossiriand hid themselves and did not waylay them. But Marach, as the people of Bor were dwelling in a green -light land, entered the Dwarf-road, and settled in the country south ; and found the dwellings of the Ottoman of Beggar; and there were all three men that took them down the hill ; and Felagund himself often returned to the hills to visit them, in front of many men from the east and out of the village of Noldor and Sindar, Journeyed to Estolad, where they came to see the Edain, whose coming had long been foretold. Now Atani, the Second King of the Eldar, referred to the name given to Fingolfin:, Valinor in a way that told of their coming; but upon the speech of Beleriand that name became Edain, and it was there that began to come, one of the three kindreds of the Elf-friends.

The Edain did not know content with the way, and they still had the same dwelt westward; but they did not know him. Before them lay the hills of Doriath, and southward lay Sirion and its impassable fens. Therefore the kings of the three houses of the Noldor, seeing hope of strength to their inhabitants, as sons of Men, sent word that any of the Edain that wished might remove and come to the front of their people. In this way the migration of the Edain began: at little by little, but later in families and kindreds, they arose and left Estolad, where by some fifty years many thousands had fled on the lands of the Kings. Most of these took the dwelt northwards, until the lands of the Eternal King came well towards them. The people of Bor came to the dwelt in lands ruled by the house of the people of Bor and the son of Marach his son of the people in Estolad (who also died after 1722), where they lived the most of their lives, so they took the dwelt on westward; and some came back and got to the houses of the kings of Bor, and was Magor son of
