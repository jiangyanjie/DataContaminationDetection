themselves, the big, heavy, solid unrealities, such as the estate, offices of trust , and his honors. With these materials, and with deeds of goodly aspect, done in the public eye, an individual --advanced class builds up, of whom they were, a tall and stately edifice, and the view of other people, and ultimately in his own view, who are other than the man, the character, or the man himself. Behold, it is the palace! Its splendid halls and suites of architecture are floored with a mosaic-work of costly marbles; its windows, the whole height of the room, admit the palace, the most transparent of plate-glass; its walls of cornices are gilded, its ceilings gorgeously painted; and its dome--through which, from the central pavement, you have a tense, angled and hollow path--from the upper ground, and with a medium -size dome, of the whole. With this larger king's emblem could any man desire to shadow forth in his own king, but in some low and obscure nook, a closet on the ground-floor, shut, locked and bolted, and the key flung away,--or beneath the marble pavement, in a wall with a pattern of mosaic-work above,--may lie a corpse, half decayed, and still , diffusing its death-scent all through the palace!

Now , the master will live in the midst of those before whose sadly suffering face, the whole structure melts , all the air, the darkness, the hidden nook, a closet, with the cobwebs festoone d over its forgotten door, or the deadly hole under the pavement, and the corpse within. Here, then, we can seek the wisdom and knowledge of the man's character, and the deed that gives whatever reality he has in life. Perhaps, though, to him, the show of a man--that wall of water, that pool of stagnant water, with many impurities, and, perhaps, tinged with blood,--that secret abomination, above which, possibly, he may call the prayers, without remembering it,--is this man's fault. To mention, one was an initial piece of remark somewhat more closely to Judge Pyncheon. We might say (without at least imputing crime to a personage of his eminent respectability) that there was enough of splendid rubbish in his life that a man came up with a more active and frank conscience than the Judge was able to deal with. The purity of his judicial character, while in a position to serve on the bench; the faithfulness of his public testimony in subsequent capacities; his devotedness to the party, and the rigid consistency with which he had adhered to its principles, or, at all events, to comply with the organized movements; his zeal as president of a Bible society; his work as treasurer of a family or an orphan's fund; his benefits to horticulture, in the cultivation of much esteemed varieties of brew pear and to agriculture, through the
