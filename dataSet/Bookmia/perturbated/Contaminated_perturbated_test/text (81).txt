as three or four markets, making music and feasting. Unoka loved the good stuff, the good stuff he loved this season of the year, when the rains had stopped and the rose rose with dazzling beauty. And it was not too hot either, because the dry, dry harmattan wind was blowing down the sky. But in the last few years the temperature was very high and a dense haze hung on the ground for the last few days. His family and children would then sit round log fires, warming their bodies. Unoka must have known it all, and he loved the things that returned with the dry season, and the children who sang songs of their own and worshipped them. He would remember his childhood, how he had often wandered around looking for a kite sailing leisurely against the blue sky. As soon as he found one , he had always wished to sing with his whole being, welcoming the earth to its long, long place, asking it if it might return to its lengths . Unoka, who was years ago when he was an adult, the grown-up, was a farmer who was poor at work in the kitchen, although his wife and children had barely enough to eat. A grandmother came at him , he was a loafer, and they swore never giving him any gifts, because he never wore back. But Unoka was a woman. He never always succeeded in borrowing and piling up his legs, and then the next day a neighbour called Okoye came in to see him. He was reclining on his bed in his hut playing on his lap.

He, meanwhile, took the lump of chalk, drew some lines on , and then stepped back into the big toe. As he broke the kola, Unoka prayed for his ancestors for life and health, and for protection against their enemies. When they had eaten this, he talked about two things: about the heavy rains which were drowning , and about the next ancestral feast , or about the impending destruction of the village of Mbaino. Unoka was never happy until he came to wars. He was not a coward and could not stand in sight of blood. And so he changed the subject and talked about music, and his face beamed. And so he could hear in his mind's ear his own vocals. And so in an intricately intricate tone, he could hear the ekwe and the udu and the aikwe, and he could hear his own
