Well, I turned at the counter and swung the one out of a pile and smashed it on his silly head as he came home. The n I saw all the pots , and I heard shouting , in all parts. I made a rush for the next one, and there was a man in white like a man cook, who took up the top of my house. I took his last desperate turn , and I rushed to save myself among lamps and ironmongery. I went behind the counter of this, and waited for my cook, and as he bolted in at the head of the chase, I doubled him up with a lamp.
