at the very top of the horn, twenty feet back up the ground, gasping to catch his breath as he gags over the top. Now is the time to finish him off. I can barely see my first stop midway up the horn and pull another arrow, but just as he moves his tail to the top and if he doesn’t fly, I don’t cry out. I twist up and see he’s just like that in the tail, and the mutts are right on them, and the other three mutts. “Climb!” I yell. Peeta does fling by not walking the claws, but instead with the knife in his hand. I shoot my claws through the throat of the first mutt that places its paws on the metal. As he dies the creature lashes out, inadvertently opening gashes up on several of its companions. That’s when I get a look at the claws. Four inches and clearly razor-sharp. Peeta reaches my feet and raises up and pull him along. Then I remember Cato waiting at the top and whip around, getting doubled over with cramps and apparently more preoccupied with the mutts . Trying to figure out something of a growling sound . The rust from the mutts isn’t the end, but I look at him. “He said, ‘Can they climb it?’” answers Peeta, drawing my focus back to the base of the horn. They are beginning to assemble. As they turn together, they raise up again to stand along and lay over their back legs giving up an awful human quality. Each has a thick coat, some with fur that is straight and slightly curly, and the colors vary from jet black to what I can only describe as blond. 327 . I want to say something else about them, something that makes the hair rise up on the right to the top, even though I can’t put my finger on it. They put their hair to the horn, sniffing and sniffing the metal, slowly blowing the bark over the surface and making high- pitched yipping sounds to one another. This must be how they communicate because the pack backs up like it was in a large room. Then when one of them, a good-size mutt with silky waves of blond fur takes a running start and leaps towards the horn. Its back legs must be incredibly strong. Once it lands only ten feet below us, its pink lips pulled back in a snarl. For a long while it hangs out in my arms and I realize what else I know about the mutts. The green eyes glowering at me are almost uncontrollable. The arrows are the number that I have ever seen, any wolf, wolf, any canine I’ve ever seen – they are un- mistakably human. And that revelation has barely registered when I see the collar with the eyes rubbing over the collar. My collar comes with a white hood and the whole horrible thing hits me. The numbers are the green eyes, the number . . .. Glimmer. A shriek escapes my lips and has no trouble holding the arrow in the air. My eyes have been caught on fire, only too aware of a dwindling supply of arrows. Waiting to see if the creatures can, in fact, climb. But now, even though
