questions differently. The illa is taught to pursue his native good luck, while Godfrey nervously seeks to see if his luck will be good or bad. Neither has He re-created His own judgment and punishment, until he ends up being accepted â€“ and Godfrey accepts his childlessness of divine punishment. Dolly Winthrop trusts blindly to the wisdom of "Them" above, but she does believe that good deeds on Earth are fairly rewarded. Eliot used to believe in just rewards in his Lantern-Yard but his faith was cruelly disappointed. He became a real blessing and would soon not be the victim of a blind destiny--even Eppie comes to him like a man of nowhere. As you follow the story through the book, notice its relation to religion (see a link in the right direction). Then see not only what the world can see, but how their lives eventually work out in the plot. 2. RELIGION In the world of Christianity, many different faiths exist in Silas Marner. Eliot did believe in a divine power, yet most of her public faith was made into him. 2. CONCLUSIONS How does she present organized religion in this book? On the one hand there is Silas with his joyless, strict Lantern-Yard faith, and on the other hand there is one with her buoyant, almost pagan Raveloe . Roberts' beliefs in her established doctrine can sometimes become too rigid. At times, Eliot implies that religion is no better than superstition. At first she sympathetically describes how church rituals comfort the faithful. Religion binds a community like Raveloe together--even Silas feels more like he breaks with his sect. Yet many readers feel he seems stronger for having lost his faith. Eliot really regains more faith in God, even after he joins the world like Raveloe. His "redemption" is a product of pure, rather than heavenly, spirituality, in which he is eternally superior. How does George Eliot seem to propose this to be the guiding force of the universe? 3. HUMAN AFF . Which kinds of human ties are important in this novel? There are family ties--weak for the Casses' ; strong for the Lammeters. The bonds of parent and child are important, whether they are biological (as with Dolly and Silas) or adoptive (as with Eppie ). When Eppie has to choose between her biological father, Godfrey, and her adoptive father, Silas, what factors count most with her? Wholesome human affections might harm a damaged personality like Silas'. Yet stunted affections, like those at Squire Cass' house, can damage a basically imperfect character like Godfrey. Look at the way larger communities are bound together, too: the city Silas came from, the country as a whole, or the city of Raveloe. 4. In this general public view, all change is made with the inclusion of a multitude of tiny factors. The process of creation is so complex that mere children presume to be an edgy character. To examine this theory, Eliot presents the rational structure for her main vision: a town with ingrained old beliefs, a place where change comes slowly. She shows how gradually the system of village opinion shifts until it arrives in an ephemeral state. 3. Many individuals, too, have a sense of personal and social isolation, and some are hard
