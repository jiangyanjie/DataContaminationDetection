the same--" "We don't see him ever," said Jack, flatly. "Three's enough." Piggy's glasses flashed. "I was with him , I hit a conch. I was with him before anyone else was." Jack and Simon paid no attention. There was a general dispersal. Ralph, Jack and Simon jumped off the platform and walked the same way. Jack and Simon closed the bathing pool. Piggy hung out with them. "If Simon walks in the middle of me," said Ralph, "then we could talk out of my head." The three of them fell . This meant nothing now . Jack and Simon had to make a double shuffle and set up with the others. Presently Ralph stopped and turned , and pressed to Piggy. "Look." Jack and Simon pretended to have said that Piggy walked on. "We could come." Piggy's glasses were misted again--this time with humiliation. "You told 'em. After what I said." His eyebrows and his mouth trembled. "After I said I didn't want--" So what on earth are you talking about?" "About me... Piggy. "After this, I didn't care as we said they didn't call me Piggy; an' I said not to tell and that went an' said straight out--" Stillness descended on them. Ralph, looking with more understanding , saw that he was hurt and crushed. He hovered between the stars with no apology or further insult. "You are better than Fatty," he said at last, with a heart of genuine optimism and more patience. "Okay... I'm sorry. "Well I know, you feel bad. Now go back and make sure you have some of your job. So Ralph turned and raced after the other two. Piggy stood on the platform, after his rose of indignation faded slowly from him. He turned . The three boys turned to the platform. The boys walked briskly on the sand. The tide and roaring, and was sitting on a strip of weed-strewn beach , almost as firm as the road. A kind of glamour was spread over all the different parts of the scene and a lot of people were conscious of the glamour and looked by it. They turned over each other, constantly talking, not having any problems. The air was bright. Ralph, faced by the task of translating all this into an explanation, stood on his head and fell over. Even if we had done laughing, Ralph pinned his head shyly; and turned on his head, and left him alone to laugh again. "Come on," said Jack, "we're explorers." "Look around the end of the island," said Ralph, "and look round the corner." "This is an island--" Now, toward the end of the afternoon, the mirages were settling a little. They found the end of the island, quite strange, and not magicked out of their sense. There was a jumble of the usual squareness, a great block sitting on the ground. Sea birds were nesting there. "Like icing," said Ralph, "on a pink cake." "We shan't look at it," said Jack, "because there 's quite a chance of a rock on our table. Only a few blocks off you can see, the rocks are great." Ralph shaded his head and followed the jagged outline of the crags up toward the mountain.
