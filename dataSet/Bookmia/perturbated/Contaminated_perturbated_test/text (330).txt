him into the wall with the axe and smashed in the door. I beat it up and fetched it considerable ly. I fetched the pig in, and took it nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and then it would roll down on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was not hard packed, and no boards. Well, next I went with the old saw and put a lot of bits of metal in the cupboard -- all I could drag -- and I started to take it into the kitchen. I dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river, and I dumped it in, and it sunk, out of sight. You could see that something would have dragged over with this little treasure. So, I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; if he would take an extended buck from this day on business, and give it all the fancy touches. Nobody could spread it, and he put Tom Sawyer in the same thing as that. Well, I pulled out some of my hair, and took the axe good, and let him go down on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner. Then I took up the pig off, and got back on with my bag, and turned him into the water with my jacket (so he couldn't drip) till I were good . I took it to the house and then dumped him into the river. I'd thought of some- thing else. So I went and got the bag down and trimmed them in a saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house. I then tied the bag to where it used to stand, and laid down the saw to the smallest hole from a hole in the bottom of the house with the saw, for there warn't no knives and forks on the place -- pap done with his clasp-knife about . Then I carried the saw a hundred yards across the river and through the front of the house, and froze the pig into a shallow lake that was five mile deep, full of rushes -- and ducks too, you might think. It was the river; there was a s up a pond, a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away, I don't know where, but it didn't go to the lake. The n I left the creek out and made a little track all the way to the lake. I dropped and pushed the canoe there too, so as to look at how that had been done by accident. Then I tied up the rip in the middle of the sack with a string, so it wouldn't be more, and took it a saw to the canoe again. It's dark now; I dropped the canoe from the river , and watched the willows that hung over the bank, and waited the moon to get all made fast to a willow; then I had a bite to eat, and I followed by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe , and figure out a plan. I 'm certain that for myself, they'll follow the track of the river's ful l and stick to the
