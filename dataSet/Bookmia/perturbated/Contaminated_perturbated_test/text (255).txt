come in with what is most important to you as ever.'' She did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to other people which the humour and humour of Bingley, not less than an hour's visit, had revived. On Tuesday there was a party assembled at Longbourn; and the people who were most well-regarded, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, and as they were in their former parties, had a little sympathy with him, by her sister. Elizabeth, for her mother, had the same joy to attempt to bring a smile to herself. On entering the room, Jane seemed to hesitate; he seemed to look round, and happened to be glad that his wish was decided. He placed himself by her. As soon as he got to a room, Jane looked towards his friend. He took with noble and boldness, which would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm. His behaviour to her sister was such, during the night, as an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured.

Her mother's ungraciousness, made the time to be what they owed him more to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, in any sense, not have been given any thing to be privileged to tell him that she was being treated and the family was neither unknown nor unfelt by her friends from the family. She was in hopes that he would afford some opportunity to interact with them with him and that the end of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to find something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the room as the gentlemen came, was slow and dull to hear. I think that was her uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the year on which all her chance of pleasure for the gentlemen would depend. ``If he does not come to me, _then_,'' said the <unk>I shall hold up for ever.'' The gentlemen came; and she thought in his way as if he would have answered her hopes; but,
