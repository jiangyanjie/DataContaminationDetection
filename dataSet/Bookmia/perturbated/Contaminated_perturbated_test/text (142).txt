said Amy, much impressed by the note. "This is absolutely honey. Let's hear the sound of the baby pianny," said Hannah, who always seemed to share in the family joys and sorrows. So Beth tried to answer, but everyone pronounced it the most remarkable piano ever heard. It had been put up and put in applepie s, but as perfect as it was, I think the real joy would have been that if it had been in the happiest of the faces which leaned over it, as Beth lovingly grabbed the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright pedals. "You'll ever go wrong to him," cried Hannah, by way of a little encouragement to Sarah. "I chuckle for the idea of what the pianny had really been, and she entered her voice.
