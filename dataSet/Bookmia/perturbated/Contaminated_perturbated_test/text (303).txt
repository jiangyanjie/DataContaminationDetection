bawling at him, "I don't have this room in there...I need that room...make him get out..." Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he'd have given anything to be up here. I thought he'd rather be back in his cupboard with his letter than up here without it. *** Next to the breakfast, Harry was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. But Harry had whacked his hand with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown him on the greenhouse roof, but still didn't have his room . Dudley was angry this time , bitterly wishing he'd opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Dudley were looking at Harry darkly. When the letter opened and the letter opened, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and be patient. Harry followed him to a window with his Smelting stick all the way to the hall. Then he shouted, "There's another one! 'Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive -- '" With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and sat in the back of the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to the ground, or so to get the letter from him, which was made by the fact that Harry had grabbed it, pulled Harry around the ground and left Harry alone. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a little like the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon turned gasping for breath, with Harry's letter clutched in hand. "Your bedroom is your cupboard -- I mean, your bedroom," Harry laughed at Harry. "Oh, no. Oh, no -- just go." Harry walked round and round his room. Harry knew he had moved to a room next to Harry, and seemed to know he had returned to his first letter. So was that Harry to try again? And this time he'd make sure they didn't fail. He had a plan. *** The entire clock rang at two o'clock the next morning. Harry turned around quickly and dressed silently. He mustn't wake the Dursleys. He stole the doormat, the name on any of the letters. His mother was going to wait for the postman on the corner of the Privet Drive and get the letters for number 3! His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the door -- Harry leapt into the air; he'd trodden sighing out and squashy on the doormat t. It's alive! Lights flashed as Harry turned upstairs and to his horror Harry sat down behind the front floor which had no problem amidst their uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had been lying in the corner of the front door and pulled into a sleeping room making sure that he could do exactly what he'd been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for almost an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the office, and by the time he got into the kitchen, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's door to his ear. Thanks for the lovely warm atmosphere. I really admire Harry
