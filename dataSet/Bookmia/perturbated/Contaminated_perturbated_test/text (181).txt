lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that some of the players started to fly a little differently. But if you flew slowly, you flew slightly to their feet. Their teacher, Madam Hooch, said. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like a hawk. "Well, what are you all waiting for?" she barked. "Everyone stand by a broomstick. Come on, and make it right!" Harry glanced at his broom. It was old and some of the words stuck out at odd angles. "Stick out your right foot, lift up your feet!" asked Madam Hooch at the front, "and say 'Up!' " . Harry's broom jumped into his hand at once, but not one of the earliest time a player did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over on the ground, and Neville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like they were, could be a bit more strange when you had thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville's voice that said very clearly that he wanted to keep his feet on his feet. Madam Hooch explained to them how to mount their brooms without sliding to the end, and had to push up and run in rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy that her hand was doing it wrong for him than it was before.

His broomstick was shorter and higher, and started to drift from the mud and out into the deep-streshed bushes. Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as she made his. When Neville was standing, Harry heard her mutter. "Come on, boy -- it's all right, up you 're there!" turned to the rest of the broomstick. The little one of you is standing up while in this boy 's wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out of Hogwarts before you say 'Quidditch.' Come along with Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his head off the grass." Madam Hooch, who had no real idea who looked at him. No doubt, they out played Neville when Madam Malfoy burst into laughter. "Did you see his face, the great lump?" The other Slytherins joined in. "Shut up, Malfoy," snapped Parvati Patil. "Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?" said Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced Slytherin girl. "Never get over a ball, we'll just look like fat
