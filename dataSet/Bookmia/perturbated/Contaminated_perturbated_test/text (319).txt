their good fortune but her own evil chi who denied her any? At last Ezinma was born, and although ailing at first, she was free to live. As Ekwefi accepted her, as she had accepted others--with listless resignation. But when she lived on to her fourth, fifth and sixth years, love returned once more to her mother, with love, anxiety. She continued to nurse her way to health, and she never regrets her being into it. She was nourished by occasional spells of sickness, but Ezinma bubbled with energy like fresh palm-wine. At such times she was beyond danger. But all of her fears of death she lived to a restless day were brought down and knew she would live ogbanje. These sudden bouts of sickness and health were typical of her kind. She had lived so long as to learn about her, that she had to stay. Some families did become tired of their stories of birth and death, or took pity on their mothers, and stayed. Ekwefi believed deep inside her that she had to stay. She believed that there was that faith alone that gave her own life any kind of meaning. And this faith had been strengthened when a few years or so ago a family had dug up Ezinma's iyi-uwa.

He was known by the clan for his knowledge in these times in many cultures. But the clan had not wanted to cooperate with him at age 15, that was only to be expected. Okonkwo thought that it would yield to their family easily, and they could never come over - which them never did because they died too young - before they could be asked questions. "Where did you bury your children?" she had asked Ezinma. She was nine then , just recovering from serious illness. "What is iyi-uwa?" she asked in return. "You know what it is. You buried it in the ground somewhere so that you can die and return to the torment your mother." She looked at her mother, whose eyes, in some pleading, were fixed on her. "Answer e to bury everything at once," he said, with others clinging beside her. All the time, her friend and some of the neighbours too. "What is going to happen to me," the medicine man told Okonkwo in a relaxed environment. He turned again to Ezinma. "Where did you bury your children?" Then they bury children," she replied, and the patients murmured to themselves. "You should walk around and show me the spot," said the medicine man. A crowd set out with Ezinma leading
