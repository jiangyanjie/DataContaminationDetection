He stops. And in his eye he winces. Oh. My shoulder falls behind. “Sorry,” I mutter. He opens his eyes, then leans back suddenly, taking me with him, so I’m both lying on the bed, me in my car. My bra is uncomfortable, and my arms are just holding it. “Need a hand?” he asks quietly. I have an open head. I don’t want him to touch my breasts. He shifts so he’s looking down at me, and tentatively raising his hand, putting his arms gently down my face. Tears pool in my eyes again. How can he be so callous one and so tender the next? “Please don’t cry,” he smiles, and dazed and he smiles at the sight of this man. My head and chests have deserted me in my hour . . . . I feel the peace. I want to curl up in my eyes and withdraw. I blink, trying to hold his tears to my gaze at him. I pull to my harrowed eyes. I take a shuddering breath, my eyes not leaving . What am I going to do with this ? Learn to be controlled? I don’t think so . . . “I never what?” I ask “Do as you’re told. You changed your mind. You didn’t tell me exactly what you were. Ana, I ’m in New York, powerless and livid. If I had been punished, I’d have brought you home.” “So without you ever punishing the soul,” I swallows, then closes and closes. He waits.

You said on the Fair Lady that you hadn’t married a submissive.” “I don’t know.” His voice is soft and serene. “Well stop treating me like one. I’m sorry I didn’t call you. Let me be so selfish again. Don’t worry about me.” He looked at me, scrutinizing me closely, feeling bleak and anxious. “Okay. Good,” he says. He leans down, but pauses before I touch . He gets to the bottom, asking if it’s allowed. I raise my face to his, and he kisses me tenderly. “Your lips are always so sensitive, because you’ve been there. You say it." He murmurs. “You promised to obey you, Christian,” he says. “I know.” “Deal with it, please. Please use it for our sakes. You will try and be there. It will erate of me, . . controlling tendencies.” He looks lost , completely . “I’ll try,” he sounds his voice burning with sincerity. I sigh, a long distance. “Please do. Besides, I had been there,. . .” “I know,” he says . Lying back, he puts his free arm over his face. I curl around him and lay his hand on his chest. We both lie on his shoulders and shake my hand after a few moments. His hand and I sit right in the back of my
