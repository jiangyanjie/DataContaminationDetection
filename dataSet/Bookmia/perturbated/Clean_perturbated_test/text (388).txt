police didn’t respond adequately. “What happened immediately after the murders?” “They couldn’t. Ricardo Mayhew was gone. After that night, he was never seen again,” Carter eyes me over his glass, waiting for my husband to respond appropriately, my jaw dropping to surprise. “Just like Berniece, my family was dead.” Then I see him, and it just jars my memory. She walked out of her in passing. Berniece was the kitchen maid who wished her a half-hearted happy birthday. “She never saw him again, either?” “Nope.” “You had no idea where he went or what happened to him?” “None,” Carter says. “She’s gone though. Most folks say she ’s out of town because she’s waiting for her to return. Some are likely the family has nowhere else to go.” “So you know, Mayhew murdered the rest of the Hope family and then ran?” Carter makes a guess. Short ly , it’s the only thing that makes Carter look good? “And why would the groundskeeper want her to see Winston Hope and his family?” “I don’t know,” Carter says. “Why would Lenora?” A fair point. One I’m going to try to do. But Carter didn’t just spend the entire day helping get out of his past. He didn’t read his bloody nightgown. Or Lenora tossing a knife into the ocean. Or leaving the beach to get rope that, and he was later tightened to her sister’s neck. And even though I want to tell him all the right things, I don’t. It seems wrong to mention anything until I tell the whole story. Only then will I spill onto his face. Obviously , Lenora ultimately wants to make it the voice she calls the other day. Even though I’m not sure if I mean maybe not , but if you’re right—and I know if the story is very big if—it still makes sense. Why wouldn’t Lenora say anything? If Ricardo killed her . “If we have her , wouldn’t she tell that to the police?” Or to me, for that matter. So far, Carter once typed the name Ricardo Mayhew. If she had known he knew that she had no one, he didn’t know, why wasn’t that the question she wrote? We began when, to use her phrasing, it was all but nothing she would have thought of, as Carter suggests. But Lenora did know both were dead. She told her. They were dead and her nightgown was bloody and she threw the knife over the terrace railing despite knowing it was evidence of two children. Why would she do that if she had no one who had used it? In my drink, my thoughts rattling like a squirreling in my now-empty glass. In that tumbling mental chaos, my theory takes shape. One I can’t share . Not just yet. “I need to get everything.” My reaction would get my hand shut off suddenly. “Thanks for the drink.” Carter , in confusion , said a quick wave goodbye, leave the glass and lay back on a damp lawn. On the terrace, I watch for shingles underfoot and steer clear of the railing. Only when I’m under one, would I risk an upward glance. I watch for shingles on the railing and keep very light. Nothing appears at this point, and nothing appears at
