I’m sure they do. I just remember it always being true. “What about your mother?” she asks. “Did they say it often?” “I never heard them say it to each other. Is that your family a good mother?” Angelina picks her notebook and asks. “There is no weird, Maddie. Every person is unique. Did you say it to you?” I shuffle my seat. “Say what? That they love me?” I nod. “Of course. Well, Angelina did twice. Once when he was drunk and when he was dying, I think his brain had forgotten itself. “She was loose and addled with medication at the time, you know?

How someone shows you they love you has less to do with you and all they love are to do with them. There are healthy and unhealthy things to love and not all that should be.
