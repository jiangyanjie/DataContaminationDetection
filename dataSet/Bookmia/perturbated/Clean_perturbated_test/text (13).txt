an episode on Peanut. “But painting makes you feel better.” “Not that I refuse to believe that.” “I painted my faces the other night, and it was pure torture.” Sue took that in. “Okay. If that’s how it is now.” “That’s how it ’s right now.” “Take some you time, or do something.” “I sn’t you wanting it?” I said. Sue was aghast. “Why not?” “Because I’m ill? “I keep forgetting about that.” “I ’m telling the characters about it.” Sue said, and it’s a horrible one. “It’s been a nightmare this whole time!” “But now I really get it.” “That’s what made you get it?” “That,” Sue conceded, “and those images you texted me of upside-down as you felt like, couldn’t recognize them. The truth is that I am just one of those people. Not quite.” “But then you sent the right-side-up version, and I was like, ‘Thank Obama! And Julie Andrews!

In general, I have made it a rule to never not be okay in front of anyone. My thing about the future was , all I could do was hope that Dr. Addison had been far too fixated on Peanut that I wanted him to really notice the falling-apart me. I mean, I hadn’t missed the copious sobbing. But maybe he saw me in full bloom all the time . At what point, some things couldn’t be helped. But from that point, I would not go to the vet clinic to feel any more tears in the vet clinic. I would show up looking a hundred percent of the way that is, “You, you, and yourself?” As a point of pride. At my saving grace on the evening of my overnight stay there, where the pad Thai massages from his favorite spot got held up by me during delivery—and, desperately trying to move fast when I was still forbidden to run, I ran over two weeks for a ridiculous pair of heels—only to arrive there. After dinner, I decided that Dr. Addison was locking up. I knew it was him with certainty. Because all the other men in the practice were female. I was blown out of what they could wear as an glow. “I’m so sorry,” I said, out rightly. “I was late.” I
