Judy caught her eye at the time and seemed to be laughing. “Next Thursday is the day for the Christmas Spectacular. I’ll leave a ticket for you for the six-o’clock show. Is this right? You’ll come?” Judy gave Judy a smile: “I’ll be there.” CHAPTER THIRTEEN The first two shows of the evening went by in a whirlwind , and she adored the applause and the smiling faces of her friends who waited for autographs outside the stage . They came past them, apologizing profusely, in order to meet Judy at the Rehearsal Club. She’d asked her sister—over a rushed call—to come early so she could properly start and follow her around her new steps. Judy saw how well she was and would report back to him, hoping his curiosity might get the best out of her, and he’d overcome his stubbornness.
