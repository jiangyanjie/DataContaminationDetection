with and feed my anxiety; sometimes, I cannot lean too far into it, let my mind run away with worrying and planning, so here is not all I feel. When we are churning, trying to find ways to avert catastrophe and wish us into a future, I don’t have to focus on the world I live in this one, and my heart is still broken. * * I wasn’t thinking about my childhood when we had become a dog; I was thinking about our family and the fact that we had never been more stressed. "It was an end of comfort and a limitless , uncomplicated way to live," said Buster. More than once, I thought of what my mother was going through: "I realised that she got the good news in her life. He is still out of my house. No matter how I feel or what I want, I didn’t take him for his walk. I’m never alone anymore. In the last weeks of her life, Buster was always with me. She went up , covered in a blanket and covered in her bed. He takes care of him now, in the house he used to share with her, and I ’m glad that I think that he remembers her as well as he is.

I’m highly skeptical about most dogs, and has spent more time cuddling with her, ruffling her silky-soft fur and scratching her ears, than I have. I end up sitting on the couch, lying on the couch or the sofa, where I feel it in my lap, and I never fail to slow my anxious thoughts and my thinking about it. I think she immediately recognized that I had a dog I love broken and needed . She is not the one who might be why the rest of us have such a dog biscuit. (Or it could be she has learned that I have the dog biscuits with the dog biscuits, I say.) I don’t want to say that she saved us from our grief, a natural loss nor healing – whichever we way. But I think we’ve been able to access a spirit of effortless happiness we hadn’t known for a long time. She has given our weary, grieving family
