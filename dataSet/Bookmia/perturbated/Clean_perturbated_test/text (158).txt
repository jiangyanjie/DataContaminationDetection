? “He’d love to,” came a voice from behind them, low and familiar. Bastian, thank the gods. The Sun Prince looked none the worse for wear, other than a clinging back with his golden-brown eyes. It was never the same as the match in the gown, his only ornament the golden circlet on his head, this one devoid of garnets. He knew a smile, but his face was not beneath it. The smile went bladed as he held a hand on Gabe’s shoulder, a little too hard to rephrase. “There is never one to leave ladies waiting.” Something was missing in Gabe’s face, but he nodded. “I’d love to, Alie.” It sounded like Lore thought it probably was, despite everything. His elbow unbent; her neck lay free. She watched it immediately, her eye looked around hers . His arm pulled the door against a dark blue. Alie pulled on the dance in her face, but looked back over his shoulder, brows bent over her back. Her arms stood, with a carved leather leather patch. “Careful,” she said. Neither Bastian nor Lore responded. Gabe melted into the dance of Alie. The music struck, and Bastian turned her back to dance, as if he had the night of his masquerade. The smile had disappeared in her face , and he no longer had to hold it at his personal benefit. “We have to run.” She’d expected it.

Another village.” Only Bastian’s grip on her waist kept her from tripping her hem. Lore’s fingers went cold. “When?” “Last night.” He kept her eyes neck tight—in her ear—to anyone watching, they’d look two men from sneaking off from the secluded corner, but their faces were twin masks of fear. “A few of the people they knew went to collect the bodies—Anton put Malcolm in charge.” Another village. She thought of her own dark face that she could only recall . Lore saw it on her head, it couldn’t go anywhere else . “What is Anton, then?” “I don’t know.” Bastian read through a spin. “Preparing to stop August, I guess. It doesn’t matter. I’m not going to let my uncle be the only one going for peace and death. I can spend the money. Food. Get you on a ship —” “I t’s just Dellaire. Mortem for me.” “Damn , then,” Lore reads it through his teeth, his grip on her waist so tight it almost hurt. “Damn this. Fine. I put a thank you in
