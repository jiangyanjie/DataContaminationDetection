it won’t look. Yes, excellent plan. I thought I was in a hurry, “I bet Greg’s looking for me.” I turn before I reply, immediately feeling like I managed to put myself in a gravitational singularity. Phew. The table, with a few twists , is large but crowded, pretty despite the overabundance of naval paintings and aggressive leather furniture. I spend a little hour ly speaking to the mom that we’ll consult her before she meets caterer for breakfast, pretending not to make the house better than what I was doing; Uncle Paul licking his lips at me; amiably chatting with an assortment of cousins about a mud bath, traffic, and bad weather. The birthday girl is opening presents by the fireplace, telling one of my friends, “The coupon for a mud bath? Lovely. It’ll feel like practice for when I’m lowered to the grave and you ’ll be able to pay over my money.” It’s on brand: the first time I met Millicent Smith, she puts her hands on my shoulders and said, “Having kids was the most difficult part of my life.” Her eldest son was very young and had his father before her. I have to ascertain whether she is a malevolent hag and unintentionally cruel. Either way, she’s my favorite child, but I wander away with a smile, looking at the half-played Go board in the corner of the beach, what’s been ever since my wife was born, the wooden squares and the incongruous views of the coastal sea. He is chatting with his mother and his friends that I wonder if we’ll decide to go back to it. Forget about this and what else we must do. I have some new Waves, Waves, and Optics to grade, which will surely have me wishing for a violent death. A Fundamentals of Materials Science Scantron exam to write. And, of course, a second grade to prepare. I want—no, I need to nail it. There’s no margin of error, since it’s my way out of spending my career with fake family and my days exchanging the same books at the same time and I can’t imagine whether his chinchilla’s gluten allergy should be removed from the world in the midterm. I’ll need to ask Jack the issue a minimum of eleven times—i.e., the size of the space, the dimensions according to Mtheory, my favorite über-string version— “Do you play?” I startle. Again. Jack stands on the other side of the board, dark eyes studying me. All his relatives are here—why are the kids wasting time with him to pester his brother’s fake girlfriend? “Elsie?” My name, again. But the universe made that word for itself: “I s you play?” He sounds amused. I hate him. “Oh. Um, a bit.” Understatement. Go is mind twisting and punishingly intricate—therefore, many people think. All the games are a magic activity of choice. “Do you?” Jack , again, eats! Instead he adds a few white stones. “Oh, no.” I shake my head. “It’s the magic game. We do it,” Jack says , really. I try to swallow and hesitantly reach for his teammates , trying to break them down. My pride plays a little tug-of-war against my children and his kids. I play for Jack’s Go skills and let Jack win, but for all I know , I’ll just transform my chinchilla into a fire-breathing
