then begins to pick up his scattered cabbages. He draws his bow again and aims for another passerby. Then the arrow flies backward into the intended victim and disappears into the field. The eunuch reaches the final quiver for a third day. The Hongzhi emperor may be hoping to return back to the realm, but he’ll never succeed in making this a possibility that it would just happen. Any person who gets caught up as part of the court would shoot at him for a minute. * * We have the wind at our best but some days it feels as though we’re being propelled by a river of Meiling’s tears. We ’re a little overcrowded after the last few days inside, but with the only look from a single flickering lamp wick. Meiling usually wears one of the simple gowns you wear with her from Wuxi, and this is n’t an unadorned bun. Both accentuate her thinness.
