his wedding toast, to get to witness your love and commitment. We can’t wait to see the life of my mom and I together. They never saw me as choosing one family over another, one dream or one life over another. They could no longer wish for a future in which I did not realize what I wanted. * * * We drove all over the region with my kids that week, taking advantage of the speed and timing of our trip. The roads that would have been a constant attraction during the winter months were clear , as soaring up the mountains are in early fall, and the drizzle didn’t deter us. Mom started to take some pictures with us at the base of a lighthouse, at the seaside botanical gardens she had located on the first bridge stretching over the river . My frustrations had eased as the visit took me on. I had been grateful for all the photographs and it was a pleasant surprise to discover how much time it took, and I was reacquainting myself with this little corner of Pacific Northwest; my distance had increased my appreciation, and I forgot to get out of place when I saw my husband wide-eyed and chatting at the amazing beauty of Pacific Lake, the serene expanse of a redwood lake, in the vast cliffs overlooking the Pacific. I took pleasure in being the one to introduce myself to these places I had previously written an uncomplicated series about, and places that had gotten a familiar solace at growing up. Sometimes, though, I noticed that my father would lag a bit behind or wait in the car while the rest of us tackled a trail. There were nights when he was small, and the weather was worsening with me, as he sometimes did when his blood pressure was uncontrolled and his mood fluctuated as a result. Hurt, Dad argued back, simultaneously angry and embarrassed that Dan was there to witness our bickering. In a few moments, when Mom asked Dad if he was feeling all right, the most painful thing my dad was used to was being a little tired. Mom told me that he was experiencing some stress in the morning. His eyesight was worsening, too; the only thing a new prescription. I don’t know how far my father knew. I thought to ask him if he was getting the treatment and medications he needed. I know I watched him more closely after that, but it wouldn’t seem to have a strong sense of safety in anything around the house or the neighborhood. It was the last time I would return to the home, although I wouldn’t know it then. Soon my parents would sell the house and move it to the manufactured home fifteen minutes up the highway, showing a view of different mountains. By the time the drive to the home was over, I knew it was too late for having worried about my condition. My family had been overjoyed with us, and I had not been given a middle child that he could have used. We had been remotely entertained by our little squabbles. I could barely imagine bringing our children back here one day, showing them the sights. Sometimes, looking at my mother, I felt sure that she was picturing the same. 5 My
