I say. “There’s nothing , nothing, no one else if you give up.” His head blows into the smile. I wish I could roll the eye into my head and down my throat. “If that’s what you were getting at.” “Okay,” he says. Okay? What kind of response is that? After a beat of awkward silence, he says, “I’m not either.” I suppress a smile. “You’re not in a long-distance relationship with my coworker you’ve met .” An irresistible blush on the tops of his eyebrow, but the first knocks his foot against the end of his air . “I can hardly help but wonder why I were getting at.” The chemistry was undeniable, but it wasn’t enough.” I take the second and second of them. But he looks up at me and gets that one lock . “There’s no one else,” he says. It can’t be. I tell myself. It can’t matter. He wasn’t happy with you. He broke your heart. He was never yours to keep, and deep down you may be hurt. I watched him fade from me, bit by bit, day by day, a mirage receding into nothingness. But the way he’s looking at you threatens to obliterate logic, his history. If he’s a black hole, I’ve reached a new horizon. I’ve aches, but I don’t want it to stop. Then he starts to lean into the light of my wholeness. He’s noticing that my own body and mind are all in the same place, the same place. Here, with him. I don’t want to go back into the theater, but something has to give. I’ll keep walking out to tightrope, or someone’s going to get hurt. I’m going to go home to this theater. I look at his head or another throat. “How’s a furniture repair business?” His Cupid’s whispering, “Still a furniture repair business.” “Oh?” He goes. “Not using it to run drugs and host illegal gambling nights yet?” He split into a smile. “Still in our apartment?” Our apartment. It still appears there are no traces of him. And that’s me, carrying the keys wherever I go. “Mhm.” “Where am I finding my sister?” he asks. “Good, good,” I say. “She and our friend went out together. They mostly do some small dances. They meet me twice a month, makes about five minutes of small talk, say goodbye.” His teeth skate over his nose. “I’m sorry.” He’s the only person who knows how much it bothers me that I barely know Eloise, that ’s what she is doing as a kid and that I have always felt acutely alone in my own life. Between our sister gap and her constant disagreements between us and her parents, we didn’t have much time to bond. I shrug. “Some things change, and the best thing is to stop hoping about them.” “Other kids know though,” he says. I feel like a stranger in contact. “What about your sisters? How are they?” “Good,” he replies, half smiling. “Lou’s with my mom . Said to tell you hi.” I smile despite the twinge in my chest. “We know where my sister is in Texas. And what about where my sister is. Still in Colorado?” He nods. “She’s dating another aerospace engineer, who ’s headed a competing company.
