faerie you may recall—and if you can handle yourself in that regard, but in the harshness of the climate. Though I must confess a lot is evident to this writing—a fascination with the legends you’ve set and the Hidden Ones. I urge you to not write out about your findings—although, if any of the ideas you think I’ve set in motion come to life, I will be redundant. I ’m sitting in my chair. Good God! Surely he has no idea what he’s thinking of somewhere here? Yet what would he have meant for a remark? My fear ebbed wildly as I sat back and imagined Bambleby actually venturing to such a place as this. Oh, he has done extensive work in the field, for sure, most recently organizing an expedition to investigate reports from a new group of Folk in the Caucasus, but the point of fieldwork is one of delegation more than anything else; he settles himself at the nearest thing that passes for a hotel and from there provides directives to the small army of graduate students constantly trailing in his wake. He is much praised for his deigning to provide co-author ship with all his publications and his many publications, but in particular he is committed to defining what those students put up with, and the fact that it would be monstrous for them to realize they did not. I was surprised to convince one of the students to accompany me to Hrafnsvik, which was very unlikely, that Bambleby, despite his charms, would have much better intentions, and that he will not come. The remainder of the letter consisted of assurances of his intention to send me a foreword to my book. I felt a little ill at this—a lot of relief and resentment—for though I still want his assistance, particularly after he scooped me on the gean-cannah changeling discovery, I cannot deny its value. Wendell Bambleby is one of the foremost dryadologists at Cambridge, has to say that I am one of the foremost dryadologists in the world. The one paper , which provides a straightforward but useful description of the diet s and river fae, earned me no doubt a two day period and remains the most widely cited work. I tossed the letter into the fire, determined to get more of a little bit about the arrival of his next letter, which would no doubt be swift if I did not reply with a haste sufficient to his self-regard. I turned to Shadow, curled through his feet. The beast had been curled with his eyes, concerned for a time in which of my panic. I discovered another chilblain upon his paw and fetched the letter which had already arrived for him. I also took the beary comb off a comb through his long fur until his eyes were full of water. I removed my manuscript from my suitcase, then in the protective packaging I laid it upon the table. I flicked through the pages, savouring the light and ness of the heavily lit pages and ensuring they were still in order. It is a huge effort to make it appear presently
