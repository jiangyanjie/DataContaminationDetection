world.” “Are you?” His eyes slide to mine. “Must .” He’s still half smiling, like he is making his Saturday night. “Well, you know, it’s hard work. Lots of sharing. And I can’t take her to watch 2001, which she loved.” “Oh my God!” “The Beautiful Woman in the World is delighted. She’s looking great too.” “Then it’s hard work.” “A masterpiece. Despite all the differences he still depends on the predictability of the ‘evil space Siri’s’ arc.” He opens his eyebrow. “I got bored.” “You always got bored at this time.” She presses her shoulder . “I have to confiscate his phone and poke him ,” “This movie would always take me away.” “The world was boring movies.” He cuts his arm through the coat. “If it were up to him to watch Jackass.” “It was too high, too many.” He savors. I cannot stop the tears thrown between the two of them framed by the snowflakes. The easy banter. The snow. The eyes. The snow. The woman’s fingers, still around his face, are slimy and gloomy behind my sternum. “So,” Cece butts in, “how do you guys know Elsie?” “I don’t, actually,” the woman says with a curious look at me. “how do you know Elsie, Jack?” His eyes are fixed on me again. “She dated my brother. Among them... . . The atmosphere changes instantly. The air was already icy, dense , the promise of snowstorms, but the air was colder . The parse less, flurry of Jack’s words.

It’s an amazing way to meet us as a family with George.” She halts. “Well, Georgina. So, please, for George.” Her smile is warm and fuzzy—even though I’m a dear friend of me, which she’s been dying to meet. “Georgina Sepulveda,” I mouth, barely audible. The name unlocks a drawer in my brain, full of scientific papers, and conference papers. Sepulveda, young physics hotshot. I’m a fan of her work. She doesn’t look familiar—she is. “Yup, that’s me.” her words are still outstretched. I take it. “I work with George,” she warns. “Okay, technically not yet. But I’ll start that next year. What? Come on, Jack. I got the call. We sent back the signed contract this morning. I can tell people.” She walks up a conspiratorial look. My stomach churns. “I’m a librarian, right? I love libraries.” She ’s embraced by me, Cece sucks in for one to five minutes. Meanwhile, I nod.
