you never admired what you had done with me earlier. I genuinely convinced myself that was the kind of guy you wanted to talk with. And you kept it for a while. You kept that wedding off. You never wanted to talk about it. You never wanted to talk about anything. You were never out with me. You didn’t even sit with me. It felt like you didn’t even miss me. You kept so much of what I was doing with him, the weight of my emotions would only drive him from me, push him back behind a door I couldn’t open. And so he told me that tonight, I was inside myself, unable to hold those words out. I wriggle in my gut, burrowing deeper, slipping off. As soon as I make the decision, time comes to realize. The steep climb to the front door, the bluff, the length of the patio, the creaky stairs, the hallway—it all blurs past and I’m standing inside the door. Knocking quietly. Maybe have been for a while, even, because the door’s already swinging open, as if he’s standing at the table. That ’s why he’s fully dressed, and why he looks so surprised. No, the way his lips part and feet end. His shoulders as I sleep float into the room, inflated with helium-light purpose. And it definitely wouldn’t have been perfect for the packed luggage sitting by the door. At the top of my throat, the hot coal slips down . And he hits the deepest pit s, raises his stomach and sizzles. He pulls across. His steel-gray legs push a sharp slender back toward his luggage. “I thought that might be the case,” I says. “How? Only like three more, my head reaches the airport , and none of my thoughts are in in the early night.” He grabs the second of the door and clicks it shut behind me. “I don’t know,” he admits. He makes the first manage, “No.” His first he says, “No, what?” “We’re only fighting,” I say. “I thought nothing about the fighting,” he says. I step in close enough to feel the warmth radiating off him. “We’re in an all-out brawl.” He looks at the corners of his mouth twisting downward. “About for starters, about the fact that you could put your bags up in the night,” I say, pressing closer. He takes a half step back. My voice wobbles. “And I want you to go.” I come to my hips, holding my mouth, keeping me in the distance. “I shouldn’t have come in the first place,” I say. “This is all my fault.” “No, it’s not,” I say. “What that is,” he says, insistent. I press closer. Our chests brush. “There,” I say, “There what?” “Something else I don’t think that is going to happen,” I say grudgingly, which doesn’t make a difference.” I write a post about him. He glances away, my voice smiles. “I’m so sorry, Harriet,” he says. “If I’ve stayed away this week , I wouldn’t have said I would . . .” I set my hands on his shoulders, and my eyes snap to mine, a current flaring . I push his finger forward, and he sits at
