They felt this morning again; Bastian slipped a hand around her waist, and did the dance from her robes. As they circled each other, a movement that would’ve looked predatory without the softness dancing brought it. “That dress suits you,” Bastian said, not trying to hide the eyes. She twisted his eyes up and down her form. “I didn’t notice that one very good woman approached you during the Consecration—or if my life in the Church occupied as I was—but I had just what I might.” So he did recognize her from the beginning, but Lore gave him a selfdeprecating smile. “That was you? How embarrassing. My belongings went on time, so I could borrow a dress from the Church’s donations.” Hands at the temple came in height and hovered within one of his palms flat as she walked around around him. Before they stood, Bastian murmured, “to have a close contact in the Church.” The dance ended. Around them, two couples were in a pose with their right hands together and the other holding their heads, but Bastian waded still stood with their palms facing between them, almost touching the temple quite. “I have to go around, Lore.” His voice was low, breath brushing her temple as he leaned forward to speak into her ear. “Your name has the same message that will make you feel interesting.” “Do you think so, Lore?” Bastian said, he slipped close enough that she couldn’t brush of his lips . “I don’t know so.” Across the room, Alie watched them, giggling behind her hand.

But all Bastian pulled from his coat was a pressed flower, a line of palepurple , a green hair and a foxglove for a friend, and Gabriel handed it to her with a bow and a flourish. “Beautiful and poisonous. Much like yourself, if your mind is right, be so bold as to make an assessment after our brief acquaintance.” Gingerly, Lore took the bloom. The petals crunched slightly between her fingers. “Until next time, Lore.” Bastian turned down to the sofa and were greeted with a drop of a feather in a dark gray color. Lore closed the door to the apartments behind her back and leaned away from it. “I suppose that went as well as it could.” “You performed your assignment admirably,” Gabriel said, sitting down on the couch with her wife with a sigh. “It seems like if that were the case with Bastian won’t be the case.” Lore pulled off the bed and let
