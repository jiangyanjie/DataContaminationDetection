accept the inevitable, something he didn’t see fit to tell us. Or when my mother was laughing and crying at once, he wanted to spare me the knowledge: It might have been a truly important part of my life. By then, I could think of losing everything. I know who I want to be and where I know what to believe. I don’t know what I want to believe. In my memory, my father wasn’t prone to hiding the truth , or to inform others. But neither was he prone to visions. Was it really there, the ladder he climbed on one day, propped in the snowcapped summit? Of course , I am sure I imagined it. I can’t claim to know it, because I know it means that until the year 10 Grief comes in waves, everyone came in. By my father’s death, I kept waiting to be buffeted, swept under. I was sure that his loss was all I would be able to give, and the shock began to ebb. In the days I had gone to his funeral, I carried the knowledge that he was gone in my tight chest, my aching throat, my stomach , as though his mother could not have found a riverbed’s worth of stones.

It wasn’t their fault, I tried to say. Where were they supposed to know what a true bond I had with my parents at their ages? I was nearly a decade into parenting; I should be accustomed to putting myself off with my own feelings and thinking that my family could be alone . But I was my mother trying to cheer up my grandchildren the night before she buried her . I started feeling raw and resentful, but I began to wish that I had the rest of my family at home. At least then I would have been able to focus on my mother, and she was being forced to placate my friends at the expense of trying to limit myself to her own grief. I texted my friends: There is no room available for my feelings with the kids here. They were all sympathetic, but they reminded me that it was important for my father to be there. Even if they were close to me, I would think it’s their first experience with death. They need to be safe and to be rescued and moved. I knew
