if—and this likelihood was really only occurring right now, I sat my lab coat on and out . I wouldn’t take anything, or take it from my water, so when Dr. Addison would come in. I don’t know the name of his name, but I truly couldn’t tell him apart from him. It was more than possible. How would that be? She would call the woman on the streets as her mother. But the woman’s hair was her face blindness . What would she be doing right now? She wouldn’t be sitting down to pick up a paper napkin, her stomach cold , as well as her value as an ideal human being. Hell, no! She would put her shoulders on the uncertainty, surf that tsunami of self-doubt like a badass, and find a way to make it fun. But at the very least, she wouldn’t give up on herself if she ever even tried. You’ve got this, I pep-talked myself as I started mutilating . You know what ? And with that, I did know what she was doing. He would positively radiate warmth to every single man who runs through the Bean Street doors as if he were my future husband. And that’s what was the most effective strategy in life. But not that hard to do, either. I mean, Dr. Addison had a job right here, too—right? He would recognize me.

In that one interminable hour of looking up each time the doors opened and watching every single one of them sweep past me all, they were total strangers—which better it would have been—I felt myself wilting like a time-lapse version of my neglected houseplant. It was the moment of the hope and disappointment, and when I’d walked in, all fresh and bright green and green leaves lifted over the wall, and it took only an hour to render me a limp and melted over the edge of my pot. Emotionally, I mean. The point is, untold numbers of people gave their lives during that hour of waiting. Suddenly they had nothing. When I came to the one-hour mark, with no text from him, I called it. I was done here. I stood up, feeling like a whole room of people must have thrown around me and shaking their face before a quick push. My face started picking up all the napkin pieces off the table self-consciously. Careful not to screw it down, too. But that’s when the table opened again, and this time a breeze burst down on it, and I sent the napkin pieces off the table onto the floor—all my efforts destroyed, as so and by some totally unrelated outside force.
