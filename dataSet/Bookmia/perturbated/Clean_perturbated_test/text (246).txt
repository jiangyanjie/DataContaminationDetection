convince myself that things are going to be fine?” “That’s one way to make it better?” “But what if I don’t believe it?” “Then keep on saying that it was something I was supposed to argue myself into feeling optimistic? “I’ve never been great at optimism,” I said. “That’s what the arguing is for.” “I’m not good at arguing, either.” “There is a chance to get better.” But I’d learned long ago that optimism should get you . “Can you give it a hint?” “Try to step back and look at the situation.” Dr. Nicole said. “That’s where you can see it more clearly.” “See what?” “That no matter what happens, you will find a way to see that it is temporary or permanent.” “My proso...” I asked, giving her a halfway -way path. “What’s that?” “That’s the worst I’ll be faced now,” Dr. Nicole said. “I don’t give up on these days” and listened to them. Then she handed me a diagnosis: “My prosopagnosia.” I waited for those syllables to make sense. But they didn’t.
