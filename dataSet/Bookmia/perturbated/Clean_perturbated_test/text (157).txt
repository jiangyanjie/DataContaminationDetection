in the family. As an imperial master, Grandfather also had an interest in education and family welfare. As well as every woman trying to give her husband at least one son, it is his duty to ensure family support is at the bottom line. The best way to accomplish such a job is to give wives only not only love and give birth but also survive. Grandfather, even as her husband, liked to read ancient medical texts. When he served as Grand Master for Governance, he worked in the secondary capital of Nanjing, where he was also an official on the Board of Directors of the Governor of the Republic of Korea. He continued his personal studies even as he spent years away from home, traveling to perform as much as my father might if he passes the next level of imperial exams. When he moved from his home Nanjing, he was the leader of the yi—a “famous ” tradition of the military military. His learning comes from reading ancient texts, and his understanding comes from following her parents, who learned from their parents, who learned from parents, and so on. “Then what do you mean? “David I tell her?” Grandmother asks. He is not just a man of distinction but also the headman of our clan. His word rules, and we are all to obey.

Grandfather lifts my feet. He says, “Answer your feet.” The Three Aunties are Buddhist nuns, Taoist s and fortune-tellers. The Six Grannies are matchmakers, shamans, drug sellers, and midwives.” I recite the list from my list, knowing what some of them and when to get to know it are. “Respectable families don’t allow babies to come into our homes because we follow Confucian ideals,” Grandfather says. “As for the others, they are snakes and scorpions to be avoided , as they cover up the room. “Husband, they do perfectly well that—” “Beyond this,” Grandfather grumbles, “midwives are linked to the world,” like abortion and infanticide. Who is a mother of the sort of midwife who, once represented by a lady who refuses to leave the child palace, cuts off his baby so she might bring it into the world?” Grandmother roars from her head. “This happens on the rarest occasions, and they are often called upon to save their daughters,” Grandfather says. “Their standing is further lowered,” Grandfather continues, “because they’re often called to check a woman’s virginity in court
