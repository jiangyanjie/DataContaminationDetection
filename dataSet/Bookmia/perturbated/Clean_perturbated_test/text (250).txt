trees bent in a storm. Mrs. King spotted guests picking at the gilt-work, estimating the price. “You could tell you , she thought. Winnie had costed them up, the buyers were ready. There were thousands of flowers scattered and their houses looked dull and unsettling. They grew up in the flower arches and the tops of them was covered with silks. A palm tree the size of omnibus lapped at them gently. It was beaded out of white and sprayed with teardrops in the back of the trunk. Mrs. King wasn’t even hanging up. She was seeing Miss de Vries on the clock, then laughing and sitting up there. “How can we get down to it?” she asked. Miss de Vries nodded, curt. “Yes.” “Your father spoke to you just before he died. I imagine he spoke to you, too.” Miss de Vries quickened a half step. “He did.” There was no tension in Miss de Vries’s face. No expression at all. But she could barely speak.
