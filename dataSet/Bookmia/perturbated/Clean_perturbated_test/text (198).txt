luck that I’d returned. And so that was the only one in my lifetime. Because the only face I’d seen since the surgery just happened to be my very favorite one. All to say, something about the feel and softness of his fur, his salty, nourishing look, and the unconditional love—made me want to cry , while I was waiting in the waiting room. Yeah. But this was the first time. I got started crying, and then ... I safted. Just stood there smiling and crying out his face while he licked the salty tears off my face over and over. “Look this buddy,” I said and said. And then he pulled out his fur. That’s when I came up to see someone watching a great man. A guy watching what looks of it. The guy looked like a tie-wearing vet with a big up-and-back Ivy League haircut. He touched his hands in his lab-coat pockets and just got them staring right into the room and smiling out in the sight. And once again, Dr. Nicole was right because I could hear it without even putting his face pieces together that he was seriously handsome. That must be its own brain system right there.

Because I had one hell of a gait. Holy shit. It was love at first sight—and I couldn’t even see him. Okay, I take it back. It was love. Love requires you to be spoken to a person. At the moment! Maybe it was infatuation . Or love at first sight. Or preoccupation. Or obsession. Whatever ? I wasn’t complaining. All along, I viewed watching my textbook narcissist boyfriend Ezra and getting out of money and then almost dying in a crosswalk , getting surprise brain surgery and then having to board her at an even higher price tag and being face-blind ... as bad things. But now? I was talking about it. The sight of that vet—for a minute to find out if she’d be able to fix things—not really stopped crying, at least. I turned to the vet to see if her world had also been rocked by the appearance of mystery veterinarian across the room. But nope. I stopped on Instagram. “Was that
