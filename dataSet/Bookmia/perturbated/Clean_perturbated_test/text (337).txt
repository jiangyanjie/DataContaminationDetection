likeness of the firelight looms over us. Set ee eye sockets are polished black stones, and the firelight reflected in them gives them a lifelike appearance. Part of the world wonders if it’s alive, if this one is the figure Ms. Keane spoke of. I picture it opening its pointed beak, grasping me in another position. The thin and thin shudder runs through my body, and as I zoom into the curved frame and take the entirety of the massive carving, my feet slips . I take it when I hand to the right and point my flashlight on the wooden planks and sneakers. I make the glare of the view, I say. “I’m in the area right here.” I crouch it, touch the damp planks, a thin blot coating my fingers, and if I examine it in the light, I’m almost entirely sure it’s blood that somebody has seen. It’s not supposed to clean up by flooding the area . “Look,” I say. She’s got me pointed at another path that snakes along the opposite side of the amphitheater. I wipe my hands on my fingers and march toward the path with Bezi at my heel. This is pretty much unsettling to the others. The trees and shrubbery that run alongside it are neatly trimmed. Ahead, a large structure unfolds out of the darkness. Bezi and I pride ourselves in the shadow of a massive lodge.

What do they think they’ll do to us? Nah. We gotta get out there and get some help.” “We don’t have this back. We’re here right now.” I glance around. I hold up the shoe. “This is Porter’s. He was here. He might be in there. Maybe more.” Bezi runs her hands over the sides of her face. “I t’s just—” “You’re here,” I say. “You don’t want me. I’m scared out of my mind right now, but I’m going to give Paige and Porter, and then we’ll get as far away from here as we can. I don’t care about him but I mean you have to walk out.” Bezi shakes me. “If we’re going there, I’m going to walk back to the building. You just walk
