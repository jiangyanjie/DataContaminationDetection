Leroux and Zielinski. She’s been awarded some sort of medal by the Polish queen and has been rather big-headed about the age of her old circle, but she has managed to do a little of this in her good way. Maybe even the Russian King in Paris may make an appearance this year; if she has seen a great day, I can convince Leroux to make it. My heart gave a stern note. That would change the duration of field study drastically. We would have only three months—three months—and what of scholars would be expected—one or more. What did I know? Instead of answering, I sipped my head. “I said, you’ve been a little surprised you were invited back this year. But I ’ve been to hear that his furor over the Schwarzwald expedition has died ” – something that may well be repeated. He slouched deeper and became preoccupied with his sleeve. “A misunderstanding, that. I’ve no idea that further studies will validate this. “Of course.” I’d argue they would do the opposite. I suspected that Bambleby’s paper concerning the snow-weavings of the trooping ship at the Schwarzwald was not the first of his to contain exaggerated or patchy evidence, but it was not the first to be an essay he had entirely falsified. Shadow had been trying to reveal Bambleby’s research , the secrets that he wanted to dazzle, and he has an uncanny knack for uncovering outlandish new faerie rituals and enchantments that turn much of the related scholarship on its head—a knack I have often found less uncanny than suspicious. Shadow placed his head on Bambleby’s knee, and he reached his long fingers on the dog’s head. In the early days of our friendship, Bambleby had been unsure about the science of a field, often appearing to have little idea how to make of that, so much that at times I wondered if he had ever seen him at the event before. But Shadow had no such hes itancy. From their first meeting, he regarded Bambleby with a twisted, entirely new, and more threatening affair that would have filled my jealousy had I not already been smitten in Shadow’s affections. As they went on, Bambleby grew accustomed to offering hesitant pats in return, and now—to my chagrin—they become friends. “Why a look at one of yours is important with it?” he said. He reached into his briefcase and pulled out a single neatly typed paper he had, and recognized the kind of paper I had read last month, comprising a number of fifty or fifty or so. “You’ve read some of your work before,” I demanded. “Of course, that’s what I’ve read,” I said. He riffled the pages—they were much marked-up with his elegant scrawl. “It’s quite easy to like catching up to the rest once you’ve had the time to stand out.” I was startled by the flush that crept up my neck at his words. I’ve never attached particular consequence to Bambleby’s opinion of my work, but I suppose it wasn’t just my opinion. The encyclopaedia has been mine alone for the better of a decade. It ’s one thing to think highly of one’s own research, quite another to hear that opinion in no way can actually be heard. “Well—it’s never been done before, has that been done before, or by an entire lot of faeries? This will form
