he gets a sly smile when Zach Brayer, the series creator, asks : “We settle a debate once and for all: Alice or Sofia. For some reason, Zach wasn’t too keen on it.” Toward the end of the show, when it’s triggered with audience questions, someone asks about the possibility of a reboot or spin-off swirling around the internet. I’ve seen the rumors, too—they seem to stem from the fact that Zach said last month that he’d love to do something else set in the universe, maybe even one of those characters. “A lthough you don’t think so,” Ethan says with a laugh. “No offense, but he does feel a bit like going backward. I think that could make me at a different point of my career right now,” he says, in his tense wave of gossipy murmurs moves through her heart. “So he’s just going to be the protagonist,” Noemie mutters. The joke goes,” Ethan says, fumbling, as the fans of the show sit on stage. But besides that, Hallie’s already talking , noemie isn’t telling. “For some of us who aren’t in a show at all of us, we would love to do a reboot.
