she then gave to her. She asked him twenty or sixteen years ago, and then said that he was tired. She took him to bed in their living room, where he’d been unable to sleep the past few nights so he could find her awake and coughing. She heard him clear his throat and cough a few times, but then he was done, and she assumed he’d finally gotten to sleep. When she went in to check on him later— it came so fast. But she said his goodbye had been done. And then she called out for him, and then she shook him. She repeated these times over and over that he didn’t wake. She called 911, and arrived in an emergency room in about five minutes. As soon as I look at her, I try to picture the uniformed strangers trying to save my father; who sat off of the mattress, pushed up their sleeves, and pushed down the chest so hard that the wooden slats of the antique bed frame snapped beneath their efforts. They worked diligently, efficiently, taking turns with air and compressions while they performed and prayed. It took two weeks . What occurs to either of them?

My parents had the privilege of laying down, though not to sleep . She couldn’t stay upright any longer. Thousands of miles away, my phone went on, beside my name. When she says what I can say, she tells me there is nothing she needs , even if I have already called her, and she is no longer able to speak unless she can leave. She says her funeral will be on Thursday evening so I should start looking for flights. She has to go, some friends want her for something, so they will call me later. I tell her that I love her. There is nothing I can’t say. After we hang up, I shout for my husband with a voice I have never heard, and I don’t know how long I have been crying. Maybe I have been all along.
