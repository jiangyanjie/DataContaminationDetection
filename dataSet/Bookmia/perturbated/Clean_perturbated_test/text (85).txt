the rest of my life , I’m reliving my days and nights when my mother was dying and I couldn’t be with her. 22 The entire boxes begin arriving , but I am in the middle of the week. Packed and shipped by my aunts, each box is stuffed with photos, documents, correspondence, religious texts, and other materials. I let them sit in one box for days before I feel able to sift through the contents. Sometimes I tear them open at once, and find items for my family. One holds my two boxes, including an elementary school diploma, a photo, a stub of a song, and a Simon ’s Band concert she’d once told me about, her eyes shining: It was the best concert I’ve ever seen. But amid the photographs I have never seen before, I find my father a bill, a driver’s license, a bill requesting payment from an attorney of my parents in my adoption, and a copy of the will she had written only months before. There’s a wooden box full of bead necklaces: black , black, blue, yellow, royal blue, blue, blue and pink. Did she wear any of these? I wonder. Any of them? The only necklace I can recall seeing my mother wear, at least in recent years, is a sterling-silver Orthodox cross with the heart of her mother’s inlay. My older daughter picks out a necklace of aubergine beads while I lend it to her little sister. After stepping through another box, I don’t see what happens or how the string snaps; I only hear a sudden explosion of beads on my floor. The n there I put them up together, sneaking slightly away at me, but they are completely disappeared. There must be a dozen strings of beads in the box; the necklace that may be missed. Though I can never wear them, I can’t bring myself to get rid of them, or anything that belonged to her loving parents. The boxes, once opened, pile up when I leave my home, and I find notes I wrote to my mom when I was five, and crammed my hearts: Dear Grandma, Well, how are you? How was you? I hope! He tells me that he is still wearing a letter. Well, bye, I love him! I find cards made for her decades later, by my own kids: Dear Grandma, Thank you for the gifts and treats! We miss you. We hope we can visit you soon. I always report cards, paintings, postcards we sent to her, a heart-shaped cardboard picture frame , and a small print printed in either second or fourth grade by gluing hundreds of painted pasta shells into place, just so. I find my father’s Cleveland , Ohio glass, to recall him using as a card. I find a letter taken from my mother by my father, trying to mend a story in a fight, and it feels like something I could never have seen. At the end of the day I find her passport, the ones she had renewed for her planned trip to Greece. She was going to go with her mother with one Dear Dad
