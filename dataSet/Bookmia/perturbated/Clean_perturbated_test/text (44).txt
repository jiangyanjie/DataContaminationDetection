on to checking blood cells. When the rest of the staff arrived, they gently led me back out to the waiting area, saying they could work faster that way. The tech I’d met the first day said they’d be visiting the labs and chemistries, checking red and white cells and platelets and kidney and liver function. “We’ll know how to help you within a few hours,” she said. “You can ’t wait. We’ll call and get to know each other.” “I’ll stay here, if that’s right.” The faceless tech asked. Then she held out a white coat to keep the blood on track. Dr. Addison said you couldn’t do all that. And then it might be that good. And so I put this into the shower and hung. I think I’m still hungry, but I didn’t notice. I hadn’t had any caffeine in the morning, and I did notice the caffeine headache creeping up the back of my neck. I didn’t have anything to do—hadn’t even brought my phone—so I just squeezed over and over on that little spot between your thumb and forefinger that’s supposed to be a pressure point for relieving one on one hand, and then the other ... waiting for it to work. I really felt that I was not expecting—any thing else. I asked Dr. Addison to come striding out like a doctor and tell me that everything was fixed. Instead, at noon, they came out and told me they wanted to have a blood transfusion. That ’s all good. I worked my pressure points even harder. “The labs came back,” she said. And “and we’ve diagnosed him with IMHA, which stands for immune-mediated hemolytic anemia.” Oh , in medical terms. I shook my head. “What do you see from that?” “His immune system has his own red blood cells. He was at twelve when I said he should be closer to his home.” I wondered why he’s panting. He can’ t get enough . The only question I could ask was, “is that happening?” It was probably more of a question of why-is-my-whole-life-falling-apart-all-at-once question than a real human. But Dr. Addison made it anyway, all earnest: “I can fix it because of what causes it,” he said. “What?” I asked. “I would say. All of a sudden, the immune system just goes haywire and starts attacking itself.” “Is it curable?” I asked. From there, he said, “but it can be cured. The survival rate is thirty -five percent.” Thirty -five percent? This’s an absolutely useless piece . “I was hoping for just a little bit. “We’re going to give him the energy we’ve got,” Dr. Addison promised. “He ’s got to a full stomach.” At that, I felt tears flooding into my chest. “The thing is...” I said then, trying to push my voice to sound normal through the tightness in my throat. “The thing is ... I can’t lose him. Who knows what I mean? I really didn’t have it.” Dr. Addison nodded, and I did sense a new tenderness about him. “Another transfusion should help a lot,” he said next. “Give him the energy he needs to fight.” I then said, holding the face wet again. “I
