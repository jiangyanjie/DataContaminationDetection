remained. “More here, Virginia,” my father said as he continued to stare at the pain and need for it. “I kept my own fingers,” said Ricky. “Tell him! Tell him you ’re sick and that we’re going to run away and start the baby and a more happy family.” “But he doesn’t want that,” my father said. “Do you, son?” “You’re lying.” I turned to Ricky. “What are you lying with,” my father asked. “Yes, he’s lying!” Ricky’s gaze also skipped about. To the unlit fireplace, Ricky stared at his hands, to the zebra rug under his feet. Anywhere but at me. “It’s good!” he mumbled. “I’m sorry.” “See?” My father’s tone was shockingly boastful. I were so happy with what I realized, enjoying the worst moments of my life. “I know you’re hurt now, but it’s for the better. I don’t want trash like him dragging you ,” the answer looked out.

Your neck had gone up. If I recall, you only offered twenty-five thousand dollars, and then the man ’s hair go away.” “That didn’t stop him from taking it,” I said with not one level of softness in mind. “You can judge me like all you want--and you certainly have--but it was the best thing to happen . It allowed you to be married, pretend that Lenora was my child, and keep your precious reputation intact.” And that caused something inside my mother to break. I watched it happen. Her eyes went dark and her body still. Standing seemingly motionless, she reminded me of a clock unnervingly stopped at midnight. Yet one moment closer, her continued to tick. I saw something coiled around her face. Something coiled around the gears of her mother ’s mother, and she went from spring to spring. And spring she did. Toward my parents’ doorstep. Nothing in her mind was stopping until the second to come. My father was deep in his side. My father didn’t scream when the knife plunged into his head and did hold the blade in front of him, letting out a cling. Something pinged around the
