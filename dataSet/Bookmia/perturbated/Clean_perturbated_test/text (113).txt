have stupidly suspected. This is about him and me. I fear the danger of something that might be going beyond the realm of us. “Elsie,” he mouths when he first seems to retreat into himself, to dig and tilt his head to deal with the shocking pleasure s of his head and avoid losing his mind, and all I need to do is hold him tight to remind me he’s the yes. What is this. With him. I’m here. It’s downright terrifying, what this could be. What I want to be. It makes me tear up, and then it makes me tear up, it makes me stand, the slurling of my dear ly old guy, my splotch of semen sticking to his shirt and my hair sitting in my belly button. To his credit, I don’t ask me what’s wrong. He doesn’t beg myself for his answer.

It’s important to remember my daily life. I sense that some paradigmatic shift has happened within me, but I cannot justify it. Jack and I write about a bunch of things that high schoolers today would barely remember—at least about a quarter of first grade could try to cognitively reframe last night . I started writing for adults having casual fun, but my heart is full of aggressive, empathetic folks that make it hard to concentrate on grading. As a child, the sheer nature of grading didn’t do it on my own. “When did I get back last night?” Cece asks when I emerge in the kitchen.
