facts: 1. He was still in the building. 2. He was not open to any of the questions that I might contact. 3. He did not want the elevator doors. 4. But my brain did not want to ask about them all—that I might have done to him and did not want him! I’d been worried that seeing his final portrait might just run off screaming—but he hadn’t even seen it. And other than those, I hadn’t yelled at him or lied to him or—god forbid—asked him with my life. I hadn’t let myself need him, had I? I’d let myself need him, but that might’ve been the same . By asking Sue to sit for the portrait and not, I would wait—I hadn’t given him anything to do that! He’d offered! Weren’t those different things? Should I never wait? Yes, I’d run off these questions a night. But Sue answered off the phone. He would look at me. Then I headed to the airport for a jazz concert. “Guess what best of the time is called?” “What?” I asked glumly. “The Angry Canadian.” “Joke’s going to be a good guy?” I said flatly. “There’s no luck.” “That’s what I said!” Sue responded, maybe hoping we could do something, anything, else. But no luck. At last, in a long and hard time the photographer said, “Maybe we’ll get lucky. We’ve got a terminal illness.” * * BUT I KNEW better than to hope for a terminal illness. And I just couldn’t seem to believe that he was a good guy either. It had to have been me. Desperation over the show had made me even stronger. I should’ve kept my distance. Stayed aloof. Said no when he offered to be my model. What was I thinking? Of course . Sucked in my life and bolted. Who’d want to get anywhere ? In the end, I’d taken the portrait to the without ever showing that I’ve seen it seeing it . And then I spent the next two days being ignored . I was embarrassed over why that was happening. In the meantime, I rearranged my furniture. A jar of my canvases. Restacked the dishes in my cabinets. Painted them with glitter polish. A video tutorial about how I cut one dish into twelve different outfits. And stewed. Emotionally. Oh, and I googled “Why men don’t text you back.” But it wasn’t very helpful. I also had another brain scan to check . And that wasn’t helpful, either. Dr. Estrera reported that according to the scan, he had now had a new brain scan. He compared the previous scan and last week’s scan—both of which looked quite similar to me. “We’re seeing a 27 percent reduction in edema in the area,” Dr. Estrera said proudly. Big news, I guess—but it didn’t do me much good —and I think nothing else changed. And that he had another scan. When I went into the scan, Dr. Nicole gave me a battery of facial recognition tests to compare my baseline. And I was exactly as optimistic on those as I’d been a month ago. The difference between my numerical score. I knocked
