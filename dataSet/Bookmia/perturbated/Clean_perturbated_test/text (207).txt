ever remember seeing, Mom . This was his place on my hand. Quite a send-off. My father never feels even farther away and I am going to this place to find him . I’m walking down the river; he never met, wondering whether he knows what my mother is facing; we are going through without him. I turn around, the mountains a reassuring wall at my back, and let Buster take home for lunch. 16 On Sunday night after Christmas, I took my mother out to her favorite diner. My husband, kids, and I had flown to Oregon to spend the week with her, and my sister, Cindy, and her family made the trip down from Portland with a carful of Christmas decorations to deck the halls of our Airbnb.

As I unhooked Buster’s leash and washed it at the kitchen sink, I asked Mom what they wanted . She thought for a while it named her wish: a Reuben sandwich from the diner one town away. My mom suddenly set off in the rental car, and I found myself wishing we had farther . It was an afternoon of cold, sunlit beauty in the sunshine.
