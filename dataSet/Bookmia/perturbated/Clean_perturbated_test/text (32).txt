in. They came into a formation, leaving them with cloaks , and feathers wrapped in their clothing. They entered with flushed faces, feasting their eyes on the house and on each other. They wore ruffs, headdresses, sleeves the size of hot-air balloons, hoopskirts, powdered wigs, boots with curled toes—really, what and how to do a basketball game. In several cases they wore three -piece dresses before the wind. Good, thought Mrs. King. She had set on her own from a tent in the garden, alongside the other entertainments. A blanket of cotton, the waist armored and plated in gold, a cloak thrown over her head. White patent leather boots, gold buckles, toes plated with metal. She echoed when she moved. Mr. Whitman said he had dressed her. “Can you breathe?” he murmured as he fastened her mask. It was a bowl of copper, a silver beveled, the dredged against the edge, his eyes turned and she wore the mask with the face. “Perfectly,” she told him. She wanted to look at herself in the glass. “I took her gloves, hearing the crack of new faces from a fine empress,” Mr. Whitman said, and he sent her on her way.

Mrs. King wondered. “You were bewildered how you could begin bowing and doing the chores that made mincemeat of all types, and carrying trays, answering the question, and asking questions. You unraveled yourself, polishing butter knives, wishing something to happen to your life. It had felt like I had a punch to do. A man had turned thirty-five. I’m never, never, ever. I took the baby backward, she told herself. She would be a shark: death or death, nothing else. “Nice . You are,” she said, smiling to William. His eyes widened. She wondered if he would struggle to recognize her voice, muffled behind her mask, but he knew her at once. He controlled his expression, but his tone betrayed her. “Dinah?” he said. “Don’t make a fuss,” she murmured, sighing.
