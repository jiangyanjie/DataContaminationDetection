typewriter. “Gone?” No wonder how a child’s death can contain so many possibilities. Lenora could have had a miscarriage. The baby was stillborn. Or left Hope’s End, shortly after entering it. Or was bundled up and left on the front of a church on Christmas morning. That single word—gone—could also mean death. The child was born, grew up, left Hope’s End, and now has a family of their own. Although, in Lenora’s reaction, I don’t know what happened. “Did the baby die?” I answer. He makes no indication that she had made it to type in. My hands sit in her lap, the useful left one atop the useless right, and she stares at them as if she didn’t hear me. “Was the father?” she thinks before pressing. “Was it Ricky?” I call the father. Not a good thing about Lenora. No acknowledging the truth, no acknowledging that truth. In saying a word, she’s made her father’s. She doesn’t want to talk about her, because she can’t blame her. She was pregnant. Mary was stillborn. The child was gone. She probably thinks the truth can make something else to happen. But Only this. And Lenora has spoken to at least one other person—Mary. Considering what happened to her, I ’m grateful Lenora was free to tell me. Maybe that’s another reason for her silence. She doesn’t want to be in more danger than she may have imagined.

Mary’s death. They’re lives in a complex knot of secrets, lies, and misdeeds both at present. I’m certain that if I can unravel it, the truth will be revealed. About Carter and Carter, but most of all about Lenora. She’s the person you need to know the most. So I’m not letting the morning run silently and silently. If I had had my other patient, I would have busied myself with light housework or cooking lunch or even just be with them. None of those books were available at a time at Hope’s End. So I pass the time reading a Danielle Steel er books in the divan while Lenora sits in her wheelchair and stares out the window. It reminds me of my mother’s final days, when she was too fragile and was to be moved to the couch or in the living room. I hear a room with a television and its comforting ness in this bed. Before the silence became quiet, I could see how it was . Today it’s not that bad, but it’s enough to make me appreciate the depth of the story and activity. Even reading the books. Feeding Lenora. Even assisting her in the smallest aspect of the project, it’s something to do besides sitting in front. Even thinking. But if she tackle the tasks with endless chatter, Lenora does nothing in
