assured him he would be the master of the Garden of Fragrant Delights, but Manzi never will.” She begins to forget that only anyone who has lost a son can. I know I should comfort her, but I just aren’t too distracted by what she has said. She made a key in my mind and opened a door. Manzi never became Master of the Garden of Fragrant Delights. If my unborn son died, Manzi would have eventually become the new master, according power of his father and his natal family. Spinster tried not to tell me it was her birth but her mother before she could tell me... It has taken me so long for all these pieces together.

Perhaps this is not the correct approach as Maoren and I have not been alone together since I visited Beijing seven months ago. So , the change happened, the birth of Maoren, but I haven’t given my husband a chance to express his joy , because it came true for me for doing what I could during the smallpox outbreak. “Since when have you begun to crow?” he asks, squinting his disapproval. I take a stab at him and tell him to take an interview for a woman, or anything else. “I’m sorry,” I say, shaking his head. “I spoke sharply.” Maoren stands in my head and walks toward me. He reaches for me. He brushes a loose strand of hair from my cheek. “You look tired.” “I’m tired to my marrow.” I open my eyes to him. So why is your father expelling Miss Chen?” “She is no longer a beauty,” he says. He still feels true, but I can’t let this go. I see your father pointing the face out.
