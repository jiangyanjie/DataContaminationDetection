said Bunny, reaching for Marion’s suitcase and lugging it up the steps. Marion followed, unsure of what exactly was going on. The door opened and the door opened. It was a large space for a couple of girls around their age were chatting loudly, seated on couches and chairs that looked more like a bar. They had been playing the game for the last century. Posters from these days hung on the walls, along with other famous people, including Ellen Terry and Sarah Bernhardt. The clatter of dishes drifted up to the lower floor. “Where did they come?" Marion asked . “Where did you live n they came? A boardinghouse for girls in the street?” “This is where we live!” “Sure thing. We are four people.” “Middle,” who runs the place, loves us because we get a steady paycheck and never fall behind on our schedule. We are five girls , two wannabes, with a few comedians and opera singers thrown into the mix, but we try not to hold it against them. Comes with room to live.

A gray-haired woman in a simple gray dress joined the desk, before she looked up and smiled, her eyes with warmth. “What can I do with you, dear?” she asked Bunny. “Mrs. Fleming, my friend , is a new Rockette and needs a place to have an extra room . When we got out of the room, I’d be happy to share with her.” “Don’t they get a seat?” said Mrs. Fleming, Marion, gesturing to the sofa. “I’ve got to get back to Radio City,” said Bunny. “Meet me at the stage door at ten and we’ll grab dinner.” Bunny ’s a kiss and disappeared. After she went by the stage, she picked up a clipboard and pen. “Congratulations on becoming a rockette. Now, when it comes to full name?” “Marion Brooks.” “Do you have a good picture of your name or your name?” “Real name.” “Lucky you. I’ve heard
