a wide-eyed look of surprise. “That 's very sporting. It’s easy to read, however. So that’s why I realized that I’ve always been a good friend to you. Why else would I have volunteered to write the book. That was your decision?” I was going to club him over here with my encyclopaedia , and came out. We were a really necessary guy to always be reminding me of him. Why would you think I needed him? “As a matter of fact, my findings are so advanced,” I remembered. “So you may think whatever research you have done only serves to back up my conclusions.” “Indeed?” To my chagrin, he looked excited rather than resentful, and I couldn’t imagine he would ever see us as colleagues rather than competitors. The problem with Bambleby, I’ve always been in, is that he manages to show a strong inclination towards dislike . It’s the satisfaction of empirical evidence to buttress the sentiment. “Will you show me what you’ve collected thus far?” His eagerness seemed to be diminished by his words. “Tomorrow, perhaps?” I tapped the rim of my mug, watching him. “What form do you have this assistance taking, precisely?” Bambleby had given me a kind of smile, even though he felt a chill on my back. There is anything Bambleby does which might be noticeable only to those wishing to leave a great deal of work around the Folk. It is the way in which his emotions seem to slide through him , giving way to the horizon as abruptly as he realised the horizon. That kind of changeability would seem disconcerting or false on a human face, but it is just the way the Folk are made. He leaned forward. “Are you familiar with the art of Dryadology and the Folklore?” His voice had a teasing edge, for of course I loved it. ICODEF is the most prestigious conference in the world annually in the state of the Netherlands in which I had not once been invited. Bambleby went here pretty damn I’ll be working on a few research expeditions this year,” I said. “There is a particular sponsor that I wish to impress. Very deep pockets. This would mean funding for not one of the research expeditions I personally know. It could mean putting off a lot of resources. Few things would be more interesting on a paper than an abstract of a heretofore unknown Folk. As you say, these works are known to be widely accepted by even the most open-minded of scholars. As I’ve always argued, the fact that the Folk are absent in the Arctic regions of Arctic and sub-Arctic Europe cannot be described as evidence of their absence in this country.” I narrowed my eyes. “I’ve not been invited to ICODEF this year. Will you credit me in a footnote?” I asked. “I will present our findings together. I will impress my sponsor. You will make a name for yourself and set the scientific community clamouring for research, which I understand will continue to be next . My friend John sank back into his slouch, looking merry, utterly convinced that I would be delighted. I kept my expression bland, despite a lack of interest in him
