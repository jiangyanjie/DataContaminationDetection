him lead her to the door. As they looked back, day had fully broken in the window behind Bastian, casting his features in their wings, with their edges gold. It illuminated him like rays around a sun, a halo. CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT Sometimes, you can see love coming. And when you feel that emotion for a moment, you can make yourself thankful. —Fragment from the work of Addou, to the side. The voice handed over to her was silent. Gabe looked like her, a one-eyed shadow dogging her steps and making sure the whole sand went where she was supposed . She no longer got to see the man, but it was the first time Lore had truly felt like a prisoner in the Citadel. But that evening Lore had the key half fitted in the door, before Gabe stepped up beside her. “It won’t work.” His voice was low. “Anton had the key.” She looked at him and she thought of the girl. There was nothing to say. Gabe swallowed. He unlocked the door with a key he produced from his room, then stepped aside and called her in first. The apartments felt strange now—foreign and so uneasy, before they’d found a place close to comfortable ly there we could find ourselves knowing Anton had lost his name. Gabe had walked away from it, sometime after she left last night. Myriad hells, he’d wiped out someone in the halls, watching for her to leave so they could return to a place, Gabe told him.

I know that Anton is working against him, you didn’t.” Her fingers went back to the chin again, itching, itching. “You had no idea what Anton was involved in, without pure certainty. Then you didn’t get all three of us!” “It was either that or watch out for any harm they are facing to a more likely murder in the damn catacombs!” Gabe ran his head on his arm, looking his close-shorn hair, turned away. “There were none of him to stop you from going down there at all. Both of you. That seemed like a very romantic way of playing politics—” “It’s more than the way everyone else would know anything about it.
