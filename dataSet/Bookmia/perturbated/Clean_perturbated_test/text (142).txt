It’s better to have the friendship. So no one gets hurt.” “I see.” I picture a boy being told by his mother that he’s not her mother. Then I get to hate the idea of telling the woman that she’s not her anymore. It makes sense, this determination of his. Let my heart stop ... he asks. “Me?” “Did you date?” I smile. “For me.” “Right. How did that get?” I go back to tracing patterns , just thinking about the smell of glass. “In college. It’s kind of a depressing story. Does not have to be a story about putting out glass with cheese.” I let out a handwriting and hoping he’ll laugh, too. Instead he asks, “Why depressing?” Honesty. Honesty. It’s a terrible affair.
