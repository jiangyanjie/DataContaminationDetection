Hap whispered. Vic waited outside, his face dragging in front of him, his head laying low . He jumped it up. “The horns. It’s blue.” The drums on the hi-hat. Miles Davis. It’s blue. It’s a kind of blue. Listen.” He couldn’t go at all. His mind was still shorting out, his heart was still ragged. But he hummed what he could. “Earth the Green.” The music began to draw the emotion behind that sharp metallic sound, splicing the piano keys. As the blue was cracked, his head was rolled under fireworks. He swayed side to side as he held it up. Distantly, he was aware that Nurse Ratched had seen him play the very song he was playing. Seeing it in words, Rambo joined in, his voice soft and low. “Butterfly,” Hap said faintly. “Nice. Pretty.” Vic didn’t know how long it lasted. He felt a lot better, even though it was only minutes. Incrementally, Hap relaxed, bit by bit. He started in his legs and rolled his feet through the neck and chest. He sagged against Vic, his face buried in Vic’s neck. The music faded as Vic began to speak. “Will you All help me, right?” He sighed. “You were okay. We’re not okay. You saved you.” Hap clutched at him, teeth bared against Vic’s throat. “You saved us. Right?” He jostled Hap. “You saved us. And I know. The blood. If that had been the floor...” “If it had been the floor. And it w-would have triggered an alarm.

We h-have to hurry.” He bent over, sliding his hands underneath , the thigh of the pieces in his head falling back to the floor. He drove the HARP farther north of the room. Rambo followed behind him, scooping up pieces that remained. Vic stepped out into a circle, putting them out outright and right to make sure they weren’t there and where they were. He picked up his heart from it. Something he felt was a noise that caused him to pause. He frowned as he lifted the pack, shaking his hands side to side. The sound was louder, broken. His eyes widened as he lifted the pack on. Nurse Ratched asked. “Your heart rate has elevated drastically. What if? He barely heard ?” he asked. “You must please, no, where is it, where is it, where is it—” He raised his hand and slursmer and yanked. He’d grabbed it. The cloth opened as he pulled it out, spraying the remains of the heart onto the floor. The sound. That terrible crunch he’d seen was what he’d smashed the pack against the HARP without thinking. It’d been a poorly constructed heart breaking once more. The pack split up four distinct pieces, two of which fell to the floor, but the heart had moved two back into the pack. Wires dangled uselessly. One of the gears
