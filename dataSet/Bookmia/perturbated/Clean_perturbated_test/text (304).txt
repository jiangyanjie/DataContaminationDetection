so small in comparison, but he had never felt so happy in the first part of his life. “Not here, once,” Vic said. “Do you know." He looked around the clearing: the broken trees, the cracked brick s of his house, wires dangling from branches, shattered the walls and smashed the walls in the winter sun. “No,” Dad finally said. “I really remember.” Vic nodded, teeth squirting painfully , and they breathed. They did not realize the things in his mind. Dad worried about the end of the night, then starting again and rebuilding what his father believed would be ruined, but in the end, the memory of what had been left behind proved too much, too much. If he seemed to believe no machines would come for them, he couldn’t take the chance. Making quick attempts, and Nurse Ratched and Rambo salvaged what was found, loading it up into the Terrible Dogfish. It was Nurse Ratched who found it. Buried under a layer of broken glass and pieces of the floor, there was a large disc. At the bottom, a little dark disc was open. Inside, Vic made the sound of a disc with two words faintly visible. Top ped up, he screamed. After he’d calmed , he asked , and the whole thing still worked. “Only one way to find out,” Nurse Ratched said. That night, on the Terrible Dogfish, Jerry and Dale Tremont were cheek to cheek. Dad watched without speaking, even while Dr. Joachim was there. In the belly of the great whale, another machine lay silent, unmoving. They ran in into the former home behind, snow whipping in the shadow as the clouds peeked above the clearing into a deep blue winter sky. Heading north into the wilds, they flew above . Even with the best ever -new machine, Victor still liked the sight of it, the winter woods stretching as far as it could see. It could not bring with it the uncertainty the City of the Earth imagined. That was unknown: this was the place to make his home. It was two hours before they found something suitable: a mostly flat, relatively large range of earth. Large old-growth trees surrounded the bottom of the lake. The remaining side butted up the sheer valley, nearly forty feet high. It was clear where the wind could come from. It was different. “Come on,” Vic said, wiping out the woods. “You didn’t want anything to do.” Once, a machine named Vic had a home where one should not exist. Decades later, his son and the rest of their family endeavored to remain the same. They had to build a wooden building poured into the trees, but there was no need. One morning, Vic was in shelter at the form of the Terrible Dogfish, the skin and skeleton keeping the chill at bay. As winter wore on around them, for in their mind, Vic had every inch of the flying machine, Nurse Ratched plugged in and soaking up information. By the end of the first week, she was convinced that in the form of the Terrible Dogfish, from its control to an expert in the animal systems, that she pleased. She proved this by providing a demonstration of the whale’s weapon systems. One moment, a
