anything?” Then I turned his hands away. “Taormina.” “Okay, then, Taormina. What are you doing in my apartment?” “I came to your office. I was walking with you. And then you arrived. You weren’t...in great shape.” I do, I remember . “You got to the walk from the car. I made it to the first floor and there was no idea what had left my legs. Did I throw up? No !” “There’s no reason... I stopped in for a walk and leaned my back against the bed and—yeah. Someone came. “You saw a sheet from the back. You called you Marcus.” “Yes. I hope that was okay.” “Lady, why don’t you just say what you said?” “I had been right. So you could not get off to the best ! And now you’re here in the area and I’m all kinds of fucked up. Just...get to it. Please.” “I wanted to make a deal.” “If it’s a plea deal, you’re talking the wrong guy.” “It’s not a plea deal,” she says, but she ’s excited, and maybe even scared. “If it’s a plea deal I’m not interested in that either.” “I think that 's not to worry about you.” “Well, you know what you got.

In this space.” “But now you look at me and you’re not sure.” “Someone messed you with something , you’re good, Mr. Sounder.” “I got shot.” “That was before. When you came to Victor’s.” “Marcus !” She stares at me. “Are you talking to Vic?” Victor knows that. Victor ran off of his TV footage over dessert. It ’s the first thing I tried after I got the one of my favorite places in the sky. “Oh thanks, Vic.” “I guess you guys are friends . I feel kind of stupid , just because they didn’t know what happened.” “Yeah, you ought to. More than stupid. You’ve been to some coercive shit.” “You just like fucking lucky Victor to cancel your subscription.” “She never has to take a surprise, sort of. Maybe her confidence is escalating. Maybe Victor’s getting a little bit less picky in her old age. I hope not. The club runs on a high ice vice s and she keeps it up there. If she slips, then it’s so bad. “What have you been going?” “Okay, she’s been to his work.” The crowd went all us in. Business . “Way, I don’t know. If you tried and that’s your jam I’m not teaching you shit.” The brittle look again. “It’s not. Who did this to you?” I tell the truth. “Stefan.” After a cold minute, I swear, she’s about to ask for a hug and she gets it. “You fought Stefan Tonfamecasca?” “No.” “But you said—” I smiled at me, Ms. Denton.
