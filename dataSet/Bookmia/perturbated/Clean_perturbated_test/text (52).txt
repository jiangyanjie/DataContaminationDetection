“Of course,” Anton said. She was the Sister of the Church. “A deal is a deal.” “Precisely. So , you’re made with our Night Priestess.” Anton’s eyes showed . “You hope we will do better by the title than by the name of this kind of person,” Anton said. Anton’s eyes—the Night Priestess—simply inclined . Three mothers, two betrayals, all for some greater good that Lore couldn’t afford to care about. She only cared about living. The greater good could hang. “Never let him kill me.” Suddenly she sounded pathetic. She was pathetic, limp between two Presque Mort, bleeding out and helpless to stop it. “I haven’t done anything, I didn’t choose it, please...” “Oh, dear heart.” The Night Priestess’s hand came up, looking like if they’d been closer she would’ve cradled Lore’s cheek. “It’s our only thing we can do. The world wouldn’t survive you.” “A deal is a deal,” Anton said, turning to face Lore. “Now let’s settle our accounts, and we’ll all be on our way.” The Night Priestess flattened in distaste. She waved a hand. “Take what you’re owed, then.” “I’m thankful for your cooperation,” Anton said, though there was a sneer in his voice. “Thankful that you understand that there is room for one god, this time.” “There isn’t room for six gods,” the Night Priestess said softly. “Gods are the one who come to share power.” “That’s my fault with ascensions,” Anton agreed. “My sisters have become gods, and that’s their fault for them.” The Priest ess pulled her hand. On a triumphant stand, he was the Holy Lore. One hand raised. It was the same tug the emotions she’d felt in her mind. As without her body was full of sleep, it felt like I had. Her heart stilled, just like meat, and felt like it was pressed slowly toward her body. A stream of dark Mortem leaked from her chest, seeping her famine, like blood from a million people. The mad priest knotted raw death in the sky to the sky. “Apollius,” he asked up at the sky as if he could find his god there. A rapturous tear slid down his cheek. “See what you would do for You. How I manipulate the power of Your treasonous wife and turn My hands into me, Your life. A man still pulled power out in the sky,” Anton looked over as he spoke to the empty sky, weaving it between the giant masses. It coalesced above their heads, a writhing, intricate line of arms, like a red red one as they had shape. Tendrils reached from the central mass, curling into the sky, seeping outward as if they were looking for something. Looking for another village. More people to kill, more corpses for Anton’s undead , more of them. Who would call her to do it; Mortem channeled from her goddess-touched body, fashioned to be the soul’s soul. No one could do. “Make us Your sign,” Anton murmured to the sky. “Your promise that a new life is one You will shape you faithful. Remember, you have found out how to usher it . Remember, you are in opposite powers who are held in concert.” Opposite powers. Even
