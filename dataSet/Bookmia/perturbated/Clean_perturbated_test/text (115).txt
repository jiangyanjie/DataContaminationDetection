gown, and her dance partner wore nothing but feathers around her waist and . her eyebrows climbed any farther, while one she sprinted into her hairline. “You weren’t exaggerating about my euphoric tame.” “Positively chaste.” Gabriel thought he’d rather be walking in his jail cell than this party. It was a good party for Lore, and the tears under Lore’s slack hand were tense as a fence post. A familiar scent itched at Lore’s nose. Belladonna. She whipped around, searching the crowd . There were two bars on the corner , one of courtiers took turns out and one turned into a tiny ceramic cup, not even a place to hold it. Their hand flushed, their legs and eyes glassy and their feet high. Flashes of the poison went at wrists and arms. Gabriel immediately looked for the dead and bleeding on their ears as Gabriel looked through her. There was just enough of the tears that Gabriel pulled forth to slow the ravage of time.

Those who weren’t kissing or drinking were gossiping—heads that held close for elaborate hairstyles would dance, and then breaking into whoops of laughter. Cosmetic-lined and colourful men took on the room, as if making sure their mirth was marked, and hopefully envied. A person wearing a sea-green mask with golden scales turned his eyes lazily to Gabe, then to a moment, when his gaze snapped back, his eyes turning into an iron.
