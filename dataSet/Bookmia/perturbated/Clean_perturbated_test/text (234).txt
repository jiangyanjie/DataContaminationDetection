a wink,” she said. “It’s far too hot.” She pointed at Winnie. “You’re somebody who needs her beauty , who won’t rise to that, Winnie thought. “Remember, Hephzibah, you’ve got to go back to work early, to keep an eye on the arrivals and keep Miss de Vries moving.” “Shall I be given supper?” Winnie said. “If you make enough of a fuss, I suppose. Introduce her to Mrs. Bone’s men, make sure Miss de Vries thinks they’re a policemen, and then get to work upstairs.” Hephzibah frowned. “Do this thing go any faster, girls?” The Janes thumped in and the boat ers churning the water. Winnie could see other boaters looking around in displeasure, rocking on the waves. The motion slowed and her head looked as clean as could be. She pulled her arm. “You’re really making the head up,” Alice said. “I’m in a challenge to sew Miss de Vries into her costume. But I spend time about it. You ’re strained, harassed, and running late.” Alice looked troubled, running her hand through the murky breeze. Alice didn’t want her to be glaring. Mrs. King smiled in the distance. “You’ll be a little girl.” And that was all. How did she do it? Winnie wondered. How did you be so smooth, she thought?

Unless you’re going to gag Madam with chloroform and give her up or sell her to be charged for ransom, that won’t work. She’ll catch us, she’ll see everything, you’re trying to know exactly what’s going on.” Winnie studied Alice with concern. The girl had gone pink in the cheeks, speaking so boldly.
