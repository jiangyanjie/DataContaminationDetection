tomorrow. Then all that’ll be left is locking everything up and closing the doors to control the divider pitches in. We get it done and get home. ”It’s like home,” says Kyle. “I’m ready to whip up outta here.” “Same,” says Kyle. “Let we go.” CHAPTER 7 We spend the morning cleaning cabins—stripping the curtains, wrapping blankets and stuffing them into watertight storage bags, making sure all the windows are closed and locked out. Once I shut off the cabin, I transfer the electricity to the whole place , so it is saved for last. I asked coach and Bezi to pull them out of the lake ; I swam them against the side of the lake. I can’t help but think that the snow is just the way we saw by the lakeside, but the sooner we get everything done the sooner we can leave. Porter helps Kyle take some extra trash; Tasha and Paige cover the firepit s to get it out from our stripped-down cabins. Javier helps us bring all our personal belongings into our cosy Lodge. Coach and Bezi sweep through the storage shed when Javier waltzes past his armful of pillow-top pillows. “What about the fire pit?” he asks.

It pops on and the smell knocks me back immediately. I quickly cover my nose and mouth with a shirt and look at it. Bezi asks. “Oh my god, what is that ?” Bezi asks, her eyes watery. I hold the shirt up over the counter and scan the room. Sitting on the wooden table in the center of the room is a plate of chicken breast, broccoli, and broccoli. I try to remember when we had that last week so I ’ve had my broccoli tasting like garbage so I dumped mine. It had to have been this past Thursday, which also happened to be the last time the staff were on the night and were accounted for. The bed was rotted and crawling with gnats .
