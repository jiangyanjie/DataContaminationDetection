and acknowledged that his father was in fact proud of his son’s skill in the kitchen, perhaps even in the kitchen as a degradation of his manhood. Finn seemed kindhearted at his core, and he said with some formality, “I hope you enjoy . If you need anything else, you can send word to the person you know. How could you order a seven suit for breakfast?” “Yes,” I said, regretting the change from his own conversation. “Thank you, and this arrived only yesterday! ,” Finn said, withdrawing an empty pouch from his pocket. “We get mail deliveries ”, and with the way he said it, he saw this as a source of happiness, and I forced a smile as Finn came to him. He smiled back and departed, noticing the change about the chickens. I looked at the letter, and a few days later, confronted with a letter that read The Kitchen. Boody Bambleby, in the upper left corner, and in the lower right corner. It was to the home of Sarah Wilde, Abode of Krystjan Egilson, Farmer, Village Manager, Ljosland. “Bloody Bambleby,” I said.

These are largely because of the humble downy birch, and only a few rowans and shrub willows. Nothing grows to a great height in a cold place, and there are some birds that I could see were stunted, tucking themselves ominously into the hills of the mountainside. Their creations are mesmerizing. The Folk s are embedded in their environments[*3] as the grass in these forest have climbed into the hills; to meet the creatures who called such an inhospitable place home. Bambleby’s letter sat upon the table, somehow conspiring to give off a kind of negligent ease, and so finally, once I finished the bread (good, not tasting of smoke) as well as the wine (also good, also good, not tasting of smoke), I took it up and slid my hand in the mouth. So dear Emily, it began. I can remember how you’re settled comfortably . You’ll get the snowbound fastness, and that sounds merry as you pore over your throat and collect a
