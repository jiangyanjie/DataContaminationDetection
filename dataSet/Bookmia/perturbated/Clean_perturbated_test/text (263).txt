going to do this, I need to show that we both know what to expect. Considering that we haven’t had all of this up front. “The book has a lot to do, first, though. I’m sure we’ll do this before then, but when the trip is over, we are, too. We go our separate ways and never tell anyone.” I grab my fork through the extra peanut sauce. “Protection is nonnegotiable. And consent, obviously.” “No one wants to call me there.” “If one of us ever wants to call the whole thing off, for any reason, they would then continue. No one else was not going to be there. “We would do so every night. And it’s probably better , but it doesn’t, since the book needs to be our top priority. If one of us doesn’t want to do it—they don’t have to defend it —they should use excuses.” “Frankly, I’m not sure I need to perform every single night,” he adds. “And that’s a relief.” Then he adds: “We should be able to feel like we just say something.

There would just be ‘a few pointers,’ but I thought it might have been easier, and we’re doing it,” I thought. I’m hoping the book looks better for the memoir, so . . I guess Finn grins at this. “That’s kind of amazing. I’m kind of impressed with having somebody swipe around on my phone before passing it over.” “It’s not in the way. We may just try to adjust it based on whatever you want to do, or whatever we feel like needs more , and that all makes perfect logical sense—at least, I think so.
