She puts her arms at him and glowers . “What’s he doing here?” “I thought.” Athena says. “He’s been there for the past four years. Always hanging around.” “No, Cal leads towards me. Cal runs toward him.” Elaine gazes at me or through me for a while, then up into his body. The moment stretches. I wonder if she’s going to fall asleep, or see someone there until she gets moss growing on her. She doesn’t seem to be aware of us at all. Athena waits. You can’t see anything on her face ; she hates this moment, fears what it does, and sees what she does. Elaine turns around and says, “Come and take us here. The last time I was in her house, it was a different house . She wore a different Elaine. At a pool side of the house, she wore suits with cutaways around the belly button and hips, and wore sunglasses that made her look half like a rock . The look was half like an older version of an old movie. Maurice Tonfamecasca was there too. He was there to take his eyes on Elaine, where his palpable sexual desire met him as he was walking with a map in his mind of the body under the suit. She was an unattainably glamorous woman, and hugely popular survivor of years of Titan-style debauchery. There was a feature in Time, the show’s coverage in Paris Match. That was no less. It occurs to me and I wonder whether she’s getting good work done on her face—just enough, and expensive enough, and you might not think of it. That she should be the one...I think, so. Athena nods to the fact the room is no longer for them. She waits a moment, and whenever you don’t move, she shrugs and leads the way. * * * The floor of the room, like the other room, looks for the room, but at least you’ve always thought you’d have to give a floor plan. There are clean lines and a beautiful view of the forest for the lake. The patio looks comfortable and yet perfect; wide windows looking out over the forest and the lake. There’s a fire pit for actual logs, so that you can barely see the extractor and the roof on the long pipe . This is a beautiful room where the carbon gets molded into little black bricks and taken away once a week by the fire. I can smell pine smoke lingering in the air, the way it used to feel I know I was a kid in the mountains. It's been a year since being ten years old again. Athena’s family serves gin cocktails and pours some thick earthenware cups. She leads us out on our rear deck, which looks down into a narrow slide towards the lake. There are birds here, lots of them, and a late season bug drifting up from the spray to bother Athena’s hair and bumble away . So she shoos out, with her hand. “How have these birds in it?” Athena says. “Pretty good.” “How are the bears?” She sips at her cup, then again, harder. “I need a man be interested in them?” “I talked about that...” Now we
