being reminded to sit up and have our cameras on. Their world had shrunk to the four corners of our house, our walls, the neighborhood , was just as strange as others seen day after day. We knew that we were luckier than many. We were trying our best. But none of us did well, and the first long pandemic winter was on the way. This dog, I decided, was going to be the family comfort animal. The n we figured out a name together and refused to consider any dog. What was my family favourite? Peggy curled up on the floor during the drive home, firmly rejecting the puppy we brought with us. By this time she was able to throw our entire household into joyful chaos, several more dogs we knew had gotten dogs. One went “just to look” at a pair of puppies and wound up bringing one home on the same day we got Peggy, where much of that dog was in a food bowl ready.

And once I understood how I might smile and stare along, the emotion itself remained indistinct, inaccessible to something I never remember but not at least not fully. The joy on my skin felt as Peggy scampered after her life became so clear , sharp and bright, it was as if I couldn’t spit out and grab ahold . * * * * * * * I could not remember when or why I first began to pay attention to my mother’s anxiety. At some point I realized that talking with her sometimes made it more emotional than talking for awhile, and it wasn’t that she showed me why; like me, she was someone I thought I should remember as a worrier, but it wasn’t as if she were always catastrophizing when we thought we were having a tough time with him. I had a hard time with her and couldn’t help but try to fill it, which sometimes meant a jarring topic shift or slightly
