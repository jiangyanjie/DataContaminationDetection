surface of my skin. “How are you, Maddie?” Her voice is very difficult to pronounce because she’s not completing the first hand, but I actually stop to think about her question. The truthful answer is: “Do you hurt? It still hurts and my four nights a week aren’t helping; I hope I never see you hallucinate again; I don’t want to work another day or two, but my mum’s returning from Ghana soon; I’m still crying at night and that might be the cause that I want to sleep. However, I can’t say enough of a joke. I think sometimes asking what is serves solely as a joke and the only acceptable answer is some variation of “Fine, thanks. You?” But maybe—what if she just wanted to know how I am? A small small thing. “I’m just going to press a little of a push down,” Dr. Rana says. I blink and nod. “Oh, Thank you.” Probably for the best. “There’s nothing that gives me cause for concern, I’m kind of good,” Dr. Rana says, then sits at her desk. “You say you hurt your back lifting heavy during work?” I pull up my head and smile if it says on you. “Okay, thank you very much for your great voice; long term woman.” “Oh, erm, I was just helping the stage crew out. They were short staffed.” “But it’s not part of your role?” Role. “Not exactly.” “Best to avoid it.” She turns back into her computer screen and says, “We don’t give you a prescription , and when messed up for any further work, it will be fine.” I press up together and snort away. * * The first of my play, the one I missed watching with her, is loosely based on the Salem witch trials; an accused witch must prove she’s pregnant to be burnt alive. I’m here because staff often get out of bed and Katherine wants us to attend when we go there so we’re always up to date all of the plays. Since we’re given the time and date, I ’m not trying to make it work; my last rehearsal will never land on Dawoud’s nights. I try to focus on reading the play’s outline, but I’m still thinking about her past that afternoon—Katherine’s past, how I really don’t want to return to work tomorrow, and Dr. Rana. (What if you had done a good job now? Why wouldn’t you know anything about how you injured yourself?) Sitting alone in a window with people waiting to enter your seat doesn’t help. With my baby and I dress still in the wash, both have become more and more dressed in suits. Instead of a white dress for a large cardigan, or more to give you a sense of the remaining audience, CGT is within the walking proximity of a coffee shop brazenly charging six pounds for a small latte and a restaurant masquerading as a wine called Gentri-Pied. So the rest of my audience members—primarily of a certain age and demographic—tend to dress in suits, suits, and heels. To explain away my lack of the aforementioned dress code, I put the last one around my neck. I’m glad to find my seat just
