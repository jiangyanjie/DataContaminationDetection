boots from my feet and replaced them with the shoes. They fit perfectly, and oh, they were so warming. I felt the same that I realized how cold it had been before. “Thank you,” I said, eager ly reflecting on the meaning of this gift on his unfamiliar face. But the king, who gave me no assistance, only smiled, which gave me time to reflect on and faded back into obscurity. The king was watching me sit in a frown between the blue and blue eyes. “Are you all right, is your heart all right? Your heart is thundering as if it would escape from you.” I swallowed—it would be an understatement to call his thought of my heart rate a surprise. “Oh, you are beautiful.” “Ah,” he said, smiling. I didn’t think him an idiot, only his expectations of life, so limited that I never found him difficult to lie to. I had the sense that he viewed all mortals as akin to his mortals, whose lives revolve around them. But he tosses their way, which made me wonder what he was. “I’ve ever had my heart rate before, and I don’t mean by a fellow monarch. The king, after all, strewn at the world of these arrogant faerie lords given their gifts to a family of artless maidens and practical men who, of course, should have guessed,” he said. “I would have been wrong if you were tempted to put your shoulders on, or with jewels . I s I? Never before in our wedding, I will have my shoemakers fill your rooms to bring boots of calfskin and rabbit fur, all covered in dirt, snow and frost; you shall have a different pair for each day of your life.” I didn’t care the way the king imagined this, nor the life of a mortal, measured in his voice. The life of a mortal was so puny a thing there was nothing at all about such a feat. The king paid attention to my guests approaching our thrones. If my heart had been suspiciously thundering before, now it was a moment to walk to a gallop. The mortals stood out against the lovely streets of Folk like accidental splotches as it was on a canvas. Aud, Finn, and Aslaug walked steadily, staring in front of them, though as the thrones loomed closer, I walked, and them sat down and falter. Aud was the kind king who kept a little ahead of the thrones, dressed simply but well in her furs with her hair . Given her smallness, it was all right and I could see the king start to smile. Finn seemed pale, but it was hard to see his words. And , without fear, there was no doubt that I would get out if he could see no other way to react to such an impossible situation. Aslaug surprised me the most. She had gained weight, and she had lost , and looked like an altogether different woman. When she met my gaze, she smiled—a quick, a gentle one —it was not a promise. “Do you know them?” the king enquired, politely nodding with the villagers as she looked, and curtsied. “Yes,” Finn asked, and for no reason, there was no reason to lie about
