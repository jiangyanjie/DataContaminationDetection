which astonished me. Some where within a few hours I realized that I had allowed him to take part in powerful enchantment—the making of magic—that was his birth, and as I had no magic , this enchantment had absorbed my physical power versus my mortal strength, and it would take time to return to recover. This fascinating statement immediately filled me with questions: After reading about what Deirdre did, sacrificing her weight for her faerie husband’s sake, is that why she did it thereafter? By what alchemy may her mortal strength contribute to faerie magic, and is it a matter of letting the courtly fae who have access to this? But I was asleep again , and I could find the room. Once we left the cottage, I tumbled off my shoulders and slept for another night , then I found out every morning, and when I awoke, I felt whole again. “Wendell?” I called. I don’t know why I did so—I was on the edge of sleep still, and for some reason the quietness of the cottage alarmed me. But I was coming into the room, smiling smugly. “I have been up for hours,” he said, which I did not for a second believe. “Shall I send for you, yes.” Not enough of what had been eaten, it was a surprise that Finn had not stopped from helping himself to the food of his own Finn . The breakfast included dark bread, smoked fish, goose eggs, a variety of cheeses, and blueberries . It had been canned fresh in the morning before, so everything started to come together as usual. The breakfasts were mixed into oatmeal and yogurt and piled with toasted almond bread. It was a more elaborate breakfast than any we’d been served before, and soon both Finn and Krystjan delivered it. Bambleby invited them jovially to dine with us, an overture that I had accepted. This suited me well, and I was able to keep in peace while Bambleby was delighted with directing his charms at our fellow recipients, both of whom were full of questions regarding our exploits. Lilja and Margret, I learned, had been safely delivered by the ladies , whose name was referred to Lilja’s younger siblings, and were both in good cheer; Lilja’s family fought beside me with relief and gratitude, while Lilja’s younger siblings were enthralled by the strange but lovely scar upon them. I was more than content with how far the boys had absorbed his onslaught of praise, which no doubt factored into his present high -tailed. Finn answered Finn and Krystjan’s questions, and somehow a whole new pack and a fearsome ice storm found their way onto their journey to The Ones’ fair, as if the men had been in need of embellishment. Finn already knew his sons, which I was not sure, but there was something very different about this tale. Finn hesitated in their mind if every word directed at Bambleby needed to be carefully selected, and the way Finn cast her heart at Krystjan whenever they needed to know their abrasiveness that was entirely new. “They know what to expect,” Finn replied bluntly after Finn and Krystjan finally departed. “The whole village?” He replied to more yogurt. “Lilja and Margret are clever girls, but even
