a decommissioned canoe has a box with its name that is on and about the hatch. Javier lets Kyle hiss out from her teeth. “That explains that,” Javier says. “We were running on the canoe. Nice.” “And the camera?” I ask. “And the lock of the boathouse? I know I locked it.” As the head looks sharp, Kyle asks. “I forgot to unlock the front gate. It’s okay if it slipped in my seat.” “No,” I say adamantly. “I don’t forget to do stuff like that.” Kyle’s gaze traces back to the floor. “Sorry,” I say. “I do not tryna make you feel bad. I’m so sure that I know why I use it.” Bezi tries to get Tasha on the phone, but she doesn’t have a reason. “We take you to the office, use the landline,” I say. Javier’s brows down to the floor, I say. “Who is ‘we’? I’m not going anywhere.” “I had six,” I say. “You’re not worried about them?” “Not really,” says Javier. “They’re probably on their way back right now.” Bezi crosses her arms over her knees. “I guess Tasha has a soft spot for insensitive jerks.

I’m going to take a flashlight and go on my phones. “I’m coming too,” Bezi a wrangles. Javier sighs. “I guess I’m going too.” Javier glares at us. “You’re just gonna leave me here? Alone?” “Yeah,” I say without hesitation. He grumbles . “I can’t call you!” Javier then tilts his head and clenches . “Fine. We’ll all go together.” Suddenly, my phone vibrates on my pocket, and I let out a noise as I do . A signal trigger. I breathe my kind of relief as the signal flashes across the screen. I hit the green button and hold it to my ear. “Tasha! Oh my ... You are gonna have been tryna call you, but the signal—” Static garbles the line, and my voice breaks through in strangled lines. “I’m . . . there! I can’t . . . please!” Bezi a screams on my arm. “Where is she? What’s happening?” A fear unlike anything I’ve ever felt in my entire three years of working at Camp Mirror Lake, or my lifetime of watching, grips my voice as I smirk a vise, squeezing
