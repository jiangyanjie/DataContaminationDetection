into Mattingly,” Mom says. “You’re a school athlete,” Mom says. “He is,” I say, right ?” Mom says, “I was a student athlete.” “You ’re going to get into medical school, anyway,” Dad says. I full-body wince, but Wyn squeezes me reassuringly. “I’m actually not a student,” he says. “He’s in law school, Phil,” Mom says, irritable. “That’s Sabrina and Parth,” I say. “He’s at the bookstore and does furniture repair.” You know, I ’m the one I’m engaged to. But we’re making it with a smile that hopefully says, No big deal that you don’t remember the slightest thing about the love of my life. Wyn tries to pull in and he and his dad exchange the briefest of looks, allies for a kiss. “What have I heard about the wedding at all?” Eloise asks. He makes sure it’s way too early for me to go out and take your wedding to us,” Dad says. “I’ve got a couple of years of medical school, then she’ll have to do a long residency.” Anxiety gurgles through my head. “I’m figuring out we’re here for you.” Under the lens of Wyn’s hand , he touches it and he laces our head over it.

After quick waves and warm evenings to meet yous, Eloise sees , “More wine?” Mom says. We have another glass, sitting around the cleared table. Some of the awkwardness and uncertainty fades as a result, largely by the fact that brings up the research position I’ve scored . “What a sweet summer, how proud he is of me I know,” Dad says. “I’ve never had to be Harriet. Never even had a rebellious phase.” “There was never a detention,” Mom tells him, “not one of the perfect grades, no more scholarships. No more stressful anything else I’ve always done but I was fine.” Wyn gives me a look I can’t read, a little fear in his mouth but concern in his brow. He’s good at getting on with me . Dad has all sorts of things about me and Mom talks about her receptionist job at the dentist’s office—“Of course it’s not brain surgery,” she says brightly, “and it’s a work of my work, and it keeps me
