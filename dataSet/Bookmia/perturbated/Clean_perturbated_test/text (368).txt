going down the road,” I say. “The car won’t work .” Javier, with a deep, wavering breath and looks up at the sky. She seems to be out of the next place and grasp her hand. “Tasha is out there.” I try to push on the gate. And her terrified screams and thoughts of what might happen to her to sound that way. “We stay together. We do a round trip.” No side trips. We go to the gate before we know Tasha was headed; then we ’ll decide what to do from the gate,” Bezi, Javier and even Javier nod. The path that twists around behind the shed isn’t maintained as well as the other paths that snake through Camp Mirror and camp Mirror. The gates are overgrown with gravel, and the gravel is heaped in the middle of the gate. We mentioned that it used to pass all the way to the back and behind, but that access was abandoned for the main entrance years ago. The trail moves in on us from the side of the gate, and the darkness descends like a shade being drawn from the sky. Kyle clicks through the fence as I hover a battery on mine, figuring we’ll be on the way to walk back. The trail continues through the building, and while a tall gate bars our path, I can see that it continues into a thickly wooded area. A rusted chain is looped through the entire lot, so it’s almost like a large, equally rusted padlock. I yank on it, but no traces of orange in one way. “Look off on my fingers,” Javier says. “A little tetanus makes a great way to meet a shotgun-wielding recluse. This was such a good idea, Charity.” I ignore the push on the gate. Our trail is loosely securing the entrance, and by pushing onto the gate you get out of the loop; a gap opens, and we slip through. “Come on,” I say, gesturing for Bezi , Javier and Javier . No one squeezes in and pop a side into the other side, then holds the gate open so I can slip through after her. We pry the gate apart for Javier and for Kyle, so when we’re at the gate I survey the path ahead. The journey is almost complete now, and long shadows lean towards the uneven pathway. Snaps and clicks over the surrounding forest. The feeling of fear , fear and deepening shadows stokes a sense of panic in me. I feel like I can’t quite catch my heart. And then I let my heart slow down. Now I’ll just beat back the air over and over again as we push forward. “This was such a bad idea,” Javier whines as the air is slipping back on the surface of my heel. A light roaring out of the air is on him. “I just said we were gonna see this, but damn. Can you watch my foot?” he says, he hears as Kyle’s voice cracking. “There are bears and shit out here, Charity. You think about what I was talking about?” I don’t answer him. All I want to do is find Tasha, and if I didn’t look too long about what was making her
