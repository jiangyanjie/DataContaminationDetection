one?” “Nante yiye.” “Hey now.” “The address. What’s the address?” “Kyerɛ me kwan no.” Twi and English are flying in the air. Heels on pavement, engines pushing up, planes slamming. For a moment, I was alone because if I was here, his would be the car I’d sit for on. For years, wherever he went, by bus or by train, to the supermarket or the GP, I’d just ignored him, until I had to begin going instead of him. Dad gently pulls on my arm and tells me to get there in parking . The man at the wheel is admitted to a group at the church, but I don’t know his name. He’s a friend in the family, a family friend, or someone not blood-related, but it doesn’t matter. We pull back to the house and ride the road. We’re going to the funeral car behind the procession. Every time the hearse turns a clock I see the photograph of a young man who, having been framed, sat at the end of his coffin, the tears resurface. People on the street turn to watch us. A person. One old man is a sign of the cross. When their friend is mine, my father becomes very vulnerable and I feel exposed. I feel like I don’t want to stare at a funeral procession if my father passes . * * * * * I’ve never seen this graveyard before; I was afraid to avoid cemeteries because I worried it would tempt fate. Looks like fate found me anyway. The sun is hot and the ground is uneven. I like the cotton , but that’s too heavy . I have never watch the cemetery , or my dad ’s burial plot. They talk amongst themselves as they work because this is their own personal activity and there was “just another day at the office.” People I didn’t greet at the house come up to me, but I didn’t know who we are, and I didn’t really see any of them. Hello, Uncle. How are you ? Me ho yε. You are my screamer, Medaase. You’re so big now. Where do you remember me? Atop we’re all stood surrounding a rectangle of hollowed-out earth. And at the dand of my sister Mary is adjusting her headpiece and my uncle Osei swats at a fly. James is staring at the ground, Mum is pinching the ball out of the horse, Auntie Mabel has been bowed and Uncle Freddie dabs his eyes with a white handkerchief. Suddenly I hear the noise from before: the movement, the cars, the movement. “Are we all here?” Mum’s pastor s already lean ing at the tree where we must take to avoid the blatant swooping branches. “Yes,” Mum says. “Then let us pray. Lord God, we know you will take this day to our hands,” Mum says. “We are gathered here to celebrate the life of Mr. George Wright...” He finishes by telling us that Dad is in this place and that we can’t mourn for others. We need not mourn, but give thanks to God that we have a place where we can meet with loved ones
