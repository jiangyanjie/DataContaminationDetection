frantically as she practically jumps down and down in relief. “Hello? We need help! We’re at Mirror Lake. The camp? No,” Kyle pauses as her brows push together. “What? Hello? No. Mirror Lake. The camp! Please!” She holds the phone away from her face, and pounces upon her eyes. “The call dropped.” “Do you think they heard anything you said?” Kyle asks. “Why? When did they call?" “I—I ,” Bezi says. “Go onto the recliner with his head in his pocket, you’ll know what is going to be happening.” Kyle stumbles back towards the back door, slipping on his coat. “I’m going to start calling the office . I’ll call an ambulance from the landline.” Kyle looks up. “We’ll bring that to her , I’m going out there, for that reason. “You just go for a fuckin’ stroll?” “What else are we supposed to call?” Kyle asks angrily. “Just let her die?” Kyle asks in his head. “No. But—” “But nothing,” Javier says. “I’d go look for Bezi’s keys, but I feel like I’d be wasting time.

A few of the three flashes come from the window and see the light of a blaze, just feeling full relief. “He’s in,” I say. “He’s safe.” Bezi and I rush to the side as Bezi is at the center of her hand. Tasha groans, she rests and she gets her hands open and close into fists. “I think it hurts,” Bezi says. “Try not to move too much.” I grab a stack of hand towels from the kitchen and leave a picture of myself on the back of the couch. I gently lift the blanket covering Tasha’s belly. A terrible sinking feeling settles over me as I get a good look at the wound. I make my face a mask, but inside I try to scream.
