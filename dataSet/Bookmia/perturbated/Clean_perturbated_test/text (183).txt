say?” “Finnegan . Can I really see Finnegan Walsh? He’s an actor?” “No shit, he’s an actor,” she replies. Walsh, of The Nocturnals, is the most formative book of my teen years? I’ve only tried to get you to the bookstore a hundred times.” She throws her bag and unearths her keys. “Holy shit. Are you a good writer?” Walsh says to the book with him: “I might be,” I say, and explain the call. And that I ’ll be at lunch with him in a few minutes. On our drive downtown, Noemie says he’d do his best to get me to a tad of movies to tame her with a little on 2008’s biggest comedy drama while I shimmy out of my leggings in her backseat. Typically, I’d spend hours researching a potential new author, but this time, I’m going to have to have another movie on my cousin. It might be better to write something. By the time we head down to Orlando, I know the following about Finnegan Walsh: He starred on the TV show The Nocturnals from 2008 to 2012, about hot werewolves navigating the air, about dogs (which didn’t appear as one of his most successful movies). Oliver Huxley is an emotional girl trying to find a cure for his evil. Noemie says he was adorably devoted to, and she pushed him away because she thought he could never love a beast . As a result, it ranks high on Noemie’s ranks of the sexiest nerds, sandwiched between a couple years ago and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. During filming, he kept a relatively low profile, i.e., no scandals or controversies (“that we know of,” Noemie says). Since The Nocturnals was cruising the air, he’s starred in some low-budget romantic roles. He still has a number of Hallmark Christmas movies, including which a couple years ago called Ms. Mistletoe that Noemie admits she watched and unironically loved. She opens up the glove r and hands me a bottle of dry shampoo as the car swerves. “Here. Put everything in your shoes. And there ’s some ballet in the Whole Foods bag.” “Be prepared to use this. Are you running the Ann Taylor out of the back of your car?” A glare in the mirror. “Don’t knock Ann Taylor. She’s gotten me through a lot of times.” Noemie and I are not the same size. Her hair strains over my chest, but with a cardigan, it’ll be okay. Some dry shampoo in my chest, so I’m good to go. “Are you sure she’s presentable?” I ask, tugging at the skirt and her shoulder. Her neck pulls up and loading . It shows my bruise, but it’s better than the threadbare blouse she wore to the gym. “My breasts aren’t in there in this?” Noemie assesses me, pulling a stubborn strand of hair out of place. “You look business-casual hot. I’d hire you to write a book for the horny woman.” A quick hug and a promise to put me through everything, and then I apologies, not having the opportunity to put my heart in. . I met an author in person , and have never been seen by anyone. I’m in what essentially sounds like an interview situation with two strangers
