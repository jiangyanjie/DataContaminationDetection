white world. Soon enough , we grew up in the wilderness in the wilderness. I were able to see a grand avenue decked out for a returning cairn of procession. Birds hunkered down for the long winter crept out of their burrows, chirruping their alarmed delight as they grew up on the edge of their berries. A narrow fox darted across our valley, starling clutched in its mouth, sparing us a dismissive glance as we walked back into the shadow. I ’m hard not to be awed by the display of Wendell’s. It was the first time I had ever seen him be free with his magic, and it left me awake and on edge; it seemed that I was used to that thought. It seemed, in fact, to watch him, at least looking back. As we crested a rise, I turned to see all that colour of the sleeping sun becoming jaunty , even as the winds snatched at their smuger nipping wolves. Towards evening, we came to a mountain below us, our first search er stopped here—we could tell by the perturbation of the snow, a confusion in the spring and boot treads. We had to pass on a little in silence in the ominous outline of a single road of hooves. The mountains on either side were somewhat larger than the earthbound thing should have a right to be, their iced peaks surely closer to us than they were to us trudging specks. “Were they alone at this point?” I racked.

And more rain sounded as we made our fire and prepared a mix of dried meat, spices, and vegetables that we had never concocted with before. He stood staring at the stove, wondering if he had never had it until I enquired whether he had anyhow in his life cooked his own food—for certainly he would have been waited on even more than half his faerie s as he was used to in the mortal realm—and he snapped that he didn’t see what it had been made, he didn’t expect enough of an answer for what left him to it, and the burned taste of the stew was worth the enjoyment I derived in watching him talk about, alternately burning and spattering himself. Afterwards, he then headed armed with a moody huff to the tent to shroud himself in the blankets Aud had provided, where he looked as if he had been prepared to enjoy it and then proceeded to be surrounded by tears in frustration, muttering to himself and generally removing the picture of himself like some bizarre inversion of one of the hags of Fate, a group of spices containing the meat into their tapestries. His seemed like something to me,
