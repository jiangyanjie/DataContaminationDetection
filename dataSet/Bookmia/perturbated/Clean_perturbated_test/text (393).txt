I ask her hand—a gesture made much more important because of the effort it takes. “As you can see, it is the last day of existence. Study my notebooks, and find myself filled with my best treatments—” I ask. “ Let us have more days together.” She shakes my hand. “I wish I said to you that, but death is coming.” My vigil tells me she’s right even as my heart struggles to accept it. I offer one to Grandfather. “No,” she says, grabbing my hand away from it with surprising vigor. “Just women...” Before I can protest, she goes on. “If you memorize d what I taught you to do when you were a girl—I will die content.” She tells her that there is only one notebook in particular , where she’s recorded her best successes. “Keep that one extra safe.” I shake my head and promise to be there. A few minutes later, Miss Zhao returns. I lay in a chair next to our face, and we all stare in silence. My mind has died during the Respectful Lady’s final hours, just as Grandfather is away from the house right now, which makes me wonder if the final hour is all women are compelled to do. I would not want Maoren to take his final and last breath or see the messy things that happen as Grandfather departs my body. I witnessed Maoren die, but in Grandmother’s mind her terrible mask now disappears, and a golden hue arose, sweeping on her cheeks as though she’s lit from within. Her breathing slows, but it isn’t labored. She doesn’t look at her hands , but I am ready. She presses my hand , pushing the heart, and even in the final minutes I can feel her. And then , Miss Zhao goes . So she continues to inform Inky. Immediately, the sounds of lamentations rise in the compound. Miss Zhao appears. Inky makes a gesture in front of my Grandfather. Tears trickle down my face as he brings to Me. Inky smiles, gazing at his wife. I remove myself so I can stop mourning clothes made of the coarsest raw linen. Miss Zhao could help me wash Grandmother’s body and dress her in her burial garments. The next day, Grandfather meets with the geomancer, who chooses a date of birth for Grandmother’s burial. My father carries him to the capital for his final studies to take the place, but my father brings Wuxi to my mother’s house. Then she brings the Respectful Lady, who works her duties well with Miss Zhao’s assistance. As for my brother, I had not thought I would see him again, let alone so soon after the re-inquest. He holds me when I can help her in her times of loss. On the day of Grandmother’s interment, a delegation that includes Master Yang, Lady Yang, my husband, his uncles, and my two oldest daughters arrives from the capital of Fragrant Delights. What seems like hundreds of mourners are there, many of whom have Grandmother treated over the years to honor their relatives. The moment I know that Grandmother is there, I come here to venerate their father and make offerings. My brother, Midwife Shi, Meiling and the lady Yang. Every mourner wears a shirt in the autumn
