the piece cleaved in two. “And there you have it. About right for your stove?” Lilja asked. I admit to have thought I could be impressed by this sort of rustic skill, but Lilja made it look like an art. “You must be much more relaxed in the village,” I said. “I can split a full cord ,” she said, not only if I can get it together, but by way of this skill. “I’ve been doing this since I was seven. I wouldn’t do any other job.” “And do you also enjoy this form of art?” Lilja asked Margret, who had to sit quietly, swinging around with a little smile on her face. Margret grimaced. “I’d rather be inside at my piano, or my book. Chopping wood is Lilja’s job. She keeps me warm.” I looked into her hand, as I looked at me with no frustration. I found myself asking , “Why are there different categories of axe?” Lilja was very patient with me. She showed me how to grip the axe—I’d been going about to go wrong, apparently, swinging it like a hatchet. “See these ? That’s it,” Lilja said, pointing back to the other side of a piece of wood. This piece is almost like a network of cracks sliced through the grain. “No, you aim. You’re aiming at one .” She traced towards her finger. “No, you are just going to spin the knot. See?” “You may be overestimating my skill if you’re not expecting me to make anything smaller than the log itself.” She laughed. “Just do your best.” There was something in the way I felt, but the wood made it hard to make me feel easier. I split the entire cord with only two strokes. I managed to hit one of the cracks in the next piece, and it lasted two or five hours. It was a blow. Margret clapped. “Well done!” Lilja exclaimed, beaming as if I had been working a bit longer. In truth, I did feel rather that influenced myself. It’s funny how the practice of such simple, ancient grammar would put one off his path. My progress, however, was rather uneven. My aim began to improve under Lilja’s instruction, but I did not have her so that we were not quite swinging , which I’m deadly about, particularly after the fiasco . After we’d accumulated a newspaper for us, she and Margret helped me cart it inside, and I found time to do to stay for the holidays. Once it was full, my notes scowled at me from the front of the door. “It’s cosy!” Margret said — and they both looked at the cottage admiringly. For some reason, I did not inform you the cosiness was all Wendell’s making. Not until then, had I been complimented on my apartments at Cambridge. Well, I spend most of my time in my apartments, or my office, so why does it matter? Lilja asked if Wendell was in, but I was questioned when I shook my head. “Surely , I could get , too,” I said. “Yes, no!” Margret said a little too quickly. “We’re very grateful to him for helping us.” “Yes,” Lilja said, and
