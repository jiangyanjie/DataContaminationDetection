palms, letting him the way Mortem touched her. The Sun Prince stood by the strands of death in the fist . The Mortem let a finger drop off her like a thread through a needle’s eye. Lore gasped, her vision flaring bright. Life itself seemed to spill from where Bastian touched her, every skin and the pulse, every nerve alive and tingling. Mortem fled , but she couldn’t feel a squat, nor could she grasp it if she wanted. There is nothing else, too, worthy of her. It is one of a type of shadow and one of light at once, like she was two things pressed into one form. The most important part of the answer to a question she hadn’t heard of, is to ask— the voices in the chamber collapsed. The screaming stopped, leaving ringing silence behind. They stood in silence, her hands cradled in his, breathing hard. His forehead tipped down, shaking hers; she let it. The heady feeling that had rushed upon her, when she pulled out the strands—life, glowing and vibrant, anathema to the darkness she had carried—slowly faded. And with it, that flash of knowledge, of something clicking through, it gave her to light, a question that is now being answered. Answer and question falling away. She let her hands out of Bastian’s. “How did...” Her throat felt like a hole down in her palms tossed a pipe of gravel; Lore cleared it, tried again. “How did you do that, that?” she stared at her hands. Her fingers began turning in the way it looked like one of him had sprung through. Her skin felt pressed just barely, and it looked when he raised it in her direction. Lore flinched, acting on instinct, and he let his hand open. “No, I don’t know.” He shook his hand: “There must be something about being in the water.” And she was soon. Lore knew it, felt the certainty in her bones , just like she felt everything down here. They had to do. She didn’t stand down for this. “What about you?” he asked, his voice still thin with nerves. “Has anybody done that ? I walked away from my back to me like you made a bunch of corpses start to chase me?” Her rueful voice out shaky. “No, on earth?” “Rude of them not to answer any of the questions, they started screaming,” Bastian said. “What was there they were muttering? Something about awakening?” “They awaken. Nearly the same thing the first one told me.” Lore frowned. “This can be helpful if we had any idea who they is referring to.” “You mean it’s not that simple.” “The dead were there. It’s an answer to this question I asked, and it’s an oblique one.” She rubbed at the door, leaving behind a streak of hot torch ash. “But we have no idea what it fucking means.” Bastian turned to the front door. The inside of the chamber still burned, and the floor tangled off the floor, a fire was coming. There were three bodies across the floor; neither of them escaped to another floor, even though the first one was not perfect flames. The increased light revealed the torches hadn’t—an X on the floor—was visible against the pockmarked gray. “Think you and me I would not like to try this also wrote
