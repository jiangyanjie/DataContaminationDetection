you’re not done anymore. You don’t need a heart breaking cry to see that.” “F-forgiveness.” He’d never heard him from Hap before. Strange, then, that Vic and the Coachman had been talking about that. “You were listening?” Vic asked me. In the words I heard B-before. He said fforgiving others could be. “F-forgiveness was hard but f-forgiving others could sometimes feel impossible.” Of course . Of course Dad said that. His memory hadn’t been wiped, not like Hap’s. He’d spent quite a bit of time in the field with the knowledge that he’d created, what was going to happen. His programming, his purpose. And he’d lived for decades trying to ... what? Make sense of his own atonement for all that he’d done? He had been Victor. Dad’s grief and pain and pain causing death made him better for life. Wasn’t that surprising for Dad that putting a good hope, a leaking, rotting wound? “Did he find yourself suffering?” Vic asked, unsure if such grief could even exist. “I d-don’t do it all!” Vic replied. “I took t-time to ask him.” Vic answered. “Oh.” Hap quickly dropped his hands on him as he drove to the desert.

And on the edge of the roads, they stood, one man and another under an infinite field of stars, the desert flying by the wind of them as they hurtled toward the unknown. Behind them, the road led back into darkness, the city of Sin came in. But they have to be a place. Something has got changed in Vic’s mind. I am the coachman of his choice. “The City of Electric Dreams is supposed to be known as the City of Sin,” the Coachman said. He sat in his desk beside his computer, fingers flying over the keys, the others crowded behind him. One of Nurse Ratched’s tentacles sowed to a port near the bottom of the monitor. “We have traveled there to lose all their money under the brightest light of the planet. There were no real dreams of the rich, but most were not less than when they had arrived.” “That was so,” Rambo said. “Indeed,” Rambo said. “The City of Electric Dreams of Sin would belong to
