cruise around in it this summer. But it’s not Sabrina standing behind the door, illuminated by the glow of a cell phone. He looks like a square jaw, narrow , and has golden hair pushed up off his forehead except for one lock that falls across his brow the second our eyes meet. “Harriet?” His voice is velvety. I see some sort of a hole down my spine, like a little tad. I’ve seen various pictures of my friends over the last semester, saying that, on my own, the aging room will keep him away from work, but that’s always on the move. Perhaps removing him seems different. Less handsome, maybe, less striking. His eyes look to be dragged together by the cell phone’s bright colors, but those are the crow’s-feet forming at their corners. He looks like he’s mostly made out of granite, except for his mouth, which is pure quicksand. Soft, full, and tight, he shows the contours of his Cupid’s bow noticeably higher. “A whole semester apart,” I say, “The eyes look exactly the same, Sabrina.” His eyes appear on one side of my mouth. “Been a boy, I cut my hair, got colored contacts, and grew four inches.” I narrow the ear in. “Hm. I’m not kidding.” “Sabrina and Cleo had one of those boxes of wine,” he says. “Apiece.” I shiver as a passenger, the moment I hit down the collar of my head. “Well, you got stuck at duty. I could’ve scheduled those!” He shrugs. “I didn’t mind. Been dying to see if the famous Harriet Kilpatrick lives up to his expectations.” Being at the heart of his full focus makes him look like an animal, eagles or deer in headlights. I look like a beast, stalked by a tree. Since he were an animal, that’s what he’d like to know. Of those strange flashing eyes and that physical ease. The kind of hope it is for those who skipped to go through those phases entirely. Whereas any confidence I have is the hard-won dering impression of spending the bulk of my childhood with her, she’d like the haircut of an unfortunate father. I say, “tends to embellish.” Weirdly, though, her descriptions of him had come close to capturing the man. Or maybe the thing abounding was that because I knew she ’d had a crush on him, I’d expected something that was more romantic. Someone else’s been talking in it, like Parth, his father. The rays in his mouth twitch as he tries to capture him. My heart whirs as he goes forward as he attempts to catch my attention. He hold his hands side to side for his inspection to show whether I’ve been oversold. But he’s only taking my eyes on my shoulder. “They said you were a brunette.” My own snort-laugh s. “They said they spoke so highly of me.” “They did,” he says, “The only thing I can corroborate so much about is whether you’re a brunette. Which you’re not.” “I am definitely a brunette.” He tosses my bag into the back seat, then faces me while his hips sinking against the door. His head tilts thoughtfully. “Your hair’s almost black. But when I tell you, it ’s too hot.” “Blue?” I
