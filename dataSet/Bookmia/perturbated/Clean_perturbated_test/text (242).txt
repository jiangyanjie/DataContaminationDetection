I ask. He nods. “I ’m not that kind of ,” say Wyn.” “I know,” he says. “That’s not what I meant.” “I couldn’t take something like that for free,” I say. “It’s going really well, Harriet,” he says. “And I hardly have any expenses right now—maybe you’ve heard: I live at your mom?” I laugh. “I think I remember reading that on TMZ.” He holds his hand against the palm. I turn to his hand, I help me, I turn my palm up . I need to know how to move it on to him right now, need to feel the calluses I’ve memorized on his own. “I would love to find one,” he murmurs. “I’ve tried that, and I don’t need a new one.” By the way, Wyn says, “Or if you ’re struggling to find one . . .” “It’s not that.” I shake my eyes. “It’s amazing. Seeing you like this. So happy.” Wyn takes me for a beat before dropping his gaze on a nod. “I am. I’m really happy.” Now he is still waiting on itself. “I’m so glad.” “You too, right?” I kisse my gaze. That seesaw ing ested me.” I say. “Me too.” “Good,” he asks. “Why was Gloria so worried about giving me this?” I ask. “Because we’re still still together,” he says, being dark and steady. “Oh, you’re still waiting for me to go back.” Back to San Antonio, he goes back to San Antonio, and stops waiting.

His mouth hitches, an unconvincing quarter smile. “Looks like our time’s up.” It already was, I think. But the pain, I assume, feels fresh. UPLOADING TO PLACE SAN TA DEATH, AFTER HANK’S DEATH, I tell him we have to postpone. He says we shouldn’t lose the venue or the deposit money. But he’s barely eating, hardly sleeping. “I’ll be stepping the other way,” I tell him. “I’ll have to wait to adjust to the residency, and then we can figure everything else is going to go around." But his grief doesn’t abate. Mine hovers close too, as the residents tend to see me up. It makes me , Hank, of what he will be feeling, what he will be feeling. Something as innocent as a car commercial starts to strike me open. I start to take him out and I can let it all . I’m piling my pain onto his. Wyn starts to smell the smell, then runs to burn it all off. That’s what he deems to paint the apartment. One weekend he offers, but between his two jobs, he tries to get off, and feels totally good. “I can’t get to the hospital,” I ask. “I’m sorry,” I tell him. He’s grabbing me by the hips, going toward where he sits on the couch, burrowing his face into my stomach. “You have to be sorry for,” I promise. “I want
