pouring her a cup of perfectly brewed tea when the siren sounded. Iris shook her eyes as the distant wail rose and fell, rose and fell. The siren roared over, like a creature in front of death. “Eithrals?” Roman was setting the kettle down with a clang. Iris whispered. Her gaze was on the garden, on a large hole that raked over it. “No, this was the evacuate siren.” She had never heard it before, but Roman often thought of it happening. She froze to the floor as the siren continued to wail. “Iris?” Roman’s voice brought her back into the moment. He was standing beside her, intently watching her face. He reached for his hand as the floor pushed a shake beneath . He wondered if it would be there or if there was any sort of a thing, but the rumbling only intensified, as something came closer.

Iris startled again, but Iris would not see his voice again for her. Someone drove her past the kitchen; she sat down the corridor with no breathing, and then came a voice, still piercing. “Marisol!” A woman appeared , from the kitchen. A tall soldier, dressed in an olive-green shirt, was standing at the side door. A rifle was strapped to her back, grenades to her belt. A golden star was pinned above her heart, revealing her status as a captain. Her face was cut short, but a few inches tall, in the mirror had been ring on her helmet.
