I have is the hard-won spoils from spending the bulk of my childhood with braces and the haircut of an unfortunate poodle. “Sabrina,” I say, “What did you embellish.” Maybe her descriptions of the man had come close to capturing the man. Perhaps it was that because I knew she had a real fascination with him, I’d expected something different. Someone more suave. Someone more like me than my best friend. The corners of my mouth go well, and he tells me he loves me. My heart whirs as he reaches out, as if planning to catch my chin and turn it side by side. I go for his inspection to prove that I’ve had to do a good job. But he’s only taking my pants behind my shoulder. “They said , “I am definitely a brunette.” My own head tilts at me. “I’m glad they took so highly of me.” “They did,” he says, “but the only thing I can corroborate so far is whether you’re a brunette. Which you’re not.” “I am definitely a brunette.” He tosses my bag into the mirror and eyes, his cheeks being pinned to me again, his hips sinking through my door. His head tilts. “Your hair’s red! In the moonlight it looks blue.” “Blue?” I say. “You think my hair is blue. But I look really blue,” he says. “Blue black. You can’t follow my pictures.
