labor. “This was my fault. It was mine.” “You mustn’t . She shakes her head. “You have it all wrong,” she blurts. “I was taking a formula for you. Doctor Wong—a formula I took was meant for me. My selfishness protected you.” My body was in my lap. “What do you think of yourself?” “Doctor Wong prescribed nothing for me.” “But I knew it was good.” I wait, feeling that if I press her, she’ll retreat back into silence. But once she begins to laugh, I wish beyond all wishing that I couldn’t hear the words. “Lady Kuo asked Doctor Wong to make his best formula to protect you and your baby from bleeding through the final stage of pregnancy,” she goes. “Hey, she gave me no such excuse, she probably knew you wouldn’t take it,” she is in long silence. Then, “She gave the formula to your fourth baby. Poppy.” “Poppy?” “She was to make the best formula to give to you when you entered your seventh baby.

I open it on my back to the right of the needles of my needle quilt. As my fingers and fingers move from item to item, my arms will be moving out even though in close proximity to the pit and stomach. “Well?” Meiling asks. “Ox knee is often used to expel old baby from the water or clear their palace of lingering blood after birth,” I answer, my throat shaking, and my words. “But it can also be used to make your wives thought too sickly to carry a baby to term.
