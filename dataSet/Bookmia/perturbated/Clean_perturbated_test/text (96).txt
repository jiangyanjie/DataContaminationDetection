him into the office. It took an anxious moment to be able to understand where his father was . “But I want to support her. For Iris. “She’s not Sarah,” Roman said , with a cold voice. Mr. Kitt’s gaze returned to his. “Oh? And where is she coming out? I don’t know. I haven’t looked here since I was promoted.” There were a few times when silence came . Roman could feel Sarah’s glance . He watched doors , granting Mr. Kitt wide open open to the few of the windows. He also halted, watching through swirls of cigarette smoke. Roman cleared his head. “Why are you—” “I made the first choice for you , Elinor Little,” Mr. Kitt said . One o’clock sharp at Monahan’s. You’ll be marrying her in three weeks, and your mother thought it would be nice if the women could be married. “So then, you spent some time together.” Roman forced himself to swallow a retort.

Marisol was at its zenith when the lorry rumbled into town. Iris was walking her along a highway carrying baskets of goods they had bartered for at the point when the truck arrived . Iris didn’t know what to think of it—its massive tires were coated in a metal body and bullets. It rolled in from the western road, which Iris knew led to the war front. “Oh my gods,” Marisol said with a gasp. She turned on her belt and ran, carrying it to the lorry as she was surrounded by another road. Iris had no choice but to pick her basket and follow her. “Marisol! Marisol, what’s happening?” Marisol said in his mind. When Iris heard her, she didn’t slow. Her black hair was like a pennant as she raced, as everyone around her said nothing. So she decided to keep on pushing herself as a huge crowd approached the lorry. It parked at the infirmary, and that was when Iris, sore with her crouch with a stitch in her side, realized what this was. The driver stepped in, pulling a load of wounded trucks into another road. “I’d get the truck now. Easy.” “Where’s a
