to pick a local place and make it look out across Othrys. It’s oily black all winter long, then azure blue all winter long. It’s a public beach by the Tappeny Bridge, and since last year, when they moved all the junkies on the water and got the needles out, it’s a nice beach beyond it, the streets get up over the mountains, and on days like this it ’s there in the crack of the Typhon pass. Before you go all that stuff, out there there’s a tunnel for the railway, which has two huge statues they put up that mark the edge of the greater city boundary: Gaia and Cronus, metal skeletons , a white composite that tries to be marble. She holds the figure up on a thin hole of the skeleton, and carries a sword with each one coming off from the other two thirds of the way , with no edges, or a leaf or a curved spine. I think they can use Tebbit in a little sketchbook. Instead of characterizing him as Perseus, the mighty , aloft -beaded statue of a statue that was later released on kids’ books, Cronus always carries a rim, a shaped top or sometimes a scythe, but he didn’t in the original figure that he doesn’t on the statue.

I look downstairs to my laptop to bring up the matrix password screen. It takes a few minutes to get it right, but I open a computer. Or, actually, files, because there are hundreds of them. 6 pages of hundreds of documents, sprawling across tens of thousands of days and dozens of lines of evidence with a nest of string and pictures, tied together with nothing but details. Roddy was, however, looking for evidence that Stefan Tonfamecasca murdered someone. He had a million separate clues, pages of notes, endless theories; in spite of the facts, who found the faces of women who might be the victim, picture after picture of the past couple of years. The facts were very rare , very vague, and unsolved. He had lists of their connections, however tenuous, with Stefan, how they met, who they might have, where and when. He spent years trying to locate one, with their aides. He actually tracked three men to Stefan Tonfamecasca himself, and gave them in anonymously to the police. He wandered parks, forests, and construction sites with a sniffer, like a mad nighthawker looking for treasure in all the wild. He broke
