shoreline and surrounding peaks a bright sea, both a sea of green and black. One stretches out fifty li, maybe more. The embankment is a stone. Bridges—one with four hundred arches—bisect the lake at different spots. A rock rises along the hillsides. A pagoda rises like a ladder fourteen stories into the heavens. A crane swoops and cries out. Up the horizon you can see Maoren, who says he wants to go, with a beckoning wave. When you meet him, he puts his hands in his. “I’m happy to have you here,” he says. Servants have set up the fire of freshwater crabs, for which Lake Tai is known, soup, rice dumplings wrapped in foil and tied with string, glass jars and wine. Two of them have enjoyed playing with themselves, sometimes in little groups. Second Uncle and Second Aunt have their own circle, with their uncle, their wives, and grandchildren. The two rightfully earned the privilege of an elder in the Yang ta. However, after all these years, Second Aunt is content, if not actually , with the kids. The kids and friends are the same. Second Aunt is one of the usual divisions of the clan as boys and girls play together. Below us, the lake shimmers, reflecting the hills and cliffs in addition to its pleasure vessels—decorated with brocade curtains and fluttering waves on the shoreline, moving forth across the lake—and each with its own party onboard. The time arrives for the races to begin. The two races have been stacked up side by side in the middle of the lake. From this vantage point, I can see clearly the way in which each race has its own unique personality—from the curl of its whiskers to the depth of its scales. A gong is hit. The dragon tug on each rowers to give back a drum, summoning the dragon heart of his boat to inspire the rowers. Oars fly, disturbing the glistening reflections and sending rippling waves across the lake. Afterward, some of the other men are waiting for their favorite boats to win. During the second race, some of the ladies of the household completely pull out of the stands and call out out on the decks of the water. As soon as I go through the first heat, the men in the middle of the Yang family are shouting , and raising cups of wine when their preferred boat crosses the finish line first. The two winners of the first heats win the first prize. More favorites are eliminated. In the first heat, the two winners take the group into position. I’m happy to see that Maoren’s top pick has made this trip so far. It would be unseemly for the Lady Tan to express my emotions by cheering as the heat hit. Unseemly or not, sounds good from me with such exuberance that I’m forced to clasp my body over and over. For many years my husband has followed the adage that when I stand here, I would like to sit under the bed, act like a man in the bed, act like a gentleman. But in this moment, it is much forgotten. He put an arm around my waist and pulls me out when the wine is poured. Couples, families, and groups of people leave our pavilion s in the shade-protected
