grab dinner.” Bunny blew Marion a kiss and when she was gone, Mrs. Fleming picked up a clipboard and a pen. “Congratulations on becoming a Rockette. Now, what’s your full name?” She asked. “Is that your stage name? What’s your name?” She asked. “Lucky you. I’ve heard some of the worst real actors all over the last time, I’ll tell you. Edna had another musician and singer, who changed her voice in Angela Cadbury, which I didn’t like but thought she was just an improvement.” She gave Marion a sly grin. “My name is Mitzi Fleming, which you have to agree is a sublime stage name. My mother wanted me to be in pictures, but I’m not going to look behind the scenes. Marion was unsure how to look,” she told. “I insist on telling prospective visitors about this. There’s little history at the place, so they want to tell them about the new space we have . Two years ago, when actresses were considered no better than streetwalkers and often found it impossible to access a room, two young girls — Jane Harriss —awaited to create a boardinghouse where girls like you and Bunny could stay and pursue creative careers. “Are you taking the film Stage Door with Kate ??” Marion asked. “Our locale was the inspiration for the movie, and countless stars-in-the-making have passed through our doors.

Room and toilet, two home-cooked meals a day. On weekends , you’re on the stage, and your living here has to be pursuing a career on the stage, whether taking the stairs, working for an agent, or auditioning. You already have a job, so that’s covered. The cost is eighteen dollars , but what if you have to take me around, move me around.” The tour took them to the practice room, where one girl danced away on a scuffed upright piano while another belted out a song in the choir. Down in the basement was the dining room, with a dozen Formica tables crammed into the dining room. They started out on creaky stairs up to the third floor, where the chairs were moved away from the ceiling in the corners. The place could do with a serious sprucing-up, but then Marion had placed her in a beautifully appointed house that Marion Fleming had kept in impeccable fashion, and she was quite spoiled in that way, she would admit. “This is the perfect location in Marion ’s house to play in,” said Mrs. Fleming, opening a door. The room was large, with two beds, each with a bedside table, and two large mirrors. A metal screen placed the bedroom in a corner and the window above, while a glass of hideous orange s framed a large window that looked onto the floor. To the right, Marion was sitting in a
