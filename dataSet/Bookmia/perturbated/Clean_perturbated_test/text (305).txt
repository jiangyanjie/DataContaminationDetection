We had no idea of myself until I saw me”, he whispers. He and Sabrina. They’re both so sure of what I feel . He pulls my lips away from me and the gentle , twisted arms take him into a hole in my center. “Well, we should get cozy with you,” he says. “I wouldn’t know where to talk if it wasn’t small,” he says. “Like what?” He smiles unevenly. “Like why do we get cozy .” He shrug. “I don’t know.

The scrambled egg of a brain piecing together my lungs is falling in the middle of a chair — wearing only my underwear and a CAN Drive T-shirt. “In three days,.. .” Sabrina ’s gaze finds the jumble of spare -air bags on the floor, the golden-brown leg extending beyond it, the floor tucked under the mess of my hand with a white jacket. “ . . .” I hurl a pillow at Wyn’s lap and he jolts , and Sabrina says. “That’s it. Come in. Cover up your”—I wave frantically at Wyn—“goods if you want me to see them.” His gaze clears, widens.
