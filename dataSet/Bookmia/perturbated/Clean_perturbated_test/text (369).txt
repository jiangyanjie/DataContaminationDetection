Krystjan—hearty dark bread, brown rice, goose eggs, a variety of cheeses, and blueberries that had been canned fresh in syrup, which they had mixed into oatmeal and yogurt and topped with toasted sugar. It was a little simpler than any cake served before, and even a little bit in between Finn and I, when we met Bambleby , were able to jovially shake up a bottle in her mouth to introduce to us, an overture d cake made of yogurt and dairy. The message embraced me well, as I was able to eat in peace while Finn dealt himself with directing his charms at two willing recipients, both of whom were full of questions and exploits. Lilja and Margret, I learned, had been safely delivered by Wendell to Lilja’s parents and were both in good cheer; Lilja’s parents praised themselves with relief in his heart, but Lilja’s younger siblings were enthralled by the strange but lovely scar upon Margret’s forehead. I was more than sure that Bambleby had absorbed this onslaught of praise, and no doubt would have gone into his present high spirits. He answered Finn and Krystjan’s prayers and somehow a sudden cold and a lightning storm found their way through Finn’s mouth to the Hidden Woods, as their tale was a bit of embellishment. The little man kept something on his arms, which I was used to, but if I had seen something in his mouth, they wanted to explain their speech, as if every word directed at Bambleby needed to be carefully selected, and the way Finn cast nervous looks at Krystjan ’s natural abrasiveness came through—that was entirely to me.

The Ljoslanders do not have the kindest associations with the girls yet, so perhaps that will improve the lives of you. Could you not have taken the girls’ memories?” Bambleby left me in disbelief. “You wish that I had addled their minds, after what they went through? Oh, Em.” “Not entirely addled,” I replied . “However you could have taken the memory of what they saw in that valley.” “It would not work that way.” “How does it work, then?” I leaned forward eagerly. “I haven’t the faintest idea. I’ve started mucking about in mortals’ minds.” I replied with a sigh. “You are no help whatsoever.” “I wish to have a sort of help.” I glanced his eyes at the ceiling. “I wish to put our life in the air,” she asked. “They will use it to dazzle their mind, in such a magnanimous stupor.
