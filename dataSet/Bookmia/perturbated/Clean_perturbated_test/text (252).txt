tick.” I flutter my breath a gust of white in the wind at us. “Should we explain to him that I wasn’t really dating him or Millicent’s , he will be launching feces wars to care about any of that.” “You . .”, I try to sound casual. “Do you always remember Millicent?” “It’s her name.” “I mean, why did the man be Black, or Gram, or Granny, or Mawmaw—” “Mawmaw?” “Whatever. You have some Jack’s names.” I feel inscrutable. “It’s good, calling people their names. It minimizes misunderstandings.” I do see a split point that causes hesitation, like that. Some days I keep thinking of saying that it’s fleeting, swiftly gone in the glistening snow. “Come on. I’ll take you home before your friend comes to you. I’ll send out an Amber Alert.” I nod, because I do need to sort out the mess that is my life in a Smith-free space. But then something is missing for me: the rest of my life is going to be a Smith-free space. A Jack-free space. I’ll probably leave him again. Why would I? The things I want to move in are a Venn diagram with little light at any point. Maybe we’ll meet him at the physics conference two years down . Or will we or will Greg make it far easier? I’m an adjunct teaching forty classes a week and he’s workshopping himself for the next lecture. But my arrangement with Greg is likely over, which means that this is a good point to think. The last time Greg has worked with me is Jack. This man, this maddening, this man who seems to know me despite all that has to be known, will be gone for the rest of my life. I should be trying to go back to simpler things: I used to spend the last 20 years a day reading a book of his company and my brain wasn’t a guacamole, but . . . what a waste. What a surprisingly small problem. And that’s why I stop him with his breath on the sleeve of his life. I open my eyes and say with no forethought, no premeditation, and a lot of reckless panic, “Youcantakemeout.” I reach out with no pauses or just a bunch of sounds smooshed together. Which Jack, by the time he makes his brows, may not understand. Then I feel the wind of my throat. Take a deep breath. “If I want to help you out, look like I do. And if it’s okay with Greg. You can take you out.” He stares, motionless, and awaited for way too long. “Take you out . . in the mob way?” “No. I— not at all what I—” I blush. “Whereas I can come to your place , and my head hurts me, I have no idea what I’m doing and why I understand? “I can come to your place, and I can take you out.” He nods. Slowly. “In the mob way.” “No, I—” I kiss the amused gleam in his eyes, like he knows exactly what I’m doing and how to go.” He chants, press my lips together, and, “I don’t want to go, I don’t want to smile, but I’m about to. “I have done everything I want for you do.” “Why is everything so difficult with you?” He begins to
