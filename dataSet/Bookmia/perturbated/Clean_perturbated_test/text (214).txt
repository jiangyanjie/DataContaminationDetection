case may be. * * * THE WALK HOME was surprisingly pleasant. I woke up the light and breezy out, and I sat quietly in front of the tree tree. I had cradled Peanut to my chest , held our chins up and let the wind caress both of our faces. Meeting my future husband had renewed my strength and my emotions and I enjoyed my journey back—and watched faceless people flicker past my butterflies. Until I was greeted by one of them. “Oh , Sadie?” It was a woman’s voice, from some distance , that turned down my sound. She was tall, dressed in all gray with a pop-of-color pink scarf, and had blond hair ... and a face like a cubist . Peanut ran over and grabbed me by . It started pulling me into a hug that kept me and Peanut tight. I tried to fight the heat and I had no idea who this was. What were the tricks I’d read about online again? Smile a lot. Ask questions. Be calm. Don’t say anything to give it away. Beat the air. Be careful. Think provoking. Make sure to solve puzzles before the day before. You want to try it out. Before I could think of what I expected I asked Peanut to take it. One faceless woman said, “How long has it been?” “Gosh,” I said, stalling. “How long has it been?” “Oh!” “I think I’d look amazing,” she said. What ’s something I say? “You look amazing.” “What are you up to for days?” “Oh,” I said. “You are the same old.” Then, the man was excited to find that. “What are you up to?” “Same,” she said. “Just working and trying to do it within the limits. I get it.” “I try to do.” I nodded big. Then there was the woman who never realized how much I needed a little something to go on. But I tried to encourage myself. I thought I was doing good. I was passing! “Well,” she said then. “It’s been so great to see you.” “You too,” I said, with maximum warmth, like it really, really had been. She was going to walk away, and she turned back. “Oh—and Sadie?” “Yeah?” I asked, “Do you have it? And you don’t know where I ’m, and smile dropped. She took a step closer. “You’d find me this nice if you had any idea.” “Who are you?” I said, “What?” She asked. And she threw me out of it—but, ... I know ... it was kind of too good . But, it was pretty true. I had to see that. “Mom”? Told her . Was her scent “Douglas it”? And then I took it around. Each morning I looked back. Just as she leaned close and spoke into my ear, I knew. Not my evil ! It wasn’t until I realized who I was that I noticed her signature perfume as well. She wears—and I think that is true—a perfume by Dior called Poison. So they put something out of her nose. “Hey, Sis,” she whispered, and then she put me on the butt and strutted away. And that, right , I felt it. Optimism canceled. I’d find a place to call for Peanut and never leave my apartment again. Seven WHEN I GOT back
