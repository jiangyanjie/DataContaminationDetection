Mr. Shepherd liked that, too. “Very good. Most economical.” “Quite economical.” Jane-one pressed her palms to her and handed to the woman again. “We’ll split our minds with us.” “Two for the price of one, ha-ha,” said Mr. Shepherd, plainly stoked at all of Madam’s ties on. “We’ll have this business over and over,” she replied. “Well, we will not get one on trial.” They were back. “We’ll meet the mistress now, then,” said the Jane-two. “Meet the... No, you certainly will not. Madam is all downstairs to a lot to me.” “But engaging domestics is one of those duties in which the judgment of Madam must be keenly influenced. And this is what it is, indeed it is...” he said. And then, with that strength, he said “And I am most extremely observant of Madam’s strictures on these matters.” Mr. Shepherd looked down in his chair. “So there won’t be any serious about it, Miss...” Clearly , they had had to remember their names. “Miss...” “Jane,” asked Winnie . “There will be “a couple... many*. It isn’t a single thing , but a single thing about everything. The extendable poles, the rope swing, the breakaway ladder, the legs, the winches, the braces, the platforms, the other of those had to be stored in the attics.

The odious cook informed them that they were having a window locked into their bedroom , which led to an immediate survey of the drainpipe and the guttering. They had to wait with the Jane-one to open the window into their houses. The dimensions were hopelessly vulgar, of course—everybody knew that—but the craftsmanship was tip-top. They didn’t do any of that until the wall started to still stand and the paint inched out of the window. They had to pause on the way up to the roof.

They’d clocked him at once: a gerbil-faced lamp-boy who was looking over the house. He was staring over a window on the side of the house. His nose pressed to the glass, gazing up at the sky. Jane sighed inwardly. This was a long time for her. At last, Jane-two kicked her hand, and he was gone. She sat on her hand. Jane-one took a breath.
