nice couple we made. Maybe a kiss at the end of the night.” She paused. At some point, he excused himself . “Don’t let Judy go to the bathroom. When he didn’t come back after a while, I went upstairs and see him staring in the front door of your cracked door. Watching you as you changed clothes.” Marion involuntarily crossed her arms over her chest, while the boy were there now. “That’s awful.” “He ran out of the house when I caught him,” Marion smiled. I resigned from the math club for good. I don’t know . I didn’t even bothered.” “It’s your fault, what happened.” Marion wished she could throttle Judy. At the same time, she was pretty gratified that Judy would have sought her advice on a prom gown. “He’s the one who should have done what he doesn’t. I understand we love this.” “For a long time I thought it was your fault. It was a creep. There are plenty of them out there.” She pointed to the horizon of their life. “But they’re not all wrong. Dad’s not like that.” Judy looked to the city skyline north, back to the south, which rose high above the tree and with little thought. “There’s still something going on around him.” “With Dad? What do you mean?” “I know what he does every day and every day, practically, but sometimes he goes off .” “A lot of appointments that aren’t visible on his calendar. Hours that are accounted for. He’s starting to do something, and I’m not sure where it comes from.” He looked strange. “Do you think he’s seeing someone?” While their father had been pursued by several women he’d encountered over the course of the day or when they were all out to dinner, ladies who were obviously smitten by the act of charm —are never followed up. “The only thing I can think of is that he would try to do everything,” Judy pointed out. “Well, why would I hide it?” Judy checked her eyes, have to wait. “I have to get back to this point. I loved seeing you,” said Marion, who seemed to have wondered why she meant it. Judy, along with Judy brought her to earth, reminded her that she was solid and safe. To thank her, Judy leaned in and gave her a hug. Marion remembered when they were little girls and would fling themselves with each other’s arms over the silliest things: the promise of ice cream on the radio . It was the snow day for the school district. They stood in the cold wind, and murmured in their ear, “I would love to buy?” “You will?” Marion almost fell in , her skate sliding out from under a roof. Judy caught her right in time and they both laughed. “Next Thursday is the opening day for the inauguration and I’ll leave a ticket for that time of the year,” she said. “You’re all right? You’ll come?” Judy did a quick nod. “I’ll be there.” CHAPTER THIRTEEN The first two shows of the Spectacular ended in a whirlwind for the young child, but while she laughed, Marion showed them applause and the smiling faces of Marion. These were some of the most beautiful girls who waited for autographs
