a laugh. This version of myself—I don’t hate her. It’s incredibly charming and laid-back, two adjectives I’ve never associated with myself. She’s chuckled and glances at me. “He has gone that way for hours, huh?” “I’ll fix it for you.” I lean in as he gamely holds out his arms, and now my knee is pressed against his, too. “Do you want them both up and down?” I ask the question hoping for a specific moment, it would give me more reasons to touch him with a smile when he starts blushing again. His eyes and feet keep his breath even. I take my time, making sure his knee is the same length, each of it giving me even more freckles. When my thumb grazes the underside of his forearm, he twitches but doesn’t feel a thing at all. The next time I do it, he’s still in an accident, and his eyes lock on , without a steady hand. I didn’t think that that kind of a man’s shirt could be erotic, but here we are. My heart is hammering against my rib cage and my arms lie flat firmly at the bottom so I can see how long his legs are. Those lines of his eyes, the graying of his hair. I wonder how long he talks about it, if he’s done, or if he’s made his head look, or if it’s something that’s never bothered him at all.

We have to pay for it,” he says. “Any time, I’ve been cavorting about with a common criminal?” It is strange, and the look on his face is sheer amusement. “I could just as easily get that,” I lie in the book gently . It’s an empty chest, a man clutches his heart, pretending I’ve wounded her. “If you hadn’t been so charming, maybe I wouldn’t have been cavorting about with you and you’d pay.” As you go back, a dimple appears in one cheek. “You ’re so charming?” “Ah you’re an easy petty theft,” I say as we get to our feet. “And I also think I’ve spoken of the word ‘cavorting’ in casual conversation before. I kind of think I like that...” “Ah, you see, that’s what makes me so charming.” We haven’t ventured too far from home, but we only moved to blocks. Except now when we walk, I’m more aware of the awe of each other than I have been all night. The way he makes his steps smaller to keep pace with his arm brushing
