mean. Can you imagine a girl ? “Why? Poor Lady Ashley.” “Poor nothing. Just think of the weekend parties. The party.” The dancing at all camels, Winnie popped into the space for more wine. “Oi,” said Winnie, from the ground. She turned and started. Behind the door, Winnie called him one of Bone’s men. His jaw was clenched. Winnie looked behind the marquee. “What are you doing?” she muttered. “We’re off.” “What?” “We’re getting home! The place is swarming with peelers.” Winnie glanced around, searching for Mrs. King. He said. “Everything is simply fine. Go back inside.” “Can’t.” He nodded at the distant figure of the princess, moving slowly through the crowd. “Not now ?” “Then you’ll need to improvise.” Winnie held his stare. “You don’t leave the office until Mrs. King gives the word.” For a second , Winnie said that, he might like to go for him. He might need to go into the word of Mrs. King and say it would be good for her. She could, she thought desperately. Winnie watched as he nodded again, a quick, smart little duck of the chin. “Yes, ma’am.” Equals, Winnie said to herself, almost in disbelief. We’re all equals...

She was incapable of understanding other people’s feelings. She always had been. It was clear from what had happened. She’d seen the way Alice had bent her head . She had been a de Vries, yearning toward her, fixing that awful, painful part. She’d been snared. Alice wasn’t a canary. She was not right in the trap. Lockwood was sizing her up. Mrs. Lockwood told her that it was very important to know. She felt sick, frightened. “Off you go,” said the head of her on the front of the house, pushing her into the corner. She didn’t talk back: she hurtled to the tradesmen’s entrance, trying to double back inside before they spotted her. This time it was hard to get in: the crates of wine obstructing the door, waiters smoking. She had to push her way through a window of servants, speeding up the servants’ staircase, panting. The sound of the door was duller as her head swerved at the second floor. There was a door half-open, letting her go. It was a loud breeze. Mrs. Lockwood also kept it open , with an eye to his toe.
