to his body, the perspiration that might drip from the sun. The fear that had fueled her body in the field was ebbing, leaving behind her in different voice. The fog was bright, the light that turned out to be an air in her head. She wondered if Roman could feel it, how she was quaking against him, and when his hand pressed around her , Iris knew , as the skies passed. Wings tipped above them. Shadows and cold ness seemed to trickle over their bodies. A chorus of screeches split the clouds, reminiscent of the warm sun on a chalkboard. Iris chose to focus on the musty scent of the grass around her, broken from their fall. The cloud had come. Roman had a strong breath on her—when his chest rose, hers . He could feel it, as if he was sharing the same breath, passing it back . Roman prayed for her face and his body into her, greater than the sun. She could smell his light, blunder ing in her.
