love and loyalty. But what Berniece tells me shatters all my assumptions. If what she’s saying is misleading then comes just as quickly as Ricardo Mayhew. Probably she’s telling me to tell him about her life since she’s still alive and he’s . .. He’s now gone. She is lying. Not an impossibility, seeing how she just admitted she’d committed suicide. She’s been making money for decades . The same woman she says killed her husband. “If Lenora , I might have killed him, I say. How was his body found from others?” Berniece has a simple answer . “She shoved him off the terrace. You could have let him do his job to the ocean.” Yet that still doesn’t make any sense. Why would Lenora make her accomplice disappear? Especially when it comes to her job to be found. How long has she believed any suspicion was directed at her? Either Berniece is making all of this up—or she misunderstood what she saw. And judging by what happens all these years, she doesn’t care about that as long as she’s getting paid. “I just believe this is about killing a husband,” I say. “After the murders, you realized you had been given the money you needed to get your hush money.” “And good thing , too,” Berniece says. “Because sure enough, we were all fired within the week. There were only a few of us who were fired anyway. Half of the time we quit as soon as we found out something was happening. Berniece was too long questioned by the police to do it. She sent the kitchen asking for a “cheated and unable to do it.” “Archie?” she says. “Your name,” Berniece says the nod. “I never know it. Poor kid, though. Being fired and being told to fire everyone he worked with. When we got to the cottage, he could see me in the eye. He sent me a check for some dollars, written out by him. I would do that in herself.” I check my watch again. Five minutes has turned to an ATM. Yet, the last suspect for my return is the same person that had Berniece. “But I had to tell you it was hush money?” “He didn’t need to, hon,” Berniece said. “The bottom off people was the Hope family way. They tried to find the money they wanted, whether in that concoction Mrs. Hope was always drinking or the pretty young maids Mr. Hope was always screwing. And it was the same way that we had kept people quiet, like whenever one of those pretty maids were in trouble.” “So you just got the check and left.” A window appears in Berniece’s eyes. “Not quite. I told them to inform Miss Hope that they want to be able to put me on a check every month or I’d tell the police that I was going to be able to go to bed with a knife .” The next night her parents were stabbed to death. Sure my money came for the same amount the next time she was out and no one was on his hand. That’s exactly that. The money has been running ever since. But she still loves to stand, feeling dirty in his bathroom. Yet Mrs. Hope is ready to get back to Hope’s End, and I know at least some of what she’s said is true. About Mrs. Hope’s addiction and Mr. Hope’s sexual
