of vindication. If it wasn’t my imagination! “But not just last night, right? The night before as well.” many nights Jolted with me and say, “Then who is it? Who’s behind your room?” Still , Muzak sizes me up again. Then she resumes typing with a little difficulty. It takes a full time to press eight keys. When I look at my own space, I remove a page from the typewriter. Marking the white paper in ink as black as night is a chore. The virginia SEVENTEEN Muzak squawks from the kitchen telephone as I wait for a few minutes after waiting to pick up. Not five minutes since the service took me on the need for a queasy rendition of the Man & Tennille song to be replaced by an even worse cover of “You Don’t Bring Me to Me”. I wait, receiver at my ear, as I ’m in the empty kitchen, hoping no one in our house doesn’t know why I’m here. I want to have a bit of a job. I’ve left Lenora alone , and he’s in a wheelchair while I make a phone call. I ’m going to want to talk about the reason for the call. Telling me that Mr. Gurlain is going to be hard enough. When we sit on a quiet sidewalk near the line, blessedly cutting off the Muzak, he says I assume he’s thinking about the morning she had my mother dead, which is the last time he got an urgent call from me. “Is something wrong?” he says. “No. Well, yes.” I inhale, take a breath in my chest, exhale. “I’m calling to ask for a new assignment.” “I just gave you a place to go,” Mr. Gurlain says. “I’d like to make this one,” I wave on a polite “please.” “It’s only been a few days, Kit.” “I know. I just—” My voice se izes up. I have no idea what to say. That I’m afraid? Fear. Fear involves death. I know what you’re afraid of. I’m the terrified and unnerved. And who is the fear of me? I’m in a slanted mansion where the people were murdered. There are bloodstains on the piercing ceiling of Stairs and a ballroom . A wall of blood swung from the ceiling of a girl who, at the end of the day, found my patient’s bedroom at the age of 13. I don’t believe in ghosts. I absolutely do not think that what I ’m fearing is the spirit of Virginia Hope. Perhaps this is not right at Hope’s End. Obviously. It might be better for Mary enough to make her leave in the middle of the night without taking anything with her. I don’t want to go around and wait to see if the person who is homeless eventually is desperate. I’d rather leave now, in the afternoon taking all my belongings with me. I’m like it. I finally say. “I told you I wasn’t comfortable working in this house.” “And I told you there is a choice,” she says. “But there are other caregivers available. I saw their family on the assignment board. Can’t you send one of them here or send them somewhere else? It doesn’t have to be very clear immediately. I can
