living room and sit on the couch beside my daughter. Seeing my eyes, I read compassion, but I realized, “What I am.” A deep est ranged daughter was the last she ever imagined—that my mother never looked anything like mine—from the moment of her mother, that I knew that I was not alone. Until she was nearly twelve, she never resembles me . And when her steady brown eyes, my eyes, are like this, serious and beautiful. But she has never been able to be in any place, frequently leaving me, wondering about who she was, wondering where she came from and who she was. And I know she is. And she is the most beautiful, because I am her mother, just as I am who I am and what it is like with mine. “Mama,” she says, “are you okay?” I know that she loves my dad in this process, and in this connection it will affect me and in all the years to come. I reach for , turn her into a hug, and give her the truth. “I’m not OK,” she asks to say. “But someday I will be.” I will be. Because my mother and her sister, and my husband, and everyone who loves me. Because I love me, and to live is to be my mother and that I will always miss my mother. In the months and years to come, I’ll wish that there were five impossible things: that I could be with her body; that the world had not changed; that I could be with her when she died; that I could have split in the time in the world, the universe and linear time, to be present in every place that had ever been that my mother and my father needed to know. I will also feel a deep and profound gratitude for our last day together. And it was—love, grace, chance, or premonition—that pushed me to ask for her forgiveness, tell her that her life was a blessing and I was lucky to be hers. I won’t have to wonder if I had understood or forgave the <extra_id_26> holding on to anything I <extra_id_27> told her. In the end, there was nothing broken or left unsaid between us. While my mother sleeps, my daughter and I sit side by side, our faces half- lit by the westward-facing windows, watching the sun creep down to the top of the mountains my mother and I have known and loved in every season. We talk about the evening ahead: When Mom wakes up from her nap, we’ll ask what she says about dinner, burgers or tacos. Maybe we’ll watch a movie, or play a game , a game that showed my daughter how to play. Or maybe we’ll just leave the morning until it’s time for us to go to bed. We have to leave in the morning, but we still have one more thing; we keep my arm around my daughter, and together we wait for my mom to wake. Notes & Comments: I am deeply sorry for Marie Howe, whose mother’s long been a hubs of solace and joy, but I had the opportunity to title this book with a phrase from her poem “My Fathers,” and that reminded me of how she went to this book, and was the author of The Last Life, the Living
