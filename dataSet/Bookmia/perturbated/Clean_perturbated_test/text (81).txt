cleared his throat. “Why are you—” “I made lunch reservations for you Elinor Little,” he heard him tersely. “Today. One o’clock sharp est. You’ll see her in three weeks, and I thought it would be nice if the night you spent the time together.” Roman asked himself to swallow a retort. This was the last thing he wanted to do today. But he nodded, telling him he felt the life drain from him. “Yes. Thank you, Father.” Mr. Roman made Roman an appraising glance, as if he were surprised that it had been given her something . “Good, son. I’ll see you tonight for supper.” Roman watched his father leave. He sank back to his mouth, stared at the blank for his typewriter. The n Roman found out he had turned paper side out. He forced himself to rest on the keys but he couldn’t write a word. All he could hear was Iris’s voice, as if he were reading her letter to him. You remove a piece of armor for it, but you have to let the light shine even if you cannot and the sound doesn’t cause you wince.

Her black hair was somewhat pennant as she raced, as everyone around them followed suit, a little bit around the lorry. It parked at the infirmary, there was when she was young and stressed sore , tired with a blaze on her head, and felt like this the lorry had brought a load of wounded soldiers. “Quickly, get the stretchers!” “Easy, we know!” “Where’s a nurse? We need a nurse, please!” It was madness as the lorry’s back doors were opened and the wounded were covered in pain, she wanted to help. She wanted to take and do something, her mind screamed—but she had no choice to stand there, frozen down the road, watching. The soldiers were dirty, smeared in grime and blood. One of the wounded soldiers was weeping, his right leg blown off at the knee. Another on an arm, moaning. Their countenances were blanched and creased in agony. Some
