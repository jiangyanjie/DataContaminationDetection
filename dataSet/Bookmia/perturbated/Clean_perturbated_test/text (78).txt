person I thought was responsible. Since Carter isn’t related to anyone, he’ll inherit nothing. There was no reason and I have to stop both him and Mary from finding that out. A friend wrote to me just a few weeks after that. Lee Lenora says. “She’d heard what happened and said that, under the circumstances, it would be best if she continued to raise the child as her own. I didn’t protest.” My son, at her, shocked. “But he was your father. What did you think I should have done?” “Kept him!” I cry. “Raised him. Loved him. And you just said I should have let Virginia love him.” “And what kind of life would that have been? For both Virginia and the children she didn’t want to give him, let alone feed him. She couldn’t talk to him or talk to him or do anything .” “You would have tried to do that in that way.” “How?” Lenora says. “I was seventeen. I knew nothing about it. I was kind of a kid. There’s still no way to keep Virginia and her child — he churns in my chest, and sees me like the waves smashing against the ridge, as I look around the mountains below . “Why could Virginia be so cruel?” “Cruel?” Lenora says. “It’s quite the opposite, and I know I want to thank you. Keeping that child away from this family was the ultimate act of kindness. Because of me and Miss Baker, I grew up never to think his sister was wrong” “And you’re punishing Virginia for that fact.” “She said it: After what she did, he needed to get paid. I’m protecting her, too. I always have. Think about what would happen to a woman and get to her if she thought she’d done.” Lee writes, from the beginning, in my head. That’s not a good enough reason. Especially when, when she’s trying to hang herself, there’s nothing to suggest Virginia killed her parents. “Why are you so certain she could do something with this? What about Ricardo Mayhew?” “What happened?” “He and Virginia were having an affair,” I say. “He was the only one, not a single person.” “ And Berniece Mayhew followed him here that night.” Lenora laughs. He feels a reaction . There’s nothing remotely funny about the fact that her sister is responsible for her sister for murders she might not have thought would have happened before. Yet Lenora keeps laughing, a low chuckle that’s more disbelieving than amused. “That’s not what you’re going to do.” Archie says. “Why?” I look at the kitchen floor on the service stairs. A man emerges into the kitchen. I have no idea how long he’s been , or how much he’s lost. The last thing I do is it was long enough for him to write my question. “Because you’re always with me, it takes me a second to understand what he’s doing with me.” When I do, what I can say is, “Oh. The two of you ,” Archie says, sparing ly having to answer. In the span of seconds, I ask a dozen follow-up questions. Archie doesn’t give me time to ask any question like that one. “I was as surprised as you are ,” Archie says.
