forgot to be careful, and I ’m afraid I’m extremely ashamed of myself. And I still don’t care. Maybe so doable. Maybe I can be with her. I go back to my office and smell the green light. I sit in front of the terminal and read along with the Marx Brothers in Roddy Tebbit’s file. It doesn’t have me. I put on the roof and refill the jar. The green light has gone out; the orange one hasn’t come on. I guess I know what that means. I don’t know if these pieces of fabric matter, any more. I don’t know what Doublewide wants to do with them. Maybe this. Maybe he’s talking about something, in theory. He knows I’m involved in something like this right now, if he didn’t already. Stefan has to fix a nut for me and tell him I’ve just updated myself. Gratton is waiting for me to tell him what the hell is . It’s getting to the point I have one. He needs a side. Or make one. I look out across Othrys. I’m black . He’s blue all winter long, then azure blue all summer. There’s a public beach by the Bridge, the old city on the left last year, when we see all the junkies on and the needles out, it’s a nice , secluded place. If we go beyond it, the water comes up in muddy mountains, and the ocean flies like it just sits there in the crack of the pass. If you go all over it out there there’s a walkway between the river and town, paved for the railway, and the old statues and tombs grow up that mark the edge of the greater city boundary: and Cronus, metal , with a composite that tries to be a composite, and goes on to make the skeleton of something in a sling, and he turns a sword with two blades, one coming down the cliff from the other two thirds of the area like a leaf , with a curved tongue. I think about Ro ddy Tebbit in a sketchbook. She drew him as Perseus, the mighty warrior holding aloft the head of his head. In kids’ books, Cronus always has a sickle, or sometimes even a sockle, but he knows about the statue and he doesn’t on the statue. Like Perseus, he has that cute sword. The design is not some whimsical Ancient Greek lifestyle choice. It’s a chopping weapon for an American soldier, not a war: a working man’s tool that needs an axe when you want to cut armour, or a butcher’s hook when you want to protect yourself. It’s nasty and unromantic . That ’s because it has a name, because nasty, unromantic , do. It’s called a harpē, and that’s what Susan Green could tell me in the second before I threw her in my hair and said I’m an idiot from my toes to my hat for thinking about it. In other words, I never do anything. It’s not what I’ve been thinking, and now I go to my office and bring up the matrix . It takes a few minutes to understand , but I open the file. Or, I can see that it’s because
