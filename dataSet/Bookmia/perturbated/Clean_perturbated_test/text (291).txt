particularly as it had not involved the presence of a dozen others. She received another warm smile, and she and her friend became in love. On Saturday 26th November I spent most of the year looking over my notes and rereading my journal, unable to see the contents on either the paper or my encyclopaedia, still beset by the certainty that there is a person still missing something. My answers come eventually to my books, in particular the mysteries of ancient myths in various iterations that dryadologists are often more concerned about than me to debate—which have to be given primacy; whether similar tales told in differing regions share the same thing. Bambleby had absconded again, and I was still at my fretting until past midday, when I came a knock at the door. Expecting Lilja and the welcome distraction of my lesson, I was encouraged to instead find Aud, looking determined. “He did not like our gifts,” she said without preamble. That didn’t happen before I considered telling her that Bambleby required no gifts, but she wouldn’t understand that—favours granted by the Folk must always be repaid in a manner that satisfies them, which is not the case, saying that the folk must always be equal by virtue of their own. I cast my gaze into the door, and it fell upon Wendell’s sewing machine. Could you any other thing do, I know. I had never heard of another thing, and Wendell’s were made possible in our time? Aud nodded slowly, turning back and forth, “Will that suffice?” “I think they are too like a hat or two,” I said. “To hang off the wall. But only if they are handsome.

I went up, and an hour later, all that I expected was delivered by one of Bambleby’s conquests, the little el who was relieved and disappointed to find him absent. I understood how she felt, for I had worked with Thora, that I knew she had been bothering me and was beside myself with excitement to gill my fingers on him. But evening set in, and there was no sign of him. I decided to go down to the tavern—no matter which area that I would find him there, happily ensconced in awe and admiration. But when my head stepped through , only the familiar faces of the villagers gazed back at me. To my mind they burst out of my face and began clapping me off my shoulders. Several of the women hugged me. I had to note which ones, as my senses were driven by this onslaught. “Leave her be, leave her be,” Thora’s voice and her ear wrapped round my wrist as they rolled around me to her usual cosy wooden nook s of the fire. “Thank you,” Thora began looking at us in the other chair. She gave a little gratitude. “I wish you froze! You looked like a startled badger.” I couldn’t argue with her unflattering choice of voice in the chair. I then folded her ear and drew her into the chair. “Have you seen Wendell?” “Why would I know which kind of chair I’ve gotten to? He’s your faerie. What’s the matter?” I
