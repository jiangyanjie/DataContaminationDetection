“Really?” “It will of course be about the next. What is her name?” “Angelina.” “Is she Black?” I nod and I try to mollify her instantly. “That is good.” “Ghanaian too. I think she’s even Christian,” I add. I obviously have no idea if she is the latter, but Mum looks pleased. “Maybe she can mentor you for your future career,” she says. “Mum, I work in publishing.” “And so? Can you not keep publishing open? Publishing doesn’t make you a lot of money, does it? How much does Kristine earn? Mum raises her eyebrow when a wide smile breaks out across her face. We continue to converse in writing before we ask me where I go wrong until I can repeat it correctly. “Try and find out Kristine’s salary.” “That will happen?” “I bet Angelina makes more.” “Maybe.” “Maame,” she says, for a while. “Yes, but do you think you will marry?” I say.
