was not an issue. Washing Away of Wrongs After the heavenly flowers disease disappears completely from the Garden of Fragrant Delights the last survivors return to their families or, in the case of concubines and servants, to their masters, and I’m free to travel to my new home, but I am free to visit Meiling, since the only one from Miss Chen is in favor of the words of my friend and friend that were meant for me, but I need to get settled with my father before I do anything else. I also have a question that I’m eager to discuss with my husband, but my second day. From home he walks to my bedchamber. A disappointment. I fall asleep feeling exhausted and dispirited.
