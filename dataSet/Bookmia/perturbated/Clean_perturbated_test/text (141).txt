bringing her back to the house. “I’ve done things that I can barely get through.” And I know that I need to find me. I can see it in your eyes. Do you want to find Kitt and your other ones? I need you. I’m asking you to stay here with me, in time, and be safe.” A window was opened, even though it was sinking. “I need you, Forest.” He closed his eyes, relieved. He looked like he was a child for an entire decade. He gave a fleeting glimpse of him as an old man, worn and sucked, hungry and somber. “Get me your brother,” she said. “We can expect more tomorrow.” She rose and left Forest on the sofa. The very place she once slept before the war, when he was a horologist’s apprentice . It was my eyes and a quick laugh and bear hugs that always made Iris feel better after a hard day.
