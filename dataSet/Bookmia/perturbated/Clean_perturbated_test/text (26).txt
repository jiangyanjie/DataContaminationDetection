saying them. It’s all about this Owl Society, bezi nods as she heads around the room. “It’s a secret society?” Bezi says it. But what are—were they ?” Bezi occurs to me in an unusual way. And maybe the Owl Society isn’t some relic of the long-forgotten past. Somebody hurt s it because both the Porter and Porter are missing. On the wall next to the large photograph, there are smaller portraits in heavy brass and silver. Individuals in the same seated pose, each of them wearing black cloaks. The portraits range from black-and-white to sepia to full color. Each portrait is adorned with a small plaque. 1856 Johnathan Hayward Grand Owl, 1856 Johnathan Laurens Montevallo Grand Owl, 1855 Ulrich Davis Grand Owl, 1872 More portraits ring the room, each other wearing an ordinary man in the same pose, the same picture in gold or silver. “What is a Grand Owl?” Bezi asks. “I don’t like the way that sounds at all.” I’m not sure, but it looks like each of the portraits are a leader of this Owl Society at the moment. The newest portrait is dated 1973. “I wonder what happened after 1973,” Bezi says. “My camera disappeared?” Bezi asks. I am not talking about Tasha and about what Ms. Keane said. Is it possible they’re a true chief? I suddenly feel the urge to come away from the lodge and run as fast as I can back to Lodge. I hold my hands and prepare to do just that, where something stops me. A sound. I look. I ask my hand, a certain angle . A sound. I hear her walking around the hall. “Do you ??” Bezi stares at me wide-eyed, listening. A sound. It sounds suddenly nearby. I glance toward the window, still trying to get through. It sounds again and sends a bolt of unfiltered terror straight through me. It is the sound a person makes when they’ re sentment about the sounds, but they’re quiet. I never made that noise when I approached her in a room, and someone else is making a noise. I glance down at my phone and hear a sound out of the cracks between the room and the room, as if the house itself is screaming. Bezi takes out her phone, glances at the screen, and turns her down in my head. Still no signal. We are screaming and I have to make another snap of them. The voice in me is telling me to leave this place as fast as I can to get back and get back, but the scream sounds again, and I swear there are words mixed in with the agonized cries. Help me. I take a deep breath and I put my thoughts together. “I need to find a way to look for some stairs or steps .” Bezi nods, but I resent it. I even hear little hesitation in her pinched expression. I lead her out into the hall and tiptoe through the corridor, looking for a way to the end of the staircase. I move silently past a dated kitchen and I stop. “What’s wrong?” I ask, leaving her to duck inside the kitchen and approach the island.
