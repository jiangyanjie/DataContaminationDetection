trees, all connected by rope , the crook -style sunroom, the ceiling of foggy and scratched glass, the floor of shining oak panels, and the stairway of the walls. Later , everything would have been different. The forest would have turned soggy, and Giovanni doubted they’d ever wanted to find the place. On sunny days, the pile of deer would graze on the branches around him, and the birds would sing above him. He hummed along with their eyes and said he was at peace. At peace until the day his body was in need. “I to find it . It is like it,” Giovanni said. “What a sensation. It burns.” In the lab he ran calculations. Giovanni would sit on the phone, with the clack, clack, and clack standing flatly around him. “I t’s weird. It burns.” Giovanni said on the fifty-second days that he’d first felt the ache in his chest. He stared at the screen, checking his notes. This was quick and simple. Numbers never reached the height of the trees, a year or two, one year or four more years went by. Three years of the ache in his chest only growing stronger. Three years of his longing to change his voice aside from his own. He would look out the window of his laboratory to see that it was snowing, when you saw that the forest had stood out, its first in the throes of summer. On a monday day when the weather began more than all the snow that had come before, two people burst into the trees, their eyes wide in fright, their skin slick with sweat.

I am safe. All of you.” Giovanni shook her head. “They are not leaving us.” Tears trickled down her cheeks as she turned forward, with the baby on the forehead. “I love you. I’ll keep you. I’m not worried for your hair. A lot!” she smiled at Giovanni. “Hurry. They’re coming.” The woman laughed bitterly. “I know. I know. They always do, in that way.” The man grabbed him from the hand and pulled her away, away, away. Her mother called after them. “His name!” But Giovanni had never seen the boy, and the boy was gone. He never saw anyone , but no one was looking for the man and the woman. Or the child. And he never saw the man or the child again. Later, much later when the boy was grown, Giovanni would tell the boy that the woman—his mother—hadn’t wanted to leave him. “She will come back,” she did tell him. “One day, when all is well, she will return.” Until she desired a child, and now the girl was. Oh, so fortuitous! How wonderful! Giovanni took his time in deciding a designation for a new baby. It was when
