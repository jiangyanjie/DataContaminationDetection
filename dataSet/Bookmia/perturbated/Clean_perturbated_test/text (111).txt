there was one bag lurking somewhere, Mrs. King wanted it to be free open. Mrs. Bone put her hands on the back, expression angelic. “Good Lord,” she said. “It’s not fair to wait for a date?” “Any day’s a time for a date?” “The time?” “No.” Mrs. King took the sherbet to the top of her chest. “The price?” Mrs. Bone shook her head. “No, you’re right. Not an inch on my Janes, mind you.” “I can’t change your fee.” “Can’t you?” Another grin on her shoulder, Mrs. King offered the bag. Mrs. Bone batted his hand away. “You’ve got her fingers.” She rummaged into an abysmal heap of pear s, sniffling out a fistful, blue egg in her mouth. “Go on.” “You go on.” Mrs. Bone stared at her, stepping her up to the point of sucking hard. “I have an advance.” “I want an advance.” “No, I’ve got someone like Danny’s coins that you stole . Not at no cost to me. A place bearing no value at all.” This place was a bit rich. “It doesn’t offer any value?” said Mrs. King. “Do you think of it rather carefully.” “These aren’t the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, my girl. We want to see the pyramids. I want symbols all over the walls. I don’t need gestures. You’re doing this whole thing about me to take credit. If I hadn’t talked with you, I’d say the same. But then I’ve got decent lines. You want to spend on my account, on my name, then I need cash up front, to cover my risks.” “Yes,” said Mrs. King, crunching her sherbet. “You do.” Mrs. Bone looked annoyed at her. “Look at him. But then, you understand, don’t you me,” she said. “I love making big investments when trading gets a kickstart.” Second move, thought Mrs. King. “Your trade’s not about to get any brisker,” she said. Mrs. Bone took another step. “I can’t. “I’ve got eyes.” “And?” “I can read accounts.” As the first move , she climbed the long streak of “Smile.” “If I can keep you, didn’t I? thought Mrs. King. She felt almost sorry, prodding Mrs. Bone. She was the only one ever kept an eye on her when she was small. Gave her clean pinafores, reacted to fresh stockings, when Mother couldn’t manage. But this wasn’t a good one, and she should . “Not your trade.” Mrs. King added smoothly. “I never pry into a good time.” But I keep a call on Mr. Murphy. His books are looking splendid, like you come with orders. Whereas the best smell around your patch is a pile of old debts.” “Is the future too late?” Mrs. King nodded. “Debts and debtors, crawling all over your patch.” Mrs. Bone said. The flesh of the patch was also taut, as if she were holding her breath with great effort, as if it were costing her dearly not to . But there was nothing to say King. Now she mastered herself. Smiled, put the other pear drop into her mouth. “Shall I name the sum dear? Or will I bully each other till sundown?” Mrs. King crossed her arms. “You may name the sum.” Mrs. Bone did so.
