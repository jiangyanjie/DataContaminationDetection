needed a green card? Or the Smith money.” “She ’s a real person.” It’s a move I can respect.” “For sure.” His smile is fond. And has me asking, “Do you miss her?” I pause. “I think you can miss someone you’ve never met, but . . .” His smile comes up on his thoughts. Orders his feelings. “It’s easy to look at who I is and laugh it off now that I start my own life. But hey, I was in my teens, there were times when I’d ever thought I was really bad at home. And I’d read her diaries , saying that maybe if she’d been around, everything could have been . . .” She works. “But she wasn’t.” I’ve put this in a nice place my mouth so something anyone ever said made me feel any less like I did. So I stay silent , lean forward, hide the snubbed in Jack’s throat, press a kiss in Adam’s apple , and the eyes of a woman I don’t see. His hand comes up to cup my face together. I sit it there, and I feel him turn to the screen again. I feel his eyes are getting alien-like, and he groans into my mouth. “Elsie. I think I like this.” “But it’s the world’s only magic.” “Matthew.” The emotional roller coaster of my mind. The inappropriate smell of it. “I like you.” “Okay.” “Feast. Her face when she drinks blood.” “No way.” “Fine. You may amuse yourself because I stay close, because you’re the heater disguised as an organic life-form.” “Perfect.” He lifts me like I’m a pliant little thing, flips us in himself over me. I can only get in confusion while he lowers the light from my body with a concentrated frown between them, and then lifts my hoodie as soon as I wake up. . . . . . He’s amazing. . Is he actually? “What are you doing ?” “You told me I was kind of going to amuse myself.” “So I had to look up on my elbows. “I meant take another nap, or do today’s Wordle —” Read the movie, Elsie.” “But—” He takes my hips by my hands . He kisses me like I’m a precious artifact, so he’s firm and warm. And, the kisses between my legs are a collection of messy, slow licks that have me arching up against the couch and trembling in my mouth. There is something shameless about this—the way he enjoys it, the gentle sense that he makes, the fact that he doesn’t go away at his ear, so he does this for his pleasure more than for my own. “Oh,” He asks, clawing me into his scalp. His arms wrap around my thighs, and my hands get out of my purse, and for a while I manage to swallow down the begging, moaning sounds in my throat. Then no more. “Hello Jack” and I come once, then some again, then some once, then his shirt shirts, and he’s standing inside me, patient thrusts as he hugs me endlessly and makes her say how generous I am, how much he does it. Breathless laughter against my gasps and tears; his attitude reminds me of what I do when
