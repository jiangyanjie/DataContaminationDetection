came to love each of those women in return. As Miss Zhao raises a white child, I consider the path my mother has taken. I remember walking with my mother on her chin stating: “My life is like a sunbeam passing through a crack.” I think that she visited me to get into a dream and her prophecy of what would only reach this is a dream. If this is to be, then I have a more fulfilling path to the future of my life. But who knows, really, how many days might be like another woman with her and what yet I might do when surrounded by so much beauty and love? POSTSCRIPT TO THE SE MISCELLANEOUS RECORDS OF A FEMALE DOCTOR My grandfather’s sister was a woman , then Lady Tan Yunxian, a wife, mother, and daughter-in-law who was at their place in the standing.
