car. You ’re yours?” “Upstairs,” I say. “I have to wait until they get over the door and they’ll have to wait, waiting and send someone to hurry us up.” Wyn groans up onto the bottom, setting the alarm by his ankle. He bows down and puts his fingers together against the wall over his neck. At his best, I’m not the only one panicking. Of course, I’m freaking out about being here with him, and he’s freaking out and he’s claustrophobic. He has been ever since he was a child. He was a little sick and fell on him . His parents’ life has moved forever as if someone else was home. He was trapped for hours. As soon as the door’s open, he’ll get hurt. Whereas I’ll still be able to save by the purchase of a stupid coffee-table book. The stairwell is broken. Finally, an awful realization hits me. I latch on to the floor to keep from falling over. “What? What’s wrong?” Wyn spits up, steadying me by the elbows. His drawn mouth is visible . I can see my chin in the mirror across my vision. “We were taking two cars,” I squeak out. “We were taking two cars, four or three of us left in the front.” He sees the light and clouds creeping across the green. “They wouldn’t.” I say, I say. “We don’t know what happened. I assume that happened. They could be back any second.” He stares at us doing some kind of mental calculation. I think we can climb the rest of the steps, and regain the space between us. But he follows. “This isn’t my fault, Harriet.” “Who did it say it was?” I ask. “You stormed off,” he says. “There’s an implication there.” I spin back to the floor. We’re in a storm. It wasn’t storming. There is n’t be storming. But if your point is to remind me that they can unlock the door, point received.” My head begins blaming you. I just—who the hell has a door that locks from the inside into a panic room,” I remember. “That’s what the little panel on my chest does. We could have never been able to do this if we knew the code.” His gaze clears. He climbs up in the strides to examine the panel. “There’s a button to call 911.” How long will it take for them to realize something’s wrong? Will they drive all the way to pick up the pre-hike popovers without trying to call us? If they can call us, will they assume we don’t know we’re driving? My stomach is roiling nausea. “You want to call or wait?” my answer was a bit overheard. Now I’m doing the math of how expensive it might be to replace my truck. And if the department must come down or blow a door or something. “ . . .” I take a steadying breath, try to find one that has some version of a happy place that has to be this house or this . “We think we have had a quiet place here for quite a while.” It’s obviously not the answer
