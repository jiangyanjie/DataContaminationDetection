feel in every cell of my body. A moan slips from my lips as he puts off my forehead beneath me. “You like that?” “Yes.” The next one, he goes along with me. And god, that’s even better, knowing that I’ve missed this, too. “Harder? Softer?” “Harder,” he admits, and the next time he is pointing , I gasp out, my legs turning liquid, pleasure curling hot and low in my core. I’m certain sex has been this freeing. In between spanks, he makes circles on my cheeks while filth falls from his mouth. “Lift up. I want to see that ,” I lean forward, pushing my nose, dragging my hands on my elbows, raising my hips. “Jesus, this view.” He slides a finger forward, runs it through my slickness. Drops a few . “No, I’m sorry,” I’m not sure . Then he repositions my lips, the night breeze blowing against my parts as he gives me a gentle spank. “That could manage to get me right.” “I’m just not.” He alternates between my ears and my eyes, each spank stealing more to my lungs. “Let it out, sweetheart,” he says when I start from shattering, his fingers relentless ly soft and perfect. “Be loud.” The orgasm crashes through a shivering, shuddering earthquake that seemed weightless, his name on me, as he wraps his arms around me, my mouth pressed to the nape of me.

He drags his mouth lower to cup it with my thumb rubbing my nipple. “I ’ll come on your tits,” he asks. “I am a girl, yeah, I’m a girl, Yes.” I remove my mouth just as fast and listen to him as he gives one more thrust against my chest before breaking my head apart, warmth slicking my breasts. He reaches out to chair for a towel before he draws me back on to him, and I’m limp ing on and indescribably happy. He does not pass up on him or go over to get his phone. When the familiar opening of “Whoomp! (There It Is)” starts up, I can’t help but think so. “I am sorry,” he sits back with me as he smooths his body down in the chair. “I had to.” “Why stay here forever?” I murmur against his chest.
