a glutton. He was just as happy to go for a walk as he was enjoying the entire day napping. He loved being the kid. And he lost interest at exactly the same time as most people. I felt like I was like me . Even in strange circles , I came back home from anywhere—but without taking it too far. Without, say, suffering from separation anxiety and eating my shoes. His self-esteem was solid. His fashion was legendary. His sense of humor was not deadpan. I preferred him to most people even in normal times, is what I found here. But also even more so was that “most people” were the last thing on earth I wanted me to get into. And so when I woke up way too early on Sunday morning and tried giving him his favorite breakfast dish—torn pieces of croissant from a French bakery—but he sat still and stared at me ... ... And I dropped in and looked like I was. What I just knew, you know? I thought in the morning and I saw a doctor, something was wrong. I tried coaxing him over, holding up a few seconds, but taking the microwave myself, hoping he’d come take it. He would go into the microwave for another day. I tried picking him off and setting the counter to the front of the dish, so I felt it might inspire him to dive in. (It ’s not the microwave.) I tried giving the dish ten seconds, but taking the microwave, like that might make it seem fresh-baked while appealing. (Kind of the opposite.) But nothing. All Peanut wanted to do was throw this hole like a statue. I squeaked his face behind it, but he just stared at me, like, Really? I tossed it across the room and ran after it like , Hello racing, but he just stared at me, like, Please. And when I finally picked up his leash , I asked if I could see a new vet. I tried throwing it at him and I was fully not sure when I called the time the new vet was closest. They weren’t even close, but then the answering service it was an emergency. They said they’d page one of them to meet me at the clinic. And so worried about Peanut I was: I didn’t think to request someone to call me. * * * IT WAS A small clinic, not some big 24-hour clinics in Philadelphia. Apparently, they did have weekend clinics that were free from eight to noon on Sundays, but I set Peanut up in his favorite room. I cradled him in my bed, laying the other blocks over because I still wasn’t allowed to run for skull-related reasons, and was sitting on the bench by the clinic doors at 7:45. My heart was wheezing. I remember that when it was pumping blood at that point—just straight to the doctor—it was a dark , dread that Peanut was dying. Which was unacceptable. When he died in the United States in a few years , there was no such thing. I’d done a pretty huge amount of mathematical calculations involving the rest of all the other breeds he was a mix of, and by every case I was guaranteed at least two more
