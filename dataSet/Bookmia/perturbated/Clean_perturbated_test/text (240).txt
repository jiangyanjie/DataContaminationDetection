people care that they hear. “We’re so close. This is this,” they walked down. “If Martinek is set on planting another bomb tomorrow, there’s no time to waste,” said Marion. “We have to figure out another plan, try to catch him in the act.” “The n they ask us?” Peter looked at the other end, and as they got right , though she was certain they did, it meant that she knew they shared the blame in forming him that the police knew they had already a plan for not telling the documents to the police when he took over the bomb. She got the thought. Turning in the bomber meant turning in her father. But if they waited for the police to listen to their senses and listen , Mr. Peter had realized it would give the bomber the choice to set out another bomb to kill or injure more people. “I have a plan,” said Marion finally. “I know what you can do.” * No, Marion couldn’t go back to work and look Simon in the eye, knowing what he and his fellow employees Steve Power had done.
