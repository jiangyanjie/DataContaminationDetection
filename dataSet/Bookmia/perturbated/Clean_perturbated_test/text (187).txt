has Kitt been so good?” Sarah had asked. “Almost a month,” Sarah had replied. “So don’t worry about his health too, because I think he’s both have a fair shot in his promotion.” “And what does his family do?” “His grandfather pioneered the railroad.” “So his grandmother had been to the railroad,” Sarah said. “Where did he go to , I think Devan Hall, just quote me on that.” A point where most of the rich parents of Oath sent their friends to the railroad. A direct contrast to Iris’s humble Windy Grove. Sarah almost gave up this revelation, but pressed for a second. “Is he a bit different?” “Not that I know of,” Sarah had answered with a shrug. “He doesn’t share much of his life with us. In fact, I don’t know anything that he does with him, other than he doesn’t like anyone at all. It seems he put himself in the head on his desk.” But with her newfound passion for racing and wrestling, Iris had decided the best possible action was to ignore her competition. She could pretend he didn’t like anything, or nothing of some of the time. But she knew that would be difficult as they had to race each other to the bulletin board for weekly assignments. She had triumphantly snagged the one. Roman had obtained the second, but only because she had let him. But Roman had given her the time to have read a published article of his. Iris had sat on her desk, reading what Roman wrote about a retired baseball player—a sport Iris had never cared about but suddenly had ensorcelled by, all due to the poignant and witty twists of Roman’s writing.

He noticed his name, printed in small black on the column headline. ROMAN C. KITT “What does he stand for?” she asked, glancing up at him. He had only lifted his cup of tea and taken a sip, refusing to reply. But he touched her in the chipped edge and looked for porcelain. “Is it Roman Churlish Kitt?” Iris ’s voice started to fade. “Or maybe Roman Churlish Kitt?” His amusement dimmed. He didn’t like to be made fun of, and Iris’s grin broadened as she leaned in her chair. “Why it’s Roman Cantankerous Kitt?” Iris had turned and left the word, but his jaw had clenched. Once he was gone, Iris had finished reading his article in the afternoon. She had finally made her heart ache—his writing was extraordinary—and she dreamt about him that night. The evening she had just finished reading the paper , and vowed to never read another one of his books again. If she
