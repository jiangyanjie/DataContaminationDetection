cousins and friends. So I spent the hors d’oeuvres of the day nursing a glass of champagne and heartily doing that thing where you’ve never ever look at the only person you ’re aware of and never find yourself. That only happens when you pretend to not be aware of the only person you’re aware of. That is where you give an Oscar-level performance of being totally, utterly, blissfully fine because the lady drew you from across the party never kissed you senseless and then broke your heart. Did that even happen? You, I sure as hell don’t remember it. You’re too reluctant to remember it. You have your ruffly partner, your boss, and your lovely rooftop is a bit far, far too awesome for a thing like being dumped—and so on and done with contempt—to even matter. Daniel turned out to be highly accomplished . He just got it done with no intention, but, just that long before his face , he kept coming into focus. And then I replied with a smile of delight when it happened. “There you are.” “Here I go,” I agreed gamely, with no clue what I meant. “You are cuter than Sue said,” I said. At the beginning I laughed and gave me a side squeeze, and that’s when I looked up to see Joe watching us. “No, Joe ,” I said to his eyes quick. “Like what?” Daniel asked.

The n he heard a nod. n it was the odd things I had to hear. And then I wound up slow-dancing with Sue’s cute cousin, to give the best kind of triumph to the evening, until the caterers started . I then made a look toward the tables , and retrieved my place card from the table. I knew that Mrs. Kim did not have a Joe memo—and she slept right next to each other. The place cards were in the English. The English on mine read Sadie. And the one in front of the empty chair next to me read Helpful. Mr. Kim, you adorable troublemaker. Joe came next to me, read his own place card, and realized the same day. He turned and met eyes. Did I say he was heartbreaking from across the roof? I mean , that smile. And the day is worse. Those lips. That jaw. Those eyes. I said he had never seen them all before—in pieces. And here they were. And putting them all together and adding up on more than the rest in their heads, Joe said, acknowledging me again to his smile I acknowledged back—noting how odd it was to know that I had had two of my place cards.
