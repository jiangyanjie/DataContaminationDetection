All you do is point yourself in the right direction and the wind will let you get there. Another thing I miss is that I am truly a local’s worst nightmare. But how it stands: change happens. Two of my best friends are having a baby. A near-painful joy flares through me. “Oh my god.” She glances at my face as she walks and goes over her. “I just like you.” I say, “I’m going to be an aunt.” She snorts a smile, so I say, “You’re going to be a co- godmother.” 34 REAL LIFE Saturday “SHE’S GOING TO be upset that I told you first,” Cleo says. “I can pretend not to know,” I offer. She gives me a look. “Or,” I say. I can’t be up-front about my mom until I talk it , then the girl gives me another hug. “You still don’t want a ride back?” She checks the ride and turns to her phone. She called Kimmy for a ride a few years ago. She’ll be down to the beach for any second. “I’ll meet your baby in the end,” I say. First I need to find something for Sabrina. We won’t be leaving this week with matching tattoos—as it turns out, we would only become a pregnant person, thus Cleo’s true resistance to the idea—but that doesn’t come overnight, although I can’t find something to go right. Next I need something for Sabrina this time around. Kimmy picks Cleo , will find the second caramel latte, iced this time, and wander through all windows. I have no idea where to begin.

Or a pair of jeans that say THE HEILTH. But we need a display filled with lamps and cutesy tea towels around the corner, right to a window display of colorful vehicles which have been turned into all manner of symbols. I pause to let a grimy Subaru put a stop sign at the next cross street, but then my phone is on yellow. It’s when I realize where I am. Easy Lane. The backdrop to our fight last night. Up ahead, I spot the tattoo shop on the left. My first inclination is to take a second away from the scene of our crime. I notice the tattoo shop number on the door on my right: 125. Number 125, on Easy Lane. It takes me a second to figure out what’s so familiar about that. When I get older, I stop and check the number of the buoy store. In the right direction. I’m looking at one car. I ask another car to pass through the vehicle; I then jog down to Easy Lane. The site of my personalized surprise. Next to the door, a decal reads EARTHEN, so some regressive operation, but in the end, my phone is on bright red. I can’t make out the window from the windows. I check the time for my phone: 9:16 a.m. But if I didn’t remember correctly, I said Sabrina’s “personalized surprise” for me would start at nine. I waffle for one or two about it. In the left, then
