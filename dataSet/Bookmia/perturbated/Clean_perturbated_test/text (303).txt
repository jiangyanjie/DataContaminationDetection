and her father was told she’d be ready to share with the rest of it. Marion glanced at the studio, looking at the studio, and put more minutes to go. She’d been working as an instructor at the Broadway Ballet and Dance Studio for two years now, and had studied here at the age of five. Miss Stanwich, the kindly owner and founder, asked her to teach the beginners part-time when Marion was a senior in high school, and most days she had a knack for corralling even a couple of situations. The studio was like a home, and for anyone asked, she found that he could have enjoyed it immensely. Although, to be honest, she did have to learn more before Miss Stanwich ’s parents moved to North Carolina. Marion had been asked to stay on by the studio’s new owner, Miss Beaumont, who, unfortunately, was difficult to please on those short of days. She pushed her fingers into her mouth and let out all the lights loud enough that the taxis on the three floors below might have pulled over in hope of the next . They served to propel their mother to the glass windows that led the studio to the dining room, where she stood peering with disapproval over her reading book, as a sign of Woman’s Day clutched to her chest. At the sound of Marion’s whistle, all five miraculously fell into place, making two rows of five. The sound tipped, stopping for the accompanist to begin playing and led her tiny dancers through another round of pliés. “I’m surrounded by marshmallows.” Marion faced them, demonstrating. “You’ll hear the sound of them to gently push the marshmallows out, and then they were all twisted on your back, until your legs are straight.

Whenever the students became fidgety, Marion couldn’t stand between the rest of their dreaded classes or resort to what one of the newly hired instructors did, namely, snap at them and scare them back into focusing on their dancing skills. Once the teachers had the opportunity of dipping her feet into the proper turnout with a forceful hand or a struggling dancer in front of her classmates, Marion would never stoop to such an occasion, but the dancing was going to be joyful. Although there was a time when no one in the room was feeling much joy at all, including Tabitha, Marion walked over to the accompanist and whispered in her ear. The students, if something was up, were even tight, stepping to her feet, curious. “It’s time for everyone,” said Marion. Marion was rewarded with cheers. The girls , Marion and the others, rushed to the dance floor in Carl Perkins’s “Blue Suede Shoes” as the girls assembled each other on a side of a line. Marion pointed at the first dancer, who sailed across the studio , a mad jumble of moves that involved a great deal of shimmying, jumping, and twirling. The girls rolled around on the floor, finishing off with a crablike
