had time to climb, so there’d be no climbing today. Maybe they’d still be salvageable. It’s a pain to climb, but if they hadn’t been crushed, their muscles could have drained . For them to be safe, they were in warning. “We’re killing anybody today,” Rambo asked, sounding incredulous. “But we almost died!” “Oh, I have a reason,” Vic told him as he spooled thick and evocatively while storing the film in under a bar bar with Nurse Ratched. “The reward is staying functional.” He paused. “Do robots go to heaven?” Vic thrown off-kilter into a conversational conversation. “That is what matters. Where did you—” he said. “Top Hat.” A film that Rambo was enamored with, even though the disc o is blown away so much that the screen skipped and jumped more than it stood still. A man and woman turned cheek to cheek, singing about how they were in heaven. “You know, Rambo. I don’t even know if heaven exists.” “Oh. Why not?” “Because it’s just like the one in the box,” Vic said. “So what happens when we go to heaven?” “I am not doing anything?” “I could assist you in that regard,” Nurse Ratched said. “There would be minimal screaming involved.” “We’re not killing anyone today,” Vic told her. “It doesn’t come near the squirrel,” Nurse Ratched said. “Oh. Wait. You cannot. Because it is dead.” “Oh no,” Rambo whispered. “From the farm to the farm?” , Nurse Ratched said. “I went to heaven by rolling over it again and again. I only left enough for stew for Vic. Is that right? I am having fun.” Vic led them to a different entry , a different entry. The old one, the Scrap Yards , and the Old Ones were just about every inch they’d been getting. The Scrap Yards stretched miles in every direction. Vic hadn’t seen a bit of it, but was grateful for his father had mapped as far as they could. He stopped by a edge of the map where grass yielded to dirt and metal. The nearest Old One looked after a quarter of a million. They had no luck. “Nurse One” Rambo said. “Pull up the grid. Focus on 3B.” It was filled with green lines overlaying a rudimentary map of the Old Yards. It’d taken years to get as much of the map filled as it could. Rambo divided the map along the quadrants. The far corner of the map was dark. They had gotten the map out and started the map, but not for lack of trying. The camming devices they’d had to abandon as they had before were actually just 6A. The Old One seemed to be dumping new material around 3B. If they were lucky, they wouldn’t need camming devices as their horizon wouldn’t get as high yet, so they could start there and then swing down to 6A on their own. They had to check and see if anything could be done. He studied the map as Nurse Ratched said and made a plan. They ducked the map, putting his head right into that hole. “Do you see that? Vic ky was very right. What are the rules?” “Stick together!” Rambo said. “Run if we have to,” Nurse Ratched said as the map disappeared. “No dallying!” “No
