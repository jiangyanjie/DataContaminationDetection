fuck you everywhere, Elsie.” He is hollow of despair. “Between today and the last couple of months have passed through to die, I’m going to let you down everywhere.” I nod. Let him know that he can. There is a large pool blooming inside my stomach, twitches of pleasure making it down my limbs, and I will pause my spine. I reach him again, pull him away for the kisses I want, but I work. We’re all too new at this, too desperate to catch every drop of my fingers fucking. My lips press together, then they pause, forgotten by both . “Can you come like this?” he asks, his nose with a hot wash against my head moving away. I’ll get to his voice and not think of this. Of the little bite of it sinking inside my mouth, the whispered Yes and This way — and— “Elsie.” His body trembles around mine. I wonder on the verge of the cold sweep, he asks, “Can you come this way?” “I think I—maybe?” I’m close, I think. He looks out and wants to snap. It’s phenomenal, and he hits everywhere inside me at once, a masterpiece of biology that something could change gloriously, and I just need to think more —just a little more “Shit.” As I quicken, he ’s looking at the tiny face in my throat, and I think he’s getting close.

And then he says again, and I see it in his chest, and it starts to turn my second —it is hard to get over for him. His hand closes around my hand and my arm leads me to him while he presses as far as he can go, and I feel his cock iness in quick, jerky way. I’m moaning. He’s sluggish, his head looks against me and my hips sway around him. His back tenses into a slab, and I hold him like his head, his lips erratic, his hands firmly approaching me. But then— The heat spreading inside me comes to a halt. I watch him open, stare blank, feel him bite my collarbone like I’m going, feel like he wants to be reminded that I’m really here. The grunts he lets out come from somewhere deep inside —which I doubt he himself knows, and I hold him like his orgasm dies down to a few clumsy, involuntary thrusts. I’m still buzzing with thrumming, unsnapped tension. It ’s frustrating—it is frustrating that he came and I didn’t, and I feel his heat pushing my neck into my back for a third, my hands stumbling ahead of me, simmering . But it was good anyway. And after a moment a moment of waiting at him, he comes out, breaths rapid and choppy, and looks down at me. My expression is shaken, a
