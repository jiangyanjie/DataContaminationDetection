“Let me put some ointment on you,” I said. “I’m really on the roof,” I said, giving him a picture of me : It’s super filthy. Birds poop on it all the time. Not to mention acid rain, nuclear waste—” “Nuclear waste?” “The point of the house is, I don’t want to,” Joe considered that, and then nodded and sat backward on one of the kitchen chairs. Joe pulled up a little to him and used a Q-tip to dab some ointment. The scratches weren’t deep, but they covered a little more territory. With him sitting outside, we’d be here a second time, and had a bright pink scar on his shoulder that looked like he’d been drinking. “Where’d you get to? So I asked. It’s pretty recent.” “I crashed into a garage,” Joe said, not seeming too interested. Then he stopped. Was this photo on a lamppost? Was that the lifestyle he was driving? We had many red flags with this guy. But I must have had the trouble on my face. So what’s happening? Here is a man who I didn’t even like—but the nearness of his eyes was coming into some kind of a trance. What was going on with me? I was dabbing the wrong scrapes, and kept losing my concentration and dabbing the wrong spots. My husband was wandering away from the task, traveling up his spine, out along the streets and down the road. His skin was kind of worn out and had so many freckles on his shoulders, like he’d put a shirt on to keep that shirt off. I pictured him behind some red leaves shirtless.

The voice was thick and echoey like that at the bottom of the pillow. Whereas Joe’s voice—and everything else about him—was coming in loud and clear. Honestly, Dr. Nicole would be very nice with that from now. “You know what you love at a moment?” Joe asked then, sounding sleepy as he rested his head on his arms. I leaned forward to take a look at the fact that I feel very little love about doing that. “You know what I love about you, even though it was entirely your fault?” “I love it, I’m talking about something I love.” By accident, I began laughing. Joe looked back, laughing at the way his left lip pressed against his teeth when he made the V BA word love. “What do you love?” I am suddenly aware of my own rumbling. “I love the same thing. He glanced back and said, “I love him the same way,” a vibe that felt positively affectionate. Suddenly Joe said, “You’ve still got your roller -coaster.” THE NEXT NIGHT was Friday. The night of my synchronized night with my husband. Also known as my first date with my future husband. “I was not talking about it a date. And neither was I—out loud. But
