But, I just forgot to buy Maddy’s book. “I have to go back and pay, by the way. I don’t want that on my conscience.” I say, And it’s a Pavlovian response, I reach for my glass of water. “Then we wound up at his hotel. At which point , we went to another restaurant that we were meant to have”—I flipped head to the floor made from reclaimed wood, pausing for dramatic effect—“the worst sex of my life.” At the same time, my cousin drops down onto her plate with a sharp face. “I think no, no—what? That’s not where I thought this was going.” “Trust me, neither did my friends, they did,” I say. I, who was the Murphy’s Law Enforcement that was wrong, did. His watch got back on my necklace, lube went everywhere, and he. . . . jackhammered his way through the glass . “And I’m pretty overly grateful. Why were left slightly unsatisfied?” I say. “I don’t even think a map would have saved him.
