that the conversation didn’t bode well, but that may mean that the new Rockettes have a hard time adjusting to your dance style. The restrictions of this style may be intimidating, which can feel stifling for some. You’re a terrific dancer, don’t get me wrong, you ’re a good person to stand out from the crowd. I think you know what I’m talking about.” “I know I’m getting more notes than any of the other dancers. But I was a bit concerned for letting me know what I’m going to be, and what you do.” If she lost this job, she would need to completely start over: the only person who would send her out would try to recruit dancers and directors. She’d begged her fans of her fellow residents at the Rehearsal , coming through the cycle of audition and rejection to know that she had enough serious resilience to tread the streets of Broadway.
