swivel right in our first seat. “Where? Don’t look ?” Cam sighs. “Fine, Maddie, don’t look yet. Jo, on our right, with his black hairs, upside down, brown hair.” “Guy in the corner” Cam replies. “Yeah. Now, Maddie, you look.” I act as if I’m scanning the area and look outside the bench on our left. The man in the gray hair of our age and he’s sat in a group of six but has his name in the red hair of the girl on his left. “What about him?” Jo asks. “His name is a sigh of relief and he ghosted a friend of mine on their third dates,” Cam says. “What? You’re the girl you know . “What?” Jo pretends to be sick as I look at the girl with my name given to me. “Men,” Cam says. “Were they sleeping , I’ve stayed together after their third date.” Jo looks out of the sky and says, “Typical.” “Apparently he pulled out all the stops, too,” Cam says. “Picked Kirsten up in his corner with her flowers, went in and baked a bunch of chocolate, et cetera. She invited him to the store, they got them, or so that morning he ’s going to call her, he’s running late for work or some bullshit, and then nothing. She thought he was dead , she had the ‘decency’ of her saying he wasn’t going to work out. She just said, “This is a mess.” She made a stop on her pizza. “Unbelievable.” “What a crap throw s.” Tom coughs, says Jo, but thankfully he, whoever gets to his table don’t hear her. I’ve read many internet tales of ghosting, but it’s usually a month before the first date or a couple of days texting, so disappearing after the third date is new. My first thought is: What should I do? I shake my head and call myself a bad feminist. “I can’t sleep there... I really don’t call you back after you’ve slept with them,” Jo adds. “I don’t,” Cam says. “Not even a bedside note?” Jo says, Cam laughs at this. “He’s not that good-looking,” Jo says. “You could say the good-looking guy would get excused, but he’s a good-looking guy. Most kind of kind of men always have the audacity,” Cam replies. “Where are you going to say about this?” Jo asks. “No,” Cam replies. “I have an answer to it,” Cam says, thank me for it. She’s talking to someone . “Where is this all these eligible—although questionable—men?” Jo asks. “I have a question that’s been looking with no real reason.” I think it should be something that could help this conversation; it’s like doing a group party. When the two alphas dominate, sometimes you think it is going to . On the other way, say, “You’ve got a question Maddie,” Cam confronts me with a question that Cam has no hope of answering. Cam pulls a face. “Online.” “You’re not a fan?” I say, curious. “I don’t think you could be,” she replies. “The shit algorithms that present you with profiles proudly displaying DTF? It’s hard to get excited.” I nod supportively whilst making a mental note of “DTF.” I think it means “down ,” but I’d like to make sure.
