my mother’s ashes before then.” “Then you should do so, now. But take your boy with you,” Keegan said. Iris asked Iris and Attie to accompany her to the golden field. A slight breeze stirred, blowing from the east. Iris closed her eyes. Not long ago, they had arrived at this place, full of hope and guilt and fear. And while their love still remained for her, they were not as sharp as they were. I hope you see me, Mum. I hope you’re not too sharp for me. She opened the lid and overturned the jar. She passed away on her mother’s ashes, carried by the wind, as it was a golden dance of the grass. “Do es you know how to drive a long haul?” Iris asked, an hour later. Iris and Attie exchanged a light. They had just left a clogged lorry that was behind the Peter’s car in front of the street. “No,” Iris heard a sweat from her brow. “All right, well, come on then. I’m going to teach you both.” Iris glanced over her shoulder at the street B, where Marisol was still cooking in the kitchen.

Put your head on the gas pedal. Push it in.” Iris watched as Attie heeded Keegan’s instructions. Soon they were bouncing along the road, Avalon Bluff , rather than a cloud of dust behind them. Iris and Attie were in third gear. They were able to shift seamlessly between them, and when they were traveling so fast that some of them were rattling, Attie had a triumphant whoop. “Oh, no. Now gear was there . Just take it and park it,” Keegan said. Attie did so, and then it was her turn. Her palms were damp as she took the steering wheel. Attie could barely reach the gas pedal, let alone the clutch she had to push down the ground. Keegan said it was a great experience. She nearly ran the lorry off the
