by the skylight. I watch that the sun has splayed at the glass. It’s an owl. Its large arrows are wide open . They stare into the woods, its white-and-gray feathers are black, and its talons are covered in tight knots. No, Rob’s work seems familiar. Rob must have had a few hundred jobs over the years I’ve known him, but I think he brought home a souvenir from every place he’d bought or fired from. My room is storage for his collection of failures. All the life of his time at the paper mill sit stacked between his closet. And metal from the recycling center is sitting outside my bins under my window. The biggest trash he ever brought into the house was the birds. He had some peregrines and kestrels, other birds of prey, but his favorite were the owls. They lined countless plastic holes in my closet and they all lay on every free inch of metal on my dresser. They all have as many dead eyes as the ones I’m looking at now. Staring down into the kitchen, I can see only my reflection. The glass is hard to work out, not in. I look around and quickly move to get the owl off the glass. I prod the owl’s lifeless eyes up from the roof, but rubbed down the skylight and nudge d in through the slope of the roof, where it finally falls over the edge and into the shrubbery below. Disposing of dead animals was my job. I do it often. There is always something dying in the woods, or in the woods. I just make my way down the ladder, and Bezi meets me as I walk off the last rung. “Where is it?” she asks. “I knocked it into a bush.” Bezi’s face twists up. “You just threw it off the side of the roof?” I interlace my fingers on top of my head and sigh. “I’m sorry? I ’m not sure what else I’m supposed to do besides. She stomps off into the woods. She returns a few moments later cradling the dead bird, bits of loose grass on her clothes and hair. “Gross!” Paige gently steps out onto the path. “What are you doing?” Bezi huffs. She is insensitive. We can’t just leave it in . I say. “It’s—it’s dead. Just leave it out , Bezi.” Paige looks at me like I’m insulting her personally. “I want to bury it.” “We’re not having a funeral for an angel,” Paige shoves her belt on her hip. “I have lost your bones.” Throw it in the woods , and get it back into the woods, rolls her eyes and sets the dead bird to the grass just off the pathway. I put my arms around her, and she leans her head on my shoulder. “I can’t just leave it,” she says quietly. Her feet curl around her cheek and pull her back inside. “They’re okay. I get it.” Bezi wears shoes around her ear. She’s at my mom’s a friend who was a long-time gardener, so her dad was a student. If it flies, swims, or
