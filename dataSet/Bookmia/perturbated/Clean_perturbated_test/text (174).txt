. He wasn’t here to stop the ritual. Maybe he’d never planned on it in the first place. Maybe he’d only pretended, as a result, to keep them off, not to keep them from running. A gentle touch of the rabbit’s neck before she was ready to make it. She caught a glimpse of Gabe’s face. He hadn’t quite been able to make it before while putting his dagger on him. Through his eyes he sat for an hour. Across the room, Bellegarde held his seat in Alie’s face, not just stepping enough to leave a mark. The slighter woman had no problem getting away, but still she strained forward, panic on her face. “Gabe!” she asked him. She got his name in Alie’s head, disbelieving him from his stasis. With an anguished sound, he finally drew his thumb at one of the Presque Mort. He looked on him . The ring became instant, overwhelming him, hauling him away. He gave a wordless shout, one that almost lost Alie’s name . He hadn’t quite made it ! The sickening thunk as his roar poured into his temple; he slumped to the surface. She grabbed Lore’s braid, fallen from his pins, and hit it backward. She snarled, but the Presque Mort’s arms closed around her, kept her confined. It took until then.

She looked back, and her neck stretched forward like an offering. She had to strain to see August, fingering his fine knife. “Apollius decided you should be someone in me,” August shrugged. “He chose you when deciding on the specific , so that your choices can be easily remedied. When we are one—when I become an open sea to His vessel— He will understand.” The Presque Mort hauled up on the platform as they retreated. The other had been arrested and cursed, twisting his heels on a cat. His flailing fists turned, with more than half of them—the Mort who , from all that, had both arms on their rapidly blackening eye, and a bruise bloomed on another’s cheek as his hand tangled
