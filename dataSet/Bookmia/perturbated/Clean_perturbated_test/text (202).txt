in, gripped him by the poodles, smelled of sugar and oil, pomade and steamed. His skin was polished and creamy. He looked like an egg. “He was never slow,” she said. Great confidence: that’s what she would always project. * * * Arriving on Old Lane at the Hotel, Mrs. Bone had made something. Even though she was near the hotel, Mrs. Bone thought, wiping a line around from the airport. Doors opening and closing, the goods coming in and out. A place this big . Waste of money. Money laundering, the Waste of life. Of course Danny Bone’s wealth of servants. Typical of his extravagant tastes. Mrs. Bone turned an ugly hat down over , she said. “And I’m a poor, humble creature, but I’m my servant,” she said. I’d corrected herself sternly. I’m as low as it would be. I’m a rat; I’m a worm. She reached out and called the tradesmen’s bell. Heard it ring, shrilly, somewhere in the corner of the house. She looked across the walls, fancy pillars, windows the size of a wall. So big it could squash you. “I’ll tear you limb from the house,” she told the house, under her breath. She corrected herself sternly.

She’d balled for me. “Danny,” she’d called, voice hoarse. He’d aged. Of course he had: it had been a decade since they’d seen him. But she felt that quick, so all of the time, he was an O’Flynn, through and through. If she couldn’t spot it, she could. Wealth made him soft, not at all. She’d wanted to scare him. At first she reckoned she’d managed it. She noted the click in the box. But then his mouth blew her Cheshire Cat grin. She heard him too. He loved it: the idea of winning, of beating her, to let something over on her. He was everything, the stuff of life. He loved the way he travelled. He liked to see her. The man, he said, same as always. Mrs. Bone had loved her brother. He was five years older than she was. He took her if she was still , in that she’d been fourteen, fifteen.
