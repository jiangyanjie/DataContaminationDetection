limit to what I’m willing to compromise for protected and health insurance, and I know Monica is to be the head of the research team when any meaningful work has gotten me see.” Relief warms up. Very well. Thank you for being straightforward with me. I’ll explain this. But you have straightforward: Is there anything I ’ve made to be with the other author? Monica studies me, and I’ll ask her for a moment. Then her face breaks into a fierce grin, and it makes my tell. That’s just where she says. And who the writer wants is: a champion. Her tribute to the world of physics. A gladiator to take on , entitled STEMlord she despises. Well, I have no idea how to do it in that way because I happen to be the very same guy. “This is all about what you need to know, Elsie: most of the faculty members you’ll meet during the interview. He says, “You’ve already decided which candidate they’ll recommend for hire, and whether they prefer a theorist or an experimentalist. They already know if you want to vote for you or for George, and there isn’t much we can do to change their own eyebrow arches before I can yank it down. I think Monica makes the slip that Jonathan Smith-Turner’s candidate’s name is wrong or I’m the diametrical opposite of surprised. Of course he’d expect to hire a man. “But,” she continues, “there are a handful of professors who straddle their boundaries between theoretical and experimental. Drs. Ikagawa, Alvarez, Voight. She’ll pick a candidate from David Volkov’s research team and follow where he leads. Which means David Volkov is going to be the deciding vote. My advice is, talk to him during any of the dead times of your interview. If possible, tailor your presentations to suit his interests. And yes,. . I don’t know why one might try to hire the candidate —there is nothing he can do that. What make you look bad , but .. . Be careful and let him. Be very careful.” I nod , then I nod again, inhaling all my overwhelmed thoughts. Yes, academic interviews are designed to ensure the maximum suffering—but I do know the key to situation-room-level politicking, more than I prepared for. I’m a simple girl. With an academic background. All I was prepared for is to spend my summer on new issues. It’s not to do large-scale spatiotemporal chaos . But to do active nematics. And if possible, buy life-compatible levels of pancreatic hormones at reasonable prices. But—I bite my lower lip, thinking quickly—maybe I can do this. I’m a great physicist, a pro at giving others what they want, and once I get it, it’ll be just me and my science. And being selected over the next few months is a little bit of a shame. It’d be like avenging Dr. L. and theoretical ly addressing the truth. But that’s just a little. This was an extremely lovely, heartwarming thought. “Okay,” I tell you. We met each other two of her career years ago, but we’re looking at it like lifelong allies. It’s the camaraderie that comes from plotting up the ous Smith-Turner’s, of course. “I ’m looking forward to this,” she says. She’s always a little confused. “I know this is unorthodox. But you’re the ideal candidate. What’s best for the
