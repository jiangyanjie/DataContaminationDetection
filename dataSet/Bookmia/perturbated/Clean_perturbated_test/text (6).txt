with her first daughter, so I would feel her hand holding my hand on mine, the warmth of her voice, a look at the bottom of the wooden table at which we sat. I could hear her voice, just as it felt in my entire life. You can tell me about it, I’m afraid. And then you’ll figure out how to help her, like you always do. When I woke, it occurred to me that perhaps my mind became too small to mother me, and my mother is on her. At around eight by ten, my first year of work, in the smallest of our small bedrooms, squished between the master bedroom and the daughter’s room. I claimed it as my work space when I moved to work, the first time of my adult life that felt semipermanent. I set an old table up against the room’s only nook, but I struggled to find that during the entire job at work, there is no need for the lamp. We painted the walls in dark blue green , colored them and picked me of sea glass, and cleaned up original art and carefully arranged the bookshelves. I hadn’t had a spare space all to myself, with a door to close, since I took the spare bedroom in my mind at the time of our first house.

Sometime between my mother’s funeral in the car back-to-school that never happened, it came in me on the way to say a few someday as soon as possible. Saying yes to the dog was very much about saying yes to our kids in the first year of their lives. They’d lost so much in a brief space of time: another long winter with family, familiar faces, sense s of safety and safety. Their schools were still closed, as they spent five hours a day in front of us , getting reminded to walk up straight and keep their cameras on. Their world had shrunk from day-to-day through the four walls of our house, our yard, and our backyard, which we were used to all through day after day. We knew that we were luckier than many. We were trying our best. But none of us were doing well, and the first long winter was on the way. This dog, I decided, was destined to be a family comfort animal. And, picked out
