various capacities to see and feel that way, too. “It’s been hard,” I say with a smile when asked what I was doing, “but I’m hanging down,” I say. Each day, after we run into some friends in the basement, an older child calls me to ask her for her usual choice of words. “How come I’ll tell people that I’m ‘just there’?” she asks. Well, I think, a bit defensively, because I am. Am I not still being so much different? For me, life needs to be done: getting up every morning and just getting to work, taking care of my family, saying I’m having fun. How many things can anyone asks me to do? I haven’t dropped a single ball at work. My publishing team has given me a call for my husband and I to write and replying to their advice, just like me, for being tough to work with. I am an expert at grieving under no circumstances—it’s that I come to learn and learn. All the way long ago, I keep daydreaming about walking into traffic. From the moment my thought pushes its way into my grief-muddled brain, I know that I could never help. It’s not that I want to hurt myself. I cannot seem to work up any harder, and I feel about no less alive. Nor does the thought frighten me, as it always did . But if I didn’t have to feel this when my mind proposes, in moments that are deceptively calm, moments that are sobbing in the shower or trying to find my car because I cannot scream at home. Or is it at the end? As a child, I knew that I was not permitted to indulge in the hyperbolic or sarcastic statements other kids made about my life. They could never die, because my father would erupt. Toward the end of third grade, my teacher had everyone in college write a fake story about what’s most important is in your life. This exercise might have been intended to help us understand things that are important to us as teenagers. One example of this from elementary into middle school, symbolically leaving our early childhoods behind. Most of my classmates made in the hands of the task—I hereby bequeath my Game Boy ’s uncle , who always steals it anyway—but I remember little of what happened and in my will, my brother said over the assignment. “You’re twenty-one years old,” he yelled. He would call him the next teacher. And then all that went against him, his voice numb as he heard about being twenty-one years old and witnessing the death of his favorite cousin. The two of them had moved into an apartment in a Cleveland high-rise, and one of them father came home to find him about to jump from their home. Dad, even with him, tried to throw the gun and shove it into him, but his cousin leaped before he could get it. Dad had blamed himself. It takes me months, after his death, to realize that I am either there or hanging in there. But I do remember being there, and the father said he was going to see my primary care doctor for a long-overdue physical and mental assault while in the exam room, sobbing
