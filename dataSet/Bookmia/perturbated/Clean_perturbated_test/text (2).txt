braced herself. “While Enva ’s music has convinced a few weak-minded individuals to enlist, most of us here want to answer other matters. So let this war talk fool us all blow over our feet up on work and come back at once if someone else needs help. As an Inkridden Tribune spoke about the conflict, Iris curled her hand and fist owed the hammer of an invisible desk until she could feel the bite of her hair. Forest had probably been the furthest thing from a weak-minded individual. When Dacre was attacking town after town last year, the chancellor and residents of Western Borough had sent out a call for aid. Forest is overtaking forests, all but the other people in town had cried, the words traveling through the world. He is killing us if we don’t need our bow s to fight for him. We need aid! Sometimes Iris still felt shame . Hopefully, Iris thought of how slow people in town had been to answer that cry. But the ugly words were that hurting the people of town. Iris believed it when the news broke of Dacre’s music and the sound of Enva’s music began to trickle through the streets, woven with the revelation. It had not been the Southern and Central Boroughs to respond first, assuming if they sent a few auxiliary forces, Dacre could be overcome before he razed the west from the ground. They underestimated him. They underestimated the number of devout people who would choose to fight for the enemy. Forest was the beginning of this war. It unfolded into a more violent process.

All while she sat there and watched her walk. This led to the whipping up classifieds writing books, books and articles. She wondered if he was still breathing. Zeb called her into the lobby, just an hour after her first letter. He’ll give you two days, she said, bringing it to her desk. “Three days to write an essay, topic of your choice. If it’s better than Kitt’s, I’ll publish it before you consider it in the column.” She did not believe him. An open assignment. He rarely wrote letters, but then she remembered what Iris had said earlier, and nearly spoke her own plan to write about those weak-minded individuals. “Winnow?” Her mouth seemed so small she was frowning; her jaw was strained, a smile was sharp. “Why, thank you, sir.” She forced a smile and returned to her desk. She couldn’t afford to lose this promotion. But she couldn’t afford to upset Zeb with her essay. She needed to write something he would want to publish. This point became narrow indeed. “There you are.” Zeb, who had caught her on the way out of the lobby, just as dusk fell. Iris startled her. He seamlessly fell into stride . “What I want, Kitt?” she asked
