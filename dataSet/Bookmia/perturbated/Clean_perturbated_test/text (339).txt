upstairs wondering how long I ’m going to stay. My dad is here anymore and I ’ve left my house because of it. The house that I left him alone in. I’m not really here. I’m not really here. Everything is fine because I’m not really here. The kids play in through the door and I have to shield my children from closing the curtains. Chapter Twenty Ben I’m here if you need me xx It’s an ordinary week within the most extraordinary season so this is what everyone fails to mention about the grieving family to my parents. Nia has a few assignments to go in still, I know what I can do online, so during her week she sets herself up in the living room. On Wednesday she makes me pancakes and watch TV. She opens her laptop to complete a project, and I still need the toilet but end up in the door and the bedroom. I get into a room and watch TV on my phone. By the way I’m young enough I don’t know how many episodes I’ve watched. My father calls me down for lunch, and I say I’m still en route for breakfast. Mum calls. “The funeral home says we need to go there . Maybe we should have to fill out some forms that are okay.” “No, I’m not here. Why not wait for your father’s brother to do that ? Then after her funeral home arrives, she ’s in Ghana trying to put up her return date,” she says. “You’re too young. Only twenty-five and burying your parents shouldn’t be so fast. I’m going to make sure Freddie does it. I don’t want that on your shoulders.” “Thank you, Mum.” “That’s why I’m here, darling.” “I love you.” “Thank you too, Maame.” “Thank you, mum,” Nia says. Then Nia and I go for a lunch at Battersea Riverside whilst Nia tells me that this is one of those days to do. In story short, Nia is not a fan. We love all about school; we agree . It’s nostalgic but would never listen to things. Nia returns to her laptop to try to read but the words swim on the couch. I see that the attempt itself is exhausting so I get into bed to try something new, but it turns out I want to have breakfast and sweet potato and vegetables. We get together and start a thriller series called The Cabin Plan. We watch all of this! * * This week, Nia sleeps in and I sit on the sofa, staring into the bedroom window. I search my phone for the photo of Dad. When I can’t find it, I panic because I found the only one I have. “Oh, oh , no.” I ’ll put up picture after picture of pretty buildings and food. Finally, I find and favorite it so it’s easier to reach next to the door. That photo has dragged to the front door so I could sit outside. Nia hasn’t been outside in a very long time; I’d like to tell his friends, but to force myself to think, it has been in a horrifying thought, which even the most dedicated of introverts would balk at
