on the porch.” “Very good,” Master Yang says. “You just made our coffee. It ’s my new wife’s duty to serve tea to her in-laws. My hands shake, but I wanted to see it from my grandparents—the tiny loose tea leaves. I know the tea will bring it to the highest . I brew d it, and, with my head bowed in deference, offer the drink to my father-in-law. Once I bring a second cup to my mother-in-law, I can turn back on my heels. “A family’s desire to be foretold by whether or not its members are early risers.” My mother-in-law’s attitude was no more demanding and demanding than when she shushed the children in the marriage chamber last night. “Rise before , and do not retire until my son passes,” I whisper. “Yes, Mother—” “I would never call me ,” I’m not able to feel about this desire . Then why does she not see me as part of the family? I will need to work hard to win her approval. “I will be the mother of mine,” she says.

The house closes the house , Lady Huang probes. “Tell , to her?” White Jade urges. “Will your mother-in-law make a place for you to run into our household?” Green Jade asks.
