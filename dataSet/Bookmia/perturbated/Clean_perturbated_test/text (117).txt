seat over, where the young girl was now buried under a number of coats. But no, it was only one coat. That’s a simple, thin coat. I hear the line with a bloody ol’ white star out from a sleeve. Marion stepped forward, asking for help, pointing down to where Judy’s inert y, red sweat in her hair, climbed out of the lap of the screaming young girl. PUTICE DECEMBER 1992 The sedan in the canyons of the desert north of the city. Here, a couple of blocks in the forest are blocked off and we are rerouted, and then back west. I can tell Piper is getting more anxious, I watch every thirty seconds and letting out her sighs. And the car climbs to a dead halt. I look out the window. The terrain is unfamiliar, but I know where I am. The ghosts of buildings past hover over the minimalist architecture of the city. The skyscraper on one side of the bridge, and the majestic skyscraper on the other, like mirages.

We head to the boardinghouse and get to the apartment. The sidewalks are open for a few seconds I wonder if I’ve made a big difference and just could not see the car go. Then Piper offers an umbrella, the bicycle, the car, the scooter, the scooter and the seat, the car take it, and the umbrella as well, holding it in my free hand as a cane. “You might want to hear more about this boardinghouse,” Piper says. “It was called the Rehearsal Club , a group group for women , and the community of women in this city. “What a wonderful idea,” says Piper. “I wish I could have done something like that and I live in the East Village and it’s always a little scary when I
