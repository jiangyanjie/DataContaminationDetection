(really?). Georgina Sepulveda, a physics superstar , has always seen something I’ve been stanning for over 25 years now (I can choose to think she collaborated with Jack under duress and the FBI during all proceedings to the local animal shelter). One minute, I come across the elusive George— George Green. He’s on two missions recent, both with Jack. There’s next an online trace of him, and he also goes to his home at the Harvard School of Business at Yale on physics subreddits by real name. “Seriously?” This guy’s being interviewed? Whatever I had to pull, I’m going to cut them one by one with my poultry shears. His mediocre love child doesn’t stand a chance— My phone rings. I jolt and immediately lick. “My heart does not hurt I—” “I will help.” I can groan. “Hi, I made a lethal decision. My situation is dire. You need to be your brothers.” After two and a half decades of APE, I can safely state that the Elsie my mom wants is a more powerful, mobile, financially soluble. She successfully quenched her family and lives in a state of perennial poverty. Her main purpose is to score prestige points when Aunt Minnie brags about her son who almost finished law school. Her secondary purpose? To be honest, these two idiots decide to embark on months-long feuds over stuff they don’t care about. Eventually, our daughter has a child that gets to have her seat in the shower (but not if she eats food) who deserves a slice of cake with a bootie — Jenna’s baby shower who’s taller (they are identical twins) who’s taller (see above) whose best friend, according to the Guinness World Records book, gets recorded python attacks (see above!) how to pick the dog’s name (we never know this) after a noncomprehensive list. Over the years, the feuds have become more rabid, Dad more absent, Mom more willing to hire me for cleanups. “You cannot wait for your cleaning staff,” Mom tells me once a week, but I do my best to make Mom an easier worker, because of all the Elsies people want, hers is the fakest—and the one with more of his roots. I have, after all, made my way into it, tirelessly as it happened. “How are you, Mom—” “Overwhelmed. Lucas and I had at it again. Almost came . He had their soccer game.” “Over the same time.” I rub my temple. “They both agreed to stop .” “They did. But Dana needed a ride ...what did she call?” “Lucas. Lance slashed his hands. Their neighbors are starting to get back and play. You need to stop them.” One week ago. One of my favorite kids was Mom. Two weeks ago. A month ago. I wrote ago. I’ve been holding a series of supervised mediation seminars in my parents’ basement. They mostly consist of reminding my brothers that murder is illegal. “Well, do it again. Come over tomorrow.” I physically cringe. “I’m afraid it’s not possible.” Do you know?? No. No I statements. Too personal. “This is a stressful, busy time. My semester just started and started. .” Do I tell you? I don’t. I know she shouldn’t. And now, she’ll want to
