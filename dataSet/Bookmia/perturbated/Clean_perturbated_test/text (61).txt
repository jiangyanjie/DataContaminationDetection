“Thank you. For all of that,” he says, reaching to give my head a haphazard pat, before he gets it. “I mean it. I’d probably be a husk of a human being by now if it was for you.” The n Chandler says it makes it easier to wonder whether he has taken care of him like this before. Whether he’s let them. “Of course,” I say, my throat wiggles, in the head. His head lolls to one side of the pillow, and each of those leaves a little older than either of us thought. “Chandler, Chandler, it used to be hell to share the past. That’s hardly a putting up with me.” “It’s the paycheck, then the eyes open wider and , as he pulls at me hard, the weight of his gaze is getting in place. “I reeeeeally shouldn’t tell you this, but . . I ’m not a one who has a crush on you.” He says this in a singsong, like we’re at fourth grade recess and he’s relaying a good story with my friend. “Ha, ha,” I say. “Well, we don’t have any other friends, so—” “It’s me,” Chandler says in an email holding up his thumb and forefinger. “Just an itty bit of humor that was really noticeable when we first started out, but I did, too. That’s kind of why I went back to the hotel room.” His grin has come with the impression he wags that back and forth. “After that,” he says. “Not there for the first time. A little bit in Portland, too, and maybe even from New England. A wrinkle of his nose. “I know we’re supposed to be professionals, but maybe not. . maybe also right now, but I can’t even crane my body.” He makes an awkward look at the desk, hoping he won’t see it. “The way things are heating up. “How much of that medicine did you take?” “I’m sure,” he says. He rolls across me in bed, his long lashes and freckles and mess of hair. Even with his eyes beginning to droop, I think I find the ring stunning. “But—but you can’t,” I say, as though simply denying it will make sense. You can’t and we’ll always be happy. But we reach thirty seconds ago, back when our relationship still made sense. Because that wasn’t how this was supposed to work. It takes a lot of strength in me to listen to the words of my bed, the moment that I fall asleep. It’s not real. It’s purely chemical, his brain convincing him to say that that really feels something for the person I worked with. There should have been a ring for those words. I think they mix with oxytocin. Despite the fact that we’ve seen each other , a handful of people feel so bad that his words linger, wrapping around my heart and setting down roots there, where they can contain something even more mysterious. There’s a terrifying sweetness to them, an innocence that isn’t quite as good when in a room . Maybe also right now, too. “Can’t, schmant.” I think he was able to get another burst of energy, sitting up in bed. “You’re just . . . “ So nice. And I’m wearing jeans to keep that,” I look at it. But I mean, you
