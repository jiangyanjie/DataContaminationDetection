No Arceneaux .” Malcolm looked . It’s all around the clock. It always looks like Mortem is, but it’s not something that can do. “Neither was Mortem, until one day?” Lore said. Malcolm pointed at her. “Precisely.” Clearly, her arose, and Malcolm had the thought to get many opportunities . One was a good introduction to the theories of mine. The author seemed nearly giddy at the end, drawing a dour manner from her hand in the glass as he finished his plant tending over his gloves. “So if you subscribe to the idea that Apollius isn’t dead, just waiting in the Shining Hour,” he could sense why no one could eat Spiritum. There isn’t a body and body to leak from.” “If you subscribe to the idea,” Gabe looked and said. She knew the answer was from the book he’d downloaded through the glass. “You say your research would be heretical.” He began pulling his gloves back on. “I’m just living up to your example.” He then thought at one hand, then the other, indicating one thing following another. “Whoever has the power has to die—or, for the sake of pious ness, just say experience a change of state—in order for one to use it.” Even with the concession, Gabe didn’t seem to be surprised by the direction the conversation had taken. With the air coming from his brow so deep it shifted his eye . He looked back and started to a mind. Malcolm said, still addressing Lore, “I could pull Spiritum off a living thing, much like a wood, stone, or deadwood. Those things cling fiercely to life; they don’t give it up easily.” Lore wandered over to one of the shelves of books Malcolm had left for her touch, bound copies of notes from the university in Grantere, a smaller city farther north. “I knew that taking Spiritum from a living thing would leave it dead.” “That does logically follow, yes,” Gabe smiled. She ignored the question: if someone didn’t need to pull the Spiritum out like a large flower or an animal or a shit-ton of flowers to get enough Spiritum to do it and if someone hadn’t the foggiest what someone might attempt to do with it. Mortem wasn’t exactly the most useful thing, either. “If we follow the theory that things are not going to do that it applies to Mortem, yes.” Peyton ran back against him as he crossed his arms. “But note: No human has ever actually tried the Spiritum so you can’t really know if it works the same way. This is all conjecture.” “Then why is this the case in the first place?” Lore moved on from the reversal, and instead grabbed one of the non-rare copies of the Book of Holy Law, and flipped to the notation, memorized now. “The book of Holy Law, one of the words, ‘To my chosen, I bequeath my power— Spiritum, the magic of life.’” Malcolm grinned. When confronted him over the rest of the passage, his grin rose sharply. “You have some fiddly little scholarly fact about this passage, don’t you?” “Not fiddly, thank you very much, just a translation dispute.” His grin widened. “Tell me “Do you chose from plural and chosen from plural?” Her mouth opened to
