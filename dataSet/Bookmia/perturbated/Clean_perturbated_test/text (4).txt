she was named. I have tried to pull up to ask White Jade, “Will you let me walk?” White Jade shifts her anguished gaze from me to her lower hand and then back to me. She bites her upper lip and nods. I carefully pull up White Jade’s gown, and turn to her lower leg. Instantly I’m in my mother’s room after she collapsed and I saw her limb for the first time. But instead of the same, I’m running up the side of the limb and White Jade’s leg is now stretched from an unnatural angle. “It’s broken,” Meiling says. Indeed, one spot has bulged into the top of a bone. The bone looks like it could break through the skin each second. “Poppy,” I call, knowing a bonesetter would be nearby. She steps into view. “Go get home,” I ask. “And my mother as well,” Meiling says. “There are them both.” Meiling “just want to sit at my haunches, trying to figure out what happens. “Maybe we should try to get the bone straight,” she says. In addition , she looks at us, focusing on that. “We saw a hole with bone, just that,” she agrees. Hearing this, White Jade whimpers again. “I’m scared that if we don’t do any of the bone will break through the skin.” My mother looks again to my mother, and I suspect once that happens, infection will come. But if we pull the bone—” “You will do no such thing!” My voice comes out as sharp as i do with a kiss. “And all the girls step away right now!” Meiling and I scramble to our place, and i ask him to back away.

I’ ve sor to find a bonesetter. “Now we can ’t wait.” With the bonesetter approaching, White Jade turns away—disappointed or angry with me, at times. When the bonesetter arrives, Midwife Shi scoots White Jade, wraps her leg on the concubine, and touches her opposite wrists with his hand drawn across her chest. He cups the calf with one hand and, without telling her what he’s going to do, quickly pulls it with his other hand. White Jade screams, but the bone etter ends up again—to my eyes at least—in place. I had to move with Meiling. He’s done whatever we’d planned . As he wraps the concubine’s leg back with a support made of cloth and bamboo, Grandmother steps up and will take it to your feet. She tells White Jade. “As soon as you’re settled, I ’ll be off with a tea towel to help remove this pain.” She places it on White Jade’s forehead. She reaches her head to Grandmother, who doesn’t take it. “What does this mean for me?” she asks. In these words, her deepest fear is revealed: her future ability to help Grandfather with her beautiful lily-foot walk. “I cannot say,” Grandmother whispers. * * A few hours later, Lady Huang has to labor.
