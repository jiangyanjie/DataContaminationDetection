“More? No? No.” “Anything.” “Very well. I had a smuggler who was seven.” “A snail?” Iris ’s name was Morgie. I kept him a serving dish with a little tray of water , flowers and beautiful wilted flowers. I took him all of my time and happened to take this guy to school. He slinked for my day when I was at school. I came home to discover him in the evening and he was nowhere to be found. I cried for a bit. “I can imagine that ,” Roman said, at which Iris playfully batted him. “Don’t poke fun at me.” “I’m not, Iris.” He effortlessly caught her hand in his, and they fell to a halt in the middle of her mouth. “Tell me more.” “More?” she breathed, and while they felt guilty, she didn’t pull away from him. “If I see anything else today, you’ll not see any of me.” “Impossible,” he whispered. She felt that shyness creeping over her face. The thing was happening right now, and why should it happen? Why were the wings were beating in her stomach? “What’s your middle name?” Roman asked .
