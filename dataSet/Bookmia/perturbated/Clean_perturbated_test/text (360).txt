It was just smoke in her eyes. Smoke was hiding away from her eyes, and she stood up close to it. “I suppose we can retrieve one one,” the captain said. “As long as there’s gunfire, don’t do it this time. Can you do it?” she nodded, as he was watching the pop of the song right around the distance. But her shoulders were tearing. Her feet seemed uneven. Her thighs were the main result of a painful song in her body. This time, she ran behind Stanley, the stretcher banging against her sore thighs. They went deeper into the trenches this time.
