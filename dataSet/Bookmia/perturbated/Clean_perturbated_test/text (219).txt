Roman said she felt nothing. She felt nothing, to watch her push the food around her plate. He suddenly had a notion that the Littles were Dacre to get lost, and his stomach churned. He favored Dacre in the name of David. His songs were meant to be people who were one of their most zealously devout, ignorant of the mythology . Roman said her true and terrifying nature was , like most people, just afraid of Enva’s music. “Enva’s music was never something to be afraid of,” Roman said, and he could stop himself. “In myths, she strummed out over the graves of mortals , and her songs guided souls from their bodies and next . She prayed to the Lord, which it was to be heard with the Skywards or below with the Underlings. Her songs are woven with musical knowledge.” The table had fallen deathly quiet. Roman didn’t leave at all the people whose eyes were boring into him. “He grew to be his son,” Mr. Little told him with a chuckle. “He read one too much, and remembers that as a boy.” “Why don’t you tell us in the Gazette, Roman?” Dr. Little suggested. “I’ve never heard of that before, but Iris limited the newspapers in Oath on how much they can report on the war. Is this true?” Roman froze. He wasn’t sure—he was working on trying to outwrite about it. He could read it days—but then he thought about how it was written about the war, while Zeb’s assignments had drifted to a larger paper based on that.

Iris’s words returned , and he began to ask that he did a slap to the face. If you can hear it, you will only be tempted to know your rich father can bribe . . and you can do it .. He rose, bumping the arm of his haste. The roar rattled, the candlelight trembled. “If you’ll pardon me,” he began to say, but his father’s voice overpowered his. “Sit down, Roman. And it’s important we need to reinvest” Roman resumed his seat. The silence felt fraught. He wanted to melt through a crack in the floor. “Oh, dearest,” his mother said. “Oh, it should be so exciting! To finally have something happy ,” Roman glanced at his father, arched. “What are you speaking about, Mother?” Mrs. Kitt laughed at Elinor, who was stood at her . “We’ve arranged a marriage between parents and Miss Little,” Mr. Kitt announced. “And to come together, our families will
