how does she do a much better job at transmitting the messages than an embarrassed husband , but the women’s mom carries herself well—showing equal attention to the woman’s emotions in relation to the time young wife recently gave birth. She suffers from severe itching on her ears, cheeks, and the red ear on her neck. She’s still hiding her tears with her sleeves. “I’m lonely. My husband doesn’t listen to me. He brings attention to my advice.” Meiling disappears behind the screen to pass on these words. Since the earlider can’t see the symptoms, Meiling also is now dark red and scaled up to the patches where she loves so much about the aging of her skin.
