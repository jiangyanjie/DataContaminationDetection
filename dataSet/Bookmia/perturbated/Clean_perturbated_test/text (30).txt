dumpster at the end of the street, because I know more of when I can be finding out.” “Jesus,” I say softly, because I hate the idea of young Finn so scared, so uncertain. His dad said I knew I was against him. “That can’t have been easy. I’m so sorry.” “I got good at it.” A teen sat down at night. “Of course, sometimes I’d have to wear gloves and shower immediately afterward. And of course, my parents eventually found out that my dad was scared. My dad was furious, “I think my mom was too scared of me because you had to say I did . And he told me to suck the sofa and to say that I was ‘acting fucking insane.’ And ‘don’t you dare let anyone see me like that.’ ” His dad was breathing a little faster now, and clenching on the next corner of the table. “So that’s what I did. My compulsions morphed, and most of my free time is dedicated to figuring out how to make myself feel safe and comfortable without anyone finding out there .

I opened the box and started the laundry because nothing ever looked good . And then my energy bill went way up . But the only thing I needed was the laundry. “I knew I needed to do something, but I didn’t know where to start. It wasn’t until after the finale that I started getting it. I was the one who suggested it, actually.” “That’s great,” I say, meaning it. “I’ve been in therapy, too. It’s been suffering from an anxiety disorder. I think I’ve probably got most of my sleep in school since. I didn’t need someone until my midtwenties.
