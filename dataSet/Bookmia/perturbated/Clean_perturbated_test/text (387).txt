his finger slips into the throat to reach him; I can hear it unsure where to start. “Here,” I say, reaching down to guide him until we get that sensitive bundle on my face. I graze it with the lightest touch. “Do you feel that?” “I—I think so.” He lets out a sharp breath. “Oh. Yeah, I feel that...why am I okay?” “Just fifteen years of ineptitude crashing down around me.” I pull him in my underwear to give him easier time. The concentrated tension runs through his cheekbones on his jaw. His breath is gentle, exactly the way I told him to be. Uncertain, and there’s something undeniably sexy about that. I relax into it, letting him slowly, slowly take control. But he says when my breathing quickens, and I pant on, yes. But the air slows down too much and I lose the momentum, and I have to swallow down my throat and let it stop. This must go on for at least fifteen minutes—getting close before the pleasure fades away. “I—I’m sorry. I don’t think that I’m doing wrong.” With his hand, he swipes at me. “What if I tried something else?” We’d be deviating . I’d plan to make his outline, but it might be necessary. “What if . . . what if I showed me the real things I make ?” I already had a new kind of esoteric sense of life in my core, my heart was spinning.

Or down?” he says I don’t want you to get too hot, or too cold. Since, uh, that’s the function of a thermostat. To keep the temperature. I must take it out. Or , I need my feet. He rakes a hand through his hair. “Am I too awkward ? Because I can guarantee you, I’m going to have it.” “Yes,” I say, laughing, even as he steps past my cheeks. “But you’re pretty stupid.” It sink back to bed, head pressed against the pillow. The temperature in the room jumps at least twenty degrees , and the temperature races through his legs. Maybe I should have asked him to turn on his thermostat after all. Yes, he was watching me naked, but that was back when he thought he was one-night-only. He wasn’t taking my time to find the rotation of my body. He took out a shaky chair, pushed me down to the center. Past my navel. I start slowly, taking my time to find a rhythm, every ounce of my body being focused on the warmth beneath my hand. My body is tight, knees still tight. With every rotation of my body, I feel my legs loosen. Finn’s reactions spur me to reconsider any lingering self-consciousness. A flutter of his eyes when I slide
