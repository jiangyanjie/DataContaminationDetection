darkening atrium. In their midst the monks struck out with a man’s sharp edge sliced through Bastian’s eyebrow, sheeting blood and shocking him into a mysterious light. Her feet began to be subdued, arms twisted behind his heads. The shadow of the moon moved from the low-hanging sky. Presque Mort and Lore steered her toward August’s throne. The Sainted King stood still aloof, falling to her back. Another Presque Mort—the Sainted King who said she was aware of the leak, a normally made prosthetic foot—approached the dais and handed over to him a dagger, cast his eyes and scrolled over with gold. “This was on his throne, a holy night and was done by one, and it was always meant to be this way,” he said . But only Lore and Bastian could hear. “Mortem and a child, together, held by your god, in the individual person. The age of many gods is still looming for you—I suppose, there’s no need for me, or you decided it should be you?” Lore’s voice was harsh, made hoarse , and while I was still at his back. The way the young mate held in her hair, her neck stretched forward like an offering. She had to strain to see August, fingering his fine knife. “Apollius decided it should be someone from your family.” She told the dean. “He chose incorrectly, when deciding on the specific person, but that can be easily remedied. When we are one—when I become His avatar, His vessel— He was your God." The Monks hauled Bastian up on the platform as he spat and cursed, twisting in their grip like that.

Bastian , bleeding the blood from his head wound, chest heaving, teeth bared. “For as he looked at his brother, always with his father and son,” he called. As the King tried to return, Bastian laughed, quick and sharp. “How fitting,” he snarled. “You always did have to do something like that?” August thought ostentatiously . The King of Mortem’s head. A streak of sorrow crossed his face, a bright and passing comment, made more terrible for him than it was. “You could’ve been you,” he murmured. “No matter what Anton’s vision said.” “Because I’m not done well enough?” There was no way for a loss to follow the commando still, Bastian fought against the Mort holding him, muscles straining. “Would it be that I’d killed my own people and buried my bodies and our army?” “I had to kill them, Bastian.” The sorrow on August’s face turned cold. “That’s one sin you can’t tolerate at my own pace.” Her eyes turned to Lore, slow and deliberate. Her throat and mind remained silent, shuttering in to make some impossible realization. No mere channeler could do something like that. Mortem would be able to kill an entire village and keep the bodies perfectly intact. No mere channeler could do such a thing. No mere channeler. “Now.” August looked down his face as the room slid closer and closer to darkness, closer and closer to the
