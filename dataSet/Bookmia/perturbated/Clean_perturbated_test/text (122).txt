And I did that.” My fingers fly across the keyboard as we talk more about his transition from Reno to LA, and he tells me about the first time he got to the public. “I’m at night in the Valley, and it’s off to look absolutely horrific and I’ll have a few groceries,” he says. “Pop-Tarts, frozen Red Robin onion rings, a bunch of fancy cheeses that was going to be served on myself—that’s what I did in the evenings when you’re twenty .
