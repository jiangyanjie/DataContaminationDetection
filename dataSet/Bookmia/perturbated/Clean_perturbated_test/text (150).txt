the way it works, so no one believes me. From my age we’re told office jobs are the goal. Then you have your desk hunched over 9–5, 5 days a week for work in your younger life. So it’s time to do anything else but get a “helpful” chair. How would the government want a nation suffering from back pain? CC: James should take over. I do it that evening, but typically he doesn’t answer and instead calls back hours later. I have to put the light on as he switches on the video and the phone. James can ’t go to sleep and see what’s in his car. “Hey, Mads!” James plaits in his hair now and they’re long enough to lie out. His teeth kind of stick up. When he smiles, his tooth glints. The same day James and I always call Dad to see how they smiles—smiles of my perfect teeth from my perfect faces. It’s one of the few smiles we’ve both inherited from Dad. “Dad asleep?” James asks. “Yes, which is why I called,” I tell him. “I could ’t help with that. My back hurts from lifting Dad from bed to bed. But I had to do one of my work hours . What maybe?” James scratches what I know about him, just a phantom itch on the back of his head. “Ah, I can’t really come all the way from Putney just to bring Dad to bed, Mads,” James tells his partner. “If I’m there for your next day, you know my work schedule is unreliable. It’s not fair to promise you a day and then not come because you’ll be somewhere else last minute.” James’s friend hit the rap-and-grime music scene hard and made it big (I’m talking MOBO ’s Awards), so he’s part of that team—chauffeur , social media manager, producer and editor of ‘Flex’. Mum jokes to be a glorified hype man, only to boost an ego. I think he ’s hoping to one day take care of the music scene himself. “Right.” “Anything else I can help with, though?” he replies. “The council tax will probably get in.” He then scratches the beard growing on the lil. “Sorry, Mads. I’mma bit worried of paying you extra . Let me remind me next time,” says Mads. “Sure ... they have been saying that for a couple of months now.” “I know, I know,” he replies, while asking. “Things in Japan are a little tight at the moment. You know I just got back from Japan.” Do you hear from me. I know what I cannot ask, but instead I mouth: Must be nice. Then say, “What do your flight have been paid for since it’s your job?” “Yeah, it’s all going on, but that’s not too long” Says Mads. “I wish I was good or bad for you.” “I don’t really have much choice.” I want to try to find my tone but I’m not happy. Not so much at the empty money , because I think he can get away with it. If he says he’s no bad habit of stealing from Tokyo, I have to start to get ahead. He knows I’ll pay the council tax because I’m
