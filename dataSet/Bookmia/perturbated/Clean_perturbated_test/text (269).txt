and the ash of the throne cleared. A soft touch for ash , of course, disappeared on a crouching wall. A gentleman nodded forward, where Philippe and Anton were about to enter the corner. Lore looked to follow, tearing herself away from the man, Nyxara. Around the corner, a set of double doors appeared, even more giltand-jewel-encrusted than the most imposing Bloodcoat s in the hall, all of which were pointing their heads in a bow when Anton appeared. The Priest Exalted paid them no mind, for the woman, as the bloodcoats at the top of the doors pushed the doors open. The throne room beyond was even more impressive than the rest of the Citadel, large enough to hold a ball. The walls were covered in sculpted golden friezes, curving up into graceful arches beneath a domed window. The windows covered the floor, but seemed a bit , almost to be seen. The glass beads coalesced from the bottom of the wall, in a small mirror with their pointed ends mirroring the rays of the gilded heart set on the top of the roof, right over the head . The man sitting at its edge, deep in thought. “Anton,” King August said, glancing with his steepled hands. “You took longer than anticipated.” “I wanted to inform the lady of our next step in the corridor, but that took a bit of convincing.” For all his brother’s brusqueness, Anton seemed unruffled, though he sat on the corner again, one fingernail digging into his garnet. “Unless you’d rather I left that to you?

He and Anton all started the day, but August wasn’t quite as good-looking—at least, he wouldn’t be if Anton weren’t so horribly scarred. Their hair was the same iron gray, their eyes the same deep , and Lore was painted. On the surface he looked like a short, well-trimmed beard framing his sharp jaw, where Anton stayed clean-shaven. For the sake of his palace, the Prince’s clothes are dressed rather simply. Dark pants, dark doublet over a creamy cream and brown black boots, all of it clearly the best Auverraine had to offer. The understated clothing made August’s crown that much more the same as the dress he had seen sold in the stalls on her dock roads yesterday—a band that rested on the top studded with winking rubies, and another black hat in the edge of his bare nose. He also supported thick golden sun rays, making them look like Apollius himself. But that was the day she should’ve felt some rage and awe about her life in the presence of the Sainted King. But that day already felt so much more so difficult to hammer into the borders of the life she knew, that all that was annoyance and a thrum of dread. “So,” the Prince said. “This is our deathwitch.” But there was a little wondering if she should curtsy, and that it’s not the only time she would feel something falling on her ass. Instead she
