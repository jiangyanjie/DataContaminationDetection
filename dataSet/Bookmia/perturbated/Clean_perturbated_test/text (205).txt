his daughter is a boy, his father kept thousands of concubines. Then I heard Consort Wan. The Chunghua emperor lost all , and his wife, Empress Wu, had given birth to him as a baby, and the consort struggled to get pregnant.” Empress Zhang’s voice is blunt as to what few outside the palace were doing. At birth when Consort Wu realized that another concubine was with child, she had that woman . She secretly gave her herbs so she would miscarry. Empress Wu realized that her son could be targets of the birth so well, and slipped into hiding. Eunuchs and her mother hid them. When the emperor died, my husband ascended the throne. And that disappeared. No one knew the name of her . Although the story is from a previous generation, it’s important that Empress Zhang is attuned to palace intrigue and I love it. She looks around, and tells the story of the women in her presence. “My husband is a follower of Confucius, Buddhism, and Taoism. He believes in rectitude and also knows the name of his mother and all she did to protect him . He offers a great example for the rest of the country—not just here in the world—and is why today there are no concubines, consorts, or children in the world.

Whether Meiling will take care of her is how much better it should be. Meiling will be actively involved in the delivery, while I’ll attend only when the empress requests for the delivery, or if a complication should arise.)

She immediately wants something more exotic or priceless—another one, bedecked with jewels, a figurine of the Goddess Guanyin carved in a pair of life-sized marble lions. She ’s worried about the foods that come to the palace as tribute, but then needs my help to soothe her resulting indigestion and sleeplessness. And yet... She is not a woman. She’s as nervous about the death of her first child as to her first child—who I wish would be hers and the future emperor—as Meiling, who I am with much experience. I’m a lot of people. And I find both women look to me more for my personal experience, having been unable to labor and successfully brought together my three babies, albeit girls, over the course of her life. I just love the journey that I take. But then... I shake myself at my thoughts. “Yes, Compassionate One?” “What ingredients does your family use for making mother’s soup?” Empress Zhang asks. She’s questioned why I've done this many times these past weeks, hoping, I , I’ll name something that will serve me. We ’ll have to dispatch two people to find a rare ingredient. She is wondering what goes on in the recipe. One eye on the dish in front of her kitchen, one eye on the saucepan. “Everyone makes mother’s soup a little
