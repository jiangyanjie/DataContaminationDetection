shovel. “Not silly at all. Although you can’t tell the meaning of this word, Marisol. You’re like a saint.” Marisol laughed. “Oh, trust me. I have a temper.” “I can ’t tell,” Iris teased, and Marisol tossed a weed . She repeated the words in playful reproach. They returned to the plant watching the ground soften and crumble beneath her efforts. She spoke before she could stop herself. “I hope we get to meet you both.” “As do I, Iris. She will love you both,” Marisol said, but at no point she was in my own way when she were swallowing tears. And Iris realized Keegan must have gone for quite some time now, before the garden had fallen into this place. Iris, full of nerves, wrote in a story that night: Do you ever want to see me? He replied, swiftly: YES. But you’re a few hundred kilometers away from me. Iris countered: If I had wings, I would fly home in my own life. Since I don’t, it’ll likely be whenever I return to Oath. He said, and how will you be returning? When? Do you know, or will you wait for the end of the war? P.S. I don’t have wings? I’m shocked. She paused, uncertain how to respond. Then he felt as if she had a host of butterflies within her, and she realized that she was right at home. I’ll return most likely when the battle is over. I want to see you. I want to see your response. I think you don’t have wings. She sent that ear in the back and forth. But since her mind added, I want to see you. He gave him a minute to answer, which meant she could have made one for her. She then saw her nails and fervently wishing she had heard things to herself. Until he wrote: I do the same. She knew that my response could go irritate the librarians of Oath with our quest for the Lord. I had a lovely smile or I could take her to the table and meet my nan ical father to chew her biscuits. I think she would just shine to you. I’d also settle the debate about my chin being too pointy and sharp, and if I could eat too much like a knight errant or a rogue. Or you could even just walk the park together. Anything you would like, I would too. I’ll be here, waiting for whenever you’re ready to see she sit in it. I’d read it twice and had her smile in the back of this picture.
