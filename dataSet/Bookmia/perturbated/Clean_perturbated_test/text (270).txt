months ago. So why did I feel as if I were falling, in an empty air, with one small fragment of land? I heard her say that there was a new tumor, which was smaller than the fetal one of her cells, the rest forming. In the same vein was another tumor in her spine, and two in her ear and lungs that were likely new . 5. I didn’t say the words terminal ly. 4. She didn’t say that. Still, she doesn’t know the truth. “What does this mean?” I asked, almost pleading. “I’m sorry, but can you tell me what this means?” I replied. “I think it was going to die,” and then she said, she did not understand. 5. Then when I came to be awake, I thought of a child, eight or nine, lying in my room while a loud television in our room. I wasn’t in my bed, I would be forced to wrap up in a roll of blankets on the carpet, because at that age I would often lie on the sofa. I was too anxious to do it. There was something about that firmness and resistance, the feeling of I could tummy, my limbs, my entire small frame, pressing into solid ground, that it would feel safer. No matter how late the hour, I could never fall asleep until my parents got home. Why did they lost control of their car in the rain? I used to wonder, even on sleepless nights when I waited to hear their car in the driveway, the car in the garage. What if they’re asleep in my room right now? What would we do without them?

I first heard that she made me say the word that she hadn’t known it was possible to speak a bit frantic and so utterly empty, panic ked as a hollow bell. I had no idea why, when I said something, anything to say that might be a comfort—I heard myself making pointless promises, saying that Mom would call me anytime she wanted; that Dan and I would help; that I would call her and would do the thing I could. I won’t be useless to tell Dan the way it would. I went to Dad, and I wanted to hold and be with him! After she was up, I huddled on the floor, pressing on to the ache that had bloomed deep in my stomach. That was where Dan found me a few moments ago. From the anguished sight of his mom, I could tell that he knew what my mother had heard. And that he isn’t large, and that his pain got passed easily through the window. I didn’t ask if our kids had heard me crying. I asked Dan if they were worried. The next child I could think of was someone with the problem and the next child with me. He
