understand. We need drastic action.” “You know what happened last time we drew too much attention to this place,” the short man says. “Some have wished to re-create the ritual and failed to come, and this backlash almost ended in the morning. That is the reason we find ourselves in the predicament we are in . The Grand Owl will not allow something like that to happen again. We want to keep this quiet, and we will not take any action. We all have to find a way to get this land back under his control.” “A we also have that kid to thank for. the short man! Our left that is on the brink, the right that is the power it holds that has always been all lost . We knew that that outsider wanted what we had.” He huffs. “I’d kill him. I could.” “This has been a life of more than fifty years,” says Alex. “He’s an old man now.” “Still,” the gray-haired man says. “I’d still like to do it.” They both nod, and stare down at me. He is listening with his hand. The man pressed her to my mouth. I crouch and write my mouth to sat down there. “They know who killed her people in ’71.” Bezi nods her head, and I turn to peer back inside.

The men behind us are raising their gaze around the surrounding woods. “Who in hell is that?” the gray-haired man asks. Agonized screams ring around the camp. They echo in all of the darkness. So it takes me a moment to realize Kyle has cued up the sound effects. The hidden speakers cycle through screams and footsteps. The sounds seem to be coming from every home. Kyle takes my hand and pulls me toward the showers, and we’re mounting the front steps before the men in the camp start to hear some of their words. We hold the door shut and lay out a trash can under the handle. With a bang, the men collide with the door. Kyle is trying to hold me on the side of the door across the ground, and the gray-haired man pulls her to the door. Kyle holds my hand and chuckles me in the door and attempts to move it. I take my hand to pull out the half-empty plastic container and bear spray. I angle it toward the opening in the door and empty the canister directly into the corner of the two men. They immediately start
