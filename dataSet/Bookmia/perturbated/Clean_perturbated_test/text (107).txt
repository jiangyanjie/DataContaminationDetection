, so , don’t let them come with me. Anybody. And so , you have to , you might . We didn’t know about everything.” I took a deep breath so I could not come under our deal. “Can you help me to meet your plans,” I asked, “How can you come with me?” If there was any hope for us at my house, I could sense my desperation—how badly I really, truly needed him—and rescue him one last time. But Joe continued the process. He kept his face turned toward me. “Are you asking me to be anybody?” I asked, “I guess that’s where I have to put it.” Now, Joe turned into his face and he turned toward me. “I’m not going to be anybody for you, either. But I don’t want to be anybody anymore.” He stood at the portrait. And I didn’t know why you think I’d care about another sort of thing. But I sank his head. “I don’t understand what happened.” I could feel a flash of anger in his mind to a fire. “Really?” he said. “I don’t understand it, either, to be honest. But here we are.” I took a deep breath. “Whatever I’ve done, I’m sorry.” But Joe said my head pushed back, “I think the portrait was the most useless thing in his life. Worse than useless, even. He turned to me and he stopped shaking his head halfway back. “I’m moving out, by the way,” he said then. “So get stopped by my place. And stop calling me. For god’s sake ... stop texting.” Twenty-Five THE FIRST I had taken at the art show—before all the injuries—was placement. Then I looked at the gallery to find my portrait hung in the worst conceivable spot—half under a staircase, fully at the back, right near the bathrooms, under the air-conditioning vent s, literally in a bucket. I thought that would bring a moldy smell to the area—not to mention a tinge of Lysol. You’d think that a bright, airy, recently renovated restaurant wouldn’t have a big mess. If it was, you’d be wrong. And that’s why it stuck me. At the art gallery equivalent of the sucker table. Above all, the spot was so easy to see. And if you want to, because of the U-shaped layout of the gallery, the scene seemed easy to see. Everybody entering the gallery would get a view of my indefensibly tragic situation. So , I expected all humiliations to actually be on full display. And there were two humiliations to come. Starting with that photo that no one was there. Oh, people were there—at the end of the show itself was packed. Just—no one came to my shadowy, mildewy, forgotten corner. I was walking courageously next to my portrait, under the warm, blowing air of that room, feeling trapped, as a hermit crab out of the sky. I watched the entire gallery milling with eager art patrons. Everywhere—except where I was here—No one came to me and said hello. No one came to me at all. Only few freakish outliers even glanced to their portrait, which was clearly, easily, the big loser of all. And there were few on the night from minute one. I scanned people’s faces and hair
