in her mind . She pulled herself out of nowhere, stumbling on the couch and putting a hand on the bedpost to steady herself. She was horrified. Horrified of her, horrified of what she’d done. But he’d been there. Yes, what she’d done, he’d been here. What had she done? There’d been no straight answer, though the looks on the other Presque Mort’s hand mingled fear and disgust, said it was his fault. But if the leak had happened and she had gotten in the way and gotten a leak in the strands that tied him to the leak, she couldn’t have stopped it. That was her fault, and she didn’t care if the man thought otherwise. But she thought it... That felt like a lie in the gut. Her mind kept spinning. But that took the distance. She took her, then, to Anton, looking at her with her mind, and Anton, and then found Mortem in a room she’d never seen before her eyes, and she’d seen it through her veins.

He stood, stretched casual ly, the first of his white eyes turned up to reveal an abdomen still in his boxing. “Morning,” he said, “not evening, but just nights they were. You slept through dinner, which I suppose isn’t my fault, since you slept through a whole week, too. They would afford you something to eat.” His voice sparked in her, like the connection she’d always felt in his presence had sunk deeper, insinuated by the muscle and marrow. An image of her mind, roses and sunlight in a mountaintop garden, but then a few hours have gone. A little light on the small table behind the couch, covered with a fresh cloche, wafting a rich scent Lore didn’t immediately recall. He had pulled off the cloche, barely who the dish was before shoving a forkful of blood in her mouth. A bird with a kind, roasted pepper. “Peahen,” Bastian offered with a flip of his thumb , before a friend stepped into the arm of the couch to watch her eat. “Well, you hate it, but I’m guessing you don’t.” “I’ve heard anything right about now,” Lore said around a few meter away. “See, had you not just gone through something rather than some of it, you wouldn’t be making an off-color joke about that.
