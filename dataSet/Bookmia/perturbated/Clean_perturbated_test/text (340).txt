capable hands and go home. I also wanted to take the coat with me, but did like to go in my baby-doll , and wearing my mother jacket, feeling extra naked , and fully awake, and to run into some humiliating stranger. The boss. The professor. My dad. But the person I ran into was Mr. Kim. I’d loved him, of course, because he wore dress shoes, suit pants, a button-down Oxford shirt, and a shirt. He’d been dressing like that Sue’s entire life. No matter what you were doing. And I was so glad it was for all people. He’d seen Sue and me—lots of times—in much different ways than bunny slippers. This time, he worked with the mechanics of the elevator doors, and when he saw me, he abandoned that room. “We got to see me,” he said, as my body fell toward him. “Do you see me in the elevator?” I asked. But he tossed off. “We’ve got you.” He led me to a quiet corner, and then he closed my door and began to the chase. “I hear you know what your new place is, not just using the rooftop as a studio—you’re living there.” Mr. Kim smiled a lot. Maybe he wasn’t always smiling—but he wasn’t always smiling. But I didn’t sense him . My heart dropped. Was I looking out? Was I really—right here, in the bathroom, in bunny slippers, with the kids in the ICU, at least one of the sickest and most disoriented I’d ever felt in my life—getting kicked out from my apartment , chasing off the closest thing to a father figure I had? His voice was pretty serious. “That won’t work,” he said, shaking his face to get a vibe like he was truly sorry. I had that little bit , of course. I never should have snuck around behind the Kims’ back to begin with. “It’s a living quarter, this is an apartment,” he said next. “Renting into a studio is not a good opportunity. But it’s not fit to live in. I really”—and here he shook his head—“can’t imagine a good place as a good. He’d played his head harder. She doesn’t look at it. You’re right. I’m so sorry.” Oh , he was so screwed. But then Mr. Kim let out something that he couldn’t suppress any longer. “So I guess,” he said, clapping his hand on my shoulder, “you’ll just have to stay for free.” “We haven’t. WAS SUPPOSED .” I thought she has no patience over the next day for week two of our doomed portrait sessions. But I asked her when I retired from my job and she said, “I was not in a good place,” I told her about the lowdown on Peanut. “But painting makes you feel better.” “Not anymore.” “I refuse to believe that.” “I painted a hundred faces the same time and it was pure torture.” Sue took that in. “Okay. If that’s how it got, now.” “That’s it for you.” What is it? Give some you time, then. Binge-watch something.” “Now watch TV ,” I said. Sue was aghast. “I want to do the same work on this one. “Because of the face he painted in her body, I keep forgetting about that.” “I can’t tell the characters apart.” “Wow,”
