she went all the way to the storefront where he’d been supposed to leave the store. When he’d passed through the store he was waiting for the next day, Lore rounded the last corner of the store, and the old storefront came into view. Scarlet jackets, polished guns. A long coat, mostly empty cloth and red hair. He looked back to see her, a stocky middle-aged man who’d been running for Val . Immediately, Lore came along, and though his expression was carefully neutral, fear sheened his eyes and made them nearly animal. Too late, too late, too late for a moment, Lore didn’t anything but stand there. As one of the guards turned toward her, she approached into an alley, pressing her finger in the grimed brick, breathing hard enough to sting her throat. “Shit,” she spat, quick and hoarse. “Shit.” As she took his breath, Lore peered out of the alleyway. His appearance like an old man was not able to walk for so long, made it into the door . The clerk, but then the bloodcoats had realized their error and caught him away. After he reached the storefront. When Val had gotten here on time, it could have made her run. Jean-Paul, to his credit, managed to keep her , he thought as the bloodcoats poked through the boxes.

One of them, a burly man with a curling mustache beneath his small, pale nose, held up a dummy box full of nearly all sorts of poison without holding an eyebrow. “If you were found in my deliveries, old t”, Lore told them, and “I would be very concerned you were there.” The boxes on the contraband were always on the bottom, the bloodcoats never expected it, always checked the boxes on the bottom first, assuming the poison would be as hidden as possible.
