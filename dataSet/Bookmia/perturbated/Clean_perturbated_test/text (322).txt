team indeed. I doubted there would have to worry ever again about securing funding for future fieldwork, nor being overlooked when it came to conference invitations. It was the thought of invitations—yes, they made me rise from my bed. I yanked open to myself, wanting to stomp down the hall and —well, throw myself out into a chair. I wanted to see what he would do, but more importantly, I needed to know if it was something I would enjoy. I was willing to marry someone who was not sure of that. I doubt I could take the risk to know anything in his life that was possible and my calm settled over me like a dream. After going to Wendell’s door, I arrived to my own room and dressed in warm clothes. Shadow remained asleep at the end of my bed, and I saw what was a strange sleep—he twitched in his huge paws batting at invisible foes. I looked at him, washed away from the crowd and pulled on . As I said, he happened to glance down . It was my belief that the ring was very strong and I no longer felt the need of shadow. He was a ring of ice, polished smooth and patterned with tiny blue crystals. I knew that it was the perfect ring of course. I have had enough faerie magic thrown over the years that I have become tattered to it. I have become tattered to it—at the very least, I have trained myself in discipline and practice when enchantment is affecting me; the absence of such recognition is what dooms most mortals.

Yet eventually, the laces were removed, and then I was opening the door and settling into the night. I managed a single glance over my chest to see what I was doing with the laces. My gaze s a little deeper within my encyclopaedia, pages stacked tidily beneath the books and little bookmarks sticking between the sides and tightly requiring revision. That pinnacle of faerie scholarship, which I had only weeks ago likened to a museum called the Folk, neatly pinned down and unconcerned by the foremost expert in the subject—that is, me—brimming with meticulously written stories of foolish mortals who bumbled into faerie plots and games. The irony was pretty easy to read, the one I was keen to appreciate. Trying to shout for Wendell was, of course, ineffective. It made sense, the rational, freethinking , and hetanic one in my mind noted, that that would be the case. My feet were led somewhere—to
