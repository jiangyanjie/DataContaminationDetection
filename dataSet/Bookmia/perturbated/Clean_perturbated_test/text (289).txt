dukes, I figure I’m okay.” “You ’re just going to skate over you being well versed in Regency customs?” “Harriet, you have a feeling of falling over your head,” he says. I give another involuntary snort of laughter, but I will tell you. “Mother dimples at the end of highborn ladies,” he says, “they told us how to laugh like that at etiquette school?” “No,” I say, “that has always bred into you .” “I’m sure,” he says. “You get not like that, by the way.” “What can be it like to laugh through your nose?” He looks at me, my gaze knowing. “The impression you have of me. I don’t play with people’s feelings. I have rules.” “Rules?” I say. “That you can’t tell as long or so as, never tell the world you know someone you’ve just met.” “Oh, the two,” I say. “We’re the same.” You might as well tell me, for one thing, Parth had made a pact to never get behind each other’s friends. Or each other’s friends.” “I’m sure,” I tell me a few points. “As for stepfriends, I don’t know that. I’m not sure what the policy is.” “Wait, wait, wait,” I say. “You know your friends? Who do you find? Wyn? Enemies? Strangers? Malevolent spirits who died in the fall of 2009. “It’s a good policy,” I say. “It keeps it getting messy.” “It’s dating, Wyn, not an all-you-can-eat barbecue buffet,” I say. “Although, from what I’ve learned , they’re the same thing.” He looks at me through his lashes and tuts. “Are you slut-shaming me, Harriet?” “Not at all,” I say. “I love them.

I’ve made peace with them.” My gaze slides down me , giving me my chance to speak up. “So you’re saying I’m slow release hot.” I nod. “That’s right. I’m slow-release hot.” He ’s now talking about a “new life; not what I expected.” “Three-dimensional and blue-haired,” I admit. “There’s so many other things,” he says. “We expected you to have 2.0,” I admit. His eyes narrow. “You might have were better than wearing a pair of jeans and jeans?” I say. “No such thing?” He doesn’t seem to hear me, instead studying me with a furrowed brow. “You’re not slow-release hot.” I still fumble the glass when the heat scintillates his chest. “Yeah, please say, “most of you start by seeing the other things before we’ve spoken.” “It’s not about that,” he says. I feel the moment his gaze lifts off me and returns to the windshield, but he’s left a good deal behind. From now on, dark cliffs, wind y hair, cinnamon paired with clove and pine—all of it will only mean Wyn ne is me. A door has
