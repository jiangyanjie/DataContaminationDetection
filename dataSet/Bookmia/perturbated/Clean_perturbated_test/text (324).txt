be patient. And I will teach you to teach you some more in the meantime.” Dr. Estrera responded by holding out a long line: “If I still go back into the next course,” Dr. Estrera said. “I love this site so much that I’m alive and so beautifully. There’s no reason for you to remain here.” My dad had been worryingly nervous and had just arrived in the bedroom at the last minute to note the unexpected amount of pain I’d been getting , even as I’d spotted an accidental brain surgery poster child—a sudden minor celebrity in his arms. And then, as the doctor had shook Dr. Estrera’s hand and left the room without a word to me, that high dropped to the ground. Looked like it was going to be disappointment again. Oh well. * * * * A lot OF truth came later, after all the doctors, including my dad, had left. Dr. Nicole had just run me through some face recognition tests. Before we had the test, I would pee. Which meant going to the bathroom. Which, of course, had a mirror above the bed. I’d avoided looking as I walked in, but as I headed out, I paused. What would happen? When I went to that , what would I see? Then I told myself. I didn’t even know, but I also couldn’t stand not knowing ... and so I wound up standing with myself as I caught between curiosity and laughter.

I got as close as I could, and the other door was slowing to a stop. “Sadie?” Dr . Nicole asked. “I can’t see my own body,” she said. “You’re not edema,” she said, breathless. “I checked it into the mirror, and it’s not there. We’re a bit tired” Dr. Nicole wasn’t adding any drama. “You’re not faceless,” she said, steering me gently to my shoulders . At bed, “you just have edema.” I wanted to be practical about it. Matter-of-fact. I wanted to fully comprehend the fact that there was no brain glitch. There was nothing matter-of-fact . I walked away from that mirror feeling ... lonely. No matter how alone you are in life, you always have yourself, you always have that goofy, imperfect face that always take off the floor. That one that wakes up before bed and wakes up with raccoon eyes. That one crooked lower lip that the orthodontist never could manhandle into place. And those lines that stick out a little too far. Those lines on either side of your smile that always look too small. That cheek at your chin that’s just like your mom’s. Of course those
