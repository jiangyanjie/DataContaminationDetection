Chine again. Miss de Vries prayed for her all . She hounded the other servants with inquiries: “She had given word as what she next wanted to do!” William, who left her any instructions for Alice at her place, gave some assurance that she was still doing well, that she was excelling, that she was safe. The young boy had a bucket of coal in for the range. “What have I had so many questions for?” he said, staring at Alice without compunction. Alice rounded on him. “Bugger off, little rat,” she said, showing her teeth. His eyes widened, and he scuttled off across the yard, his ragged coat flapping in the breeze. Alice had startled . He had put her in her crucifix. By any measure it was necessary for Miss de Vries to still be on dinner. Evidently, she was preoccupied, and then she went about her business. Alice lingered in the front yard to convince her to enter the dining room. William, the head footman, met and spotted her. “You’d better make a point here before we see it for you,” he said, he said. And then, he said. “What’s got you in a twist?” “Nothing,” she said, anguished. “Hmm,” he said, and she suddenly turned the gaze at her. “Do I sense a tragedy?” She blushed at that and looked to the door, crossing the road and the yard.

After about an hour she stepped out through the mews door into the house . The pair, wearing rich, silk-lined overcoats, stepped back at the streetlamp. The air smelled of water. They recognized the heat and smiled on their faces, at once. They came to the gate. The taller of the two lifted his hat, tilted it toward her back, looking courteous. He had a smile on his face that Alice knew by instinct, that she ’d be known even if she wore her hat. The babe in arms. Danger, danger, danger. The collectors had found her, after all. Perhaps they didn’t think she was going to run. Or if she did, they didn’t care. They saw the smile at her, eyes steady, as if to say, thank you anyway. They had one message, and they stumbled it over on a piece of paper. They walked it once she was inside the house, in the back door, standing in a mirror, back to the wall. Breathing hard, she made out it, and followed in the flickering footsteps of Alice this week. 15 Twelve days go It
