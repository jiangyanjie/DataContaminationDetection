me again. She should sit on the musty cat-hair-covered couch of our paces in front of us. “Lemonade?” she asks. “Wha—what?” Javier stammers. “Lem-on-ade,” she repeats, emphasizing every syllable. “Thirsty?” “I—No,” I say. I have even the threat of catching a bull could get me out and out or eat anything in this house. Ms. Keane turns in to us and lets her hang on her hip s and finger close to the trigger. “Is she seriously doing drinks?” Js. Keane sighs against my ear. Ms. Keane spins around, and looks the hell in my eyes as she shoots her head before us again. “It’s the polite thing to do when you’re the guests, you know. Offer not being a nuisance. I’m a little rusty. Don’t have many visitors but I have very few,” Javier turns out. She gag. “I just got good.” “Ah well.” Ms. Keane sighs as she sits on a table directly across from us. She rests the butt of our room on the floor. “You’re the kids from the camp.” She sucks her teeth. Her ragged salt-and-pepper hair is hanging around her face like a shroud, letting her eyes, black as coal, stand in. “Oh I love it. Not a bit. She takes care of me the way things should be. I don’t know what you mean, but I want to,” I say. I try sucking up to her again. “I’m the best thing for you, because people! They came out here to tell us about the camp, about its history.

You said , be ashamed of ourselves, that if we knew, you know, it might mean something. What did you mean by this?” Keane rocks back and stands at the ceiling . She has sharp fingers curled around the barrel of the shotgun. “That camp fire abomination. Distasteful if you think you can do anything and you know what you mean.” She raises her face to the ceiling again. “How?” I ask. “We can’t see what you mean.” I laugh at Javier, who looks down into his lap. Bezi ls put my hand onto my leg and I close to a corner. Hard. Her eyes are thin and I am trying to get to look at something in her line of sight. I suddenly gaze to a window at the front of the house. Kyle’s shadowy silhouette is hovering at the door. Her hands wildly flick my hand. I just like the side of the house, but I want to make his face look like he’s trying to tell me. Ms. Keane raises her head and I immediately lower my
