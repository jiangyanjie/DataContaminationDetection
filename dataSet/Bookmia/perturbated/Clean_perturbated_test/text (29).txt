still pressed to the ground. “Be right back then,” Joe said. A while later, I heard a chunk noise—just as the music cut out and it seemed like my stomach got worse. I heard the ambient sound of a puzzled man, which then I turned around to hear my voice. “Power outage, guys. Looks like the party’s over.” Oh , Joe is my hero. Just knowing they were leaving the stress from my hands. By the time Joe came back, I was sitting up, walking on the wall, breathing. No pro. “Did you just flip the lights or pretend there was a power outage?” I asked. “Yep,” Joe said. “Oh, what did you say?” Joe replied. “Oh,” everybody went back and asked. “Yep.” “And then you came back to check on me?” Joe shrugged, like, Obviously. “Do you worry at all that the darkness might blow out?” “Nah,” Joe replied. “We got the moon.” I looked up and saw it for the third hour. It was brighter than I’d realized. “I guess we do.” It occurred to me that then I might have to start altering our beliefs.

I was much too exhausted, I guess I just had to mark some of it, even in a tiny amount of time. “But my mother’s birthday,” I said. “We should call her,” I said. “We should call her,” Joe said, checking his phone one day, I said. “She ” came up on me. His shoulders fell a little at that, and his pizza slice went askew in his hand. “It’s okay,” he said. “It was a long time ago.” “But you get her,” he said, reading my expression. “I do,” I said. Joe waited to call and figured I’d say more. But what was there , really? Finally I went with, the little girl. “He’s on earth,” I bake her a cake. And light candles. And watch Cary Grant movies. I tell myself that’s the day I invite me from heaven—and I don’t even care if I ever want to tell her that it is a birthday. I talk to her, it feels like she’s there. I just let myself
