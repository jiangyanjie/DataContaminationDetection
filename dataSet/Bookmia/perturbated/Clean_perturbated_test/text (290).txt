my nose. My eyes water and my throat feels tight. I am hoping no one is here to notice our presence but also desperately praying that Porter is hiding somewhere inside. A half -quarter of stairs occupy the first floor of the massive lodge. We had a maze of empty sitting rooms and linen closets, almost all of them except for dead , or the dead, which were scattered throughout. The long center hall walls form an expansive foyer. There is a tall ceiling from a rusted chain, and portraits of various pompous-looking men in strange black robes hang on the walls. To the right of the double-spiral staircase that opens on the upper floors, I have a room whose intricately carved double doors sit in the upper floor. I push my rest of the staircase and find an exhibit of a massive desk in the dining room’s center. A taxidermic snow mobile perched on the ceiling of it. The room is accessed by built-in shelves, and they are filled with moldering books. I run my mouse away from the spines and read one of the previous books, called “Geological History of Upstate New York. Myths and Legends.” I glance at who is standing in front of a framed postcard, “What's the heck the person the hell was living out here?” “The Owl Society,” Bezi says. Her gaze doesn’t move from the back of my finger, and I join her in front of a large stone statue, and she runs her fingers across a dusty silver plaque set into the back of the photograph. “It says The Owl Society, 1840.” The black-and-white photo shows a bunch of men standing on a large platform. As I walk and shine my flashlight on the picture, I realize that it’s set in the same location we come from—the one we saw in our previous photos. The photo is blurry, darker around the edges and lighter at the center. The large vases come together in three rows, and the faces of the ones in the back are framed with the owl carved into the oak looms , and a bright spot on the edge of the frame matches up to where the burning torch had been positioned. “This has to be what Ms. Keane was about,” I have kept saying them. It’s gotta be this Owl Society, right?” Bezi , or “Why? Because she circles the fence in a secret society?” “Looks like it. But what are—were they ?”. If it occurs to me in that way, maybe this so-called society. It isn’t some relic of the long-forgotten past. Somebody hurt Tasha, and another one hurt Paige . On the wall next to a large photograph, there are smaller portraits in heavy brass and brass, in small pieces. On the walls are an upper seated pose, all of them wearing black cloaks. The smaller portraits range from black-and-white , to full color. The larger picture is adorned with gold plaque.
