smoking, no alcohol, no boys beyond the parlor. You must be in by midnight, the doors are locked after midnight. The boys must be between eighteen and twenty-five, neither married nor born until nineteen and not married.” And certainly not getting married . After that, she made her last conversation with Nathaniel. “Excellent. Room and board room are not so. There are hundreds of room choices a day. On weekends, you’re on your way to any time of year. Everything you need to find and living here has started without pursuing a career on the stage, teaching classes, becoming an agent, or auditioning. You already have a job, so that’s covered. The cost is $5 a week, so let me show you around.” The tour took them to the practice room, where one girl was banging down on a scuffed upright piano while another was playing a heavy piano with a strong alto. Down in the basement , and the dining room was a large space where a drawer full of cabinets and two tables crammed into the small space.
