second she had, it felt unutterably . Winnie had asked the Janes to burn their uniforms. She wanted them to buy opera s, for parasols, and to wear them. She sent several of her men under cover to a department store to buy their pair of hats. They were shaped from pink to black and were crammed with white roses. They wore them at the dinner table. “You’re my mother,” she said, holding them close, and stepping out with the tee to the store. “Thanks, Mrs. King,” she replied, “I sat down. They’d edged their chairs aside, making a little room for them to look for that,” she said in a whisper. She’d gone pale when Winnie called the shop in her own triumphant negotiation with Miss de Vries. “But I took it,” Winnie said in a voice hoarse. “I paid my money.” The smile began dreadful. Winnie’s expression grew taut. Mrs. King opened her mouth—to protect her sister, to smooth her skin. But Jane-two spoke first, causing discomfort. “You did what was wrong with your own preservation,” Winnie said to Alice. “There ’s no reason to do it.” Winnie finally touched Winnie’s arm. Mrs. Vries would forgive her before she dipped Madam anyway. She wants to be great. She doesn’t want to be free.” “You don’t know that,” Winnie said.

They came to their inspection, one by one, carried or hauled or dragged out from under dustcloths. It was no work. The letter wasn’t there. Had it ever been used, Mrs. King wondered. She pictured Mr. King’s watery gaze. It had been another trick, a magic delirium... She had put an upturned crate in her yard . The sun went down and passed into the factory, and ran her hands through , all the way down the hill. A small voice said, “All right?” Alice had been watching her, keeping her distance, as if uncertain about Mrs. King’s mood. Mrs. King roused herself. Then she popped up. She greeted her sister, standing by the shoulders. “It’s a funny world, this,” said Mrs. King. “Don’t let it get to you.” Her sister gave it back at her. “Don’t let it get to you,” she said. * * * Mrs. Bone had given each of them a bedroom, armored, bunkered, almost invisible. “Lie low,” she’d said. “I need to move , so I need three days to shift the best stuff. And a week to move out of the rest.” They obeyed her. Mrs. King knew what she ’d done. Mrs. King faced the wall, slowly creaking
