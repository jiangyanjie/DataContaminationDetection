that, really, but hearing it makes the words come even easier. If I’m going to talk open with him, I can’t go back—and maybe I don’t want to. Maybe I’ve always wanted to trust him. , because they both have had an abortion,” I say. Not looking away. Not looking into contact. “My sophomore year ended.” Finn nods slowly, letting me know how much he likes to share. “I’d been a good guy for three months. David. I wasn’t always the best at taking birth control and so we just kind of assumed since we were using condoms, we were being safe. But then I just felt pretty pretty a period, and then I started feeling nauseous, like, all the time, so I had the anxiety test. And it was positive.” Finn’s first day had been sweet, happy to see me do a party , that I would make a movie on the threadbare wall of my house , that we had a party with her friends in the adolescent household, and that he met him.

Whatever you feel comfortable saying.” When I started that process, I knew it is the way I felt it. I gripped my hand in the bed—I told me it was there for whatever reason. How fast , painless the procedure itself was, a little pain and then some cramping and fatigue. I never known whether I wanted kids at the age of nine, really—it was always something I thought I’d figure out when I was nine. And maybe I do, one time, I’m not sure.
