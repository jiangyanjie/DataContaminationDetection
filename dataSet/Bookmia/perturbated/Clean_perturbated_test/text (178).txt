, he grew apart . ... “Wyn and I fell in love with that. I can’t hear out any louder than a whisper. “I pushed him away the first time I did to the rest of you. And it was always about the friendship of you or anyone else.” “But it’s not just you, Harriet,” Sabrina says. Cleo touches her hand. “Things have been . . complicated for me. That’s all.” “You know,” Sabrina says, watching a butterfly pirouette . “I was really, really happy when I was a kid. And we were happy. And they weren’t. And when they separated and moved on . . it took a while, but they both found happiness again. Or, you hear semi-twisted versions of how it works.
