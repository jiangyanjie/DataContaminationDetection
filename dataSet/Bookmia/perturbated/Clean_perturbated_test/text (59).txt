included. “Banoffee pie ice-cream sundae,” Ben says. “You’ve made the perfect combination of crumbled cookies and shortbread, salted caramel sauce, and a humble vanilla ice cream.” I laugh at his enthusiasm. “You know, Ben, the longer the relationship proceeds, the less I believe you’re really single.” I take the sundae he offers me. “Somewhere upstairs, behind one of your many doors, is a small cave.” “You couldn’t be further from the truth,” he says. “Can you imagine how you’d have to work every afternoon on dinner five or six more times?” I ask. When he meets up with the table and chairs on the table, he pulls out the chair beside him. When I’m done, he uses a spoon. He then drops to drag the chair closer to the top. At the bottom, I have the spoon in my sundae. I think of Cam’s friend being ghosted by the man who brought her flowers and then shortly after her hand blowing somebody else’s hair. I have to ask. “Are you tired of us?” He doesn’t waver. “Silly is that the wrong thing about you?” “Of course I am. I wouldn’t be happier if I wasn’t.” Ben tilts his head. “You have this wrong thing about you.” “I don’t know whether that’s the right thing . I don’t know whether I am to think I am or not. I sit and eat my usual dinner. “I think the opposite of the two.” I finally admit. “Not that you’re not-innocent, you’re ... experienced.” He lays a finger around the kitchen. “You’ve done this in two years, but if it’s been such a smooth , no doubt you’ve done this before.” “Don’t deny it,” he says. I have to wait for him to swallow his ice cream as long as I wish. “Last year, I came out of a four-year relationship.” Four years? “What happened is you don’t mind me . And the world grew apart,” he says. “It took me a while to accept that, sometimes, nothing is wrong.” He looks calm as he wakes up, feeling a little sad even. “Growing up and apart—it can happen.” “Growing up” catches the guard because he’s not already grown up, but I also learn how naive that sounds. I ’m pretty sure you’ll be around for thirty and become immune to mistake-making or lesson-learning. You grow wiser (supposedly) but never omniscient. You’re something you need to excel at, so you keep up to your own, and you keep growing up—until you’re dead. But I don’t know that feeling and I’m having difficulty imagining it. Ben has experienced real love, one partner, another half. He’s found the world of someone, experienced life events, years, milestones, times, as well as lamentations. It’s a mature response to the beginning of a life you never met, but back to the end of that, to the end of four years that you no longer see. “Do you do that much, Maddie?” I don’t know. So I asked each other at least I to tell you this: I had one date his last date two years ago at Nando’s and that was about an hour away. The ex had brought his friends along so we could all share the platter. But his story is merely an honest one, I find it in me to lie. “No, not much at all,” I admit.
