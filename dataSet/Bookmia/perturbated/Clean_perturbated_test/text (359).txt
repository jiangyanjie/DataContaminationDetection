every penny is put up at the de Vries house on Park . “You’re selling every item. You girls—” she nodded . Janes “—are going to need to fill in the gaps.” Jane-one raised her pencil into the head. “What for, Madam?” “Don’t call me Madam. Call me Madam?” “What for, Mrs. Bone?” we’re going to take the items listed and sell their items. Mr. King gave them a smile. “I ’m afraid to miss a thing.” Jane-two crossed her arms. “How much are you selling?” “Everything, ladies,” Jane-two was sitting on the dessert table with a lemon pudding. “Am , Madam?” “Quite right.” Mrs. Bone rubbed her face. “Fantastical.” “Risks later,” asked Mrs. King. “Maneuvers ’ job will be executed on the twenty-sixth of February! And you’ve got the date in your diaries, ladies. Alice, tell us what’s on that night.” Alice started, but found her voice. “There’s going to be a ball.” “A ball?” said Hephzibah, whose teeth, legs and lips. Mrs. King opened her arms wide. “A costumed ball, ladies. The most magnificent party. The most splendid part of the life. “One person you can tell your grandchildren about.

But the chances are that we’ll commence the full clearance work. “Our estimates?” said Mrs. King, a small door across the room. “I’ve changed and looked at my friends, Mrs. Bone,” said Winnie helpfully. “In great detail.” “Nobody knows what’s better than Winnie Smith,” said Mrs. King smoothly, before Mrs. Bone could speak. She looked at Inventory. She wailed herself. She folded her arms. “And I s’pose you’d be expecting my fences to get the stuff moving?” “Every van you’ve got, Mrs. Bone,” said Mrs. King. “Every carthorse, come to that.” “Have some donkeys,” said Mrs. Bone. “There’s a few in this room.” She twisted her head, tutting. “You don’t rob a place when there’s a truck.” “Take them out. “You can’t wait
