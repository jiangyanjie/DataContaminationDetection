... the words in her. From her handful of letters to Roman’s, she said, “You.” Roman sighed for her. He drew a deep breath , saying, “Me.” Iris smiled, a moment later how excited she was. She felt like laughing and crying, but she forced them both down. Her head began to ache. “All this time, you were receiving my letters?” “Yes,” Roman replied. “I learned my heart so far , I know, I can’t believe this.” “Why? What’s so hard to believe, Iris?” “All this time, it was you.” She blinked away her hand, tossed one of the letters onto Roman’s bed. It was satisfying, to hear the paper out.
