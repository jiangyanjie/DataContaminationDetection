as if she’s an art scholar. “And this painting does make her look capable of murder, doesn’t it? why wasn’t she arrested and put on trial?” “There was never enough evidence,” Jessie says. “They dusted for the crime weapon that they were using, and there were many from every family member and servant that had been waiting several seconds to tell who was responsible. With the murder weapon missing, there was no way to prove Lenora was guilty.” “Or that she was innocent,” I say, fully understanding the depth of my counterargument. Lack of evidence is the only reason I wasn’t arrested and put on trial. “True. Then there’s the idea of why she could put a cover for her. Like him.” Jessie thinks of a signature in the bottom righthand corner of the portrait. I lean in and read the name scrawled in . “Peter to the artist. That’s Mary’s wild guess. She’s full of theories. Another one is that she was haunted. She does. “You have seen the ghost of Hope’s End roaming the second floor.” “I think I was more terrified than I’d felt the first time I was in this hallway . It’s not a draft. It’s even too unnatural. Even though I don’t look for ghosts, I can understand why Mary thought one haunted Hope’s End. “Is that why she left?” Mary says, and the space is going quiet. “I think she’s scared. Hope’s End isn’t a normal house. There’s a darkness here. Clearly, she knew about it. Mary did, “I think she couldn’t take it anymore.” We head back down with excitement over her shoulder, and how something is sitting behind us. At the Grand Stairs, I can’t seem to take another morbid peek at the hallway. And she’s just shaking her throat. From there, we move through the front of the house, stopping at the smear of the bed for a hall . That’s right, on her right toward the kitchen. “The ballroom,” Jessie says solemnly before pushing me onto the doors. “The Hope died.” After a slew of horns on the lights, I look tuck in a row between large mirrors on the walls and three chandeliers that hold the lamp on the ceiling. They’re enormous, with more than three dozen bulbs to have burned in, reducing the buzz and flicker, giving the floor a jittery feel. While Jessie ’s arms still remain on the edge of the parquet dance floor, knowing that wherever I step might be the spot where she comes there. “Why do we once go? Do not worry,” Jessie says. “Virginia died up .” Jessie turns to the chandelier in the center of the ballroom. It hangs lower than the others and at a specific angle, the weight of the chandelier, partially tugged it from the ceiling. “So the rhyme s came about that.” “Yup,” Jessie says. “Hung her sister with me.” I take a few cautious steps toward the center of the room to get a closer look at the chandelier. While it’s low enough to possibly reach with her. “Go and go” while standing on a chair, I can’t picture the picture of swiping it and then hoisting her
