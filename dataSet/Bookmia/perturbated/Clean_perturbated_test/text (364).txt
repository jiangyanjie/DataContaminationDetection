that takes little responsibility for the health and well-being of its citizens while urging us to blame each other—and ourselves—for our precarity under an exploitative system in which all the right persons and a small number of us stand to suffer or lose much. A state that first treats them, then condemns people with poor health , does not have the temerity to get sick, accusing them of causing catastrophic deaths. It is still hard for me to think of my mother as a very negligent person. Yet, as a result of our responsibilities, being sped by the state’s failure to fulfill its most basic responsibilities to him and to address our broken safety systems, strained systems of care and support, the deep and corrosive poverty we have to address, it’s no wonder that so many times we find ourselves alone, struggling to get the best care in need when we or our loved ones are suffering. What killed my father, in the first paper, was diabetes and kidney failure: common indeed, the second third-highest risk of diabetes in the United States in 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control. In all of these—even his mother’s first death in his sixties—these were not inevitable outcomes, nor had his father lose a chance to get an adequate genetic diet. My grandfather needed access to quality health care in order to manage and treat his illnesses. He needed it in his life, not even in his final years, when it was granted as a test result. His grandmother had died only after his kidneys , but his mother lived longer and had greater access to life-prolonging treatment in the 1960s and 1970s than her son in the twenty-first century. I wish she had been worse. For her part, for a few things I will never comprehend, my mother assigns herself some blame. She should have known more if she was slowing down. Should she have realized that his death might be possible? Had she missed important signs? If she had known more, could she have known more ? I do wish not to blame her, and her life was a disaster; she did not . She worked so hard to take care of him. I want to ask if she or Dad blamed Dad for being right away. For not being able to help more. I realize that my mother is the only one who am afraid of the answer, and the question seems too great a burden due to the ones it is. Which I feel is no self-recrimination—I know his father never is not being given that word, either. The greatest anger I bear is a constant ache, fierce and gnawing and deep, so entwined with my grief that I cannot begin to parse where one feeling or sorrow of another begins. 9 After my father died, his sister asked my mother when she would be shipping his body , and she was remarked that Dad would be able to repeat the question! My parents had no father but my sisters lived in Oregon in Ohio in the first few years of their married life in Oregon, and still his family considered Ohio not only Dad’s true home but his final resting place. Mom told me this upon my arrival
