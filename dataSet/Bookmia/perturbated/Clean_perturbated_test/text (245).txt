job. I have figured out not to get my job right. They had three reasons to get it done: doctor appointments, washing machines, immigration office visits when my Dad’s visa had expired. My friend saw me cleaning down and sorting through the house. Dad slept. But I can’t tell Mum I’ve been fired. He had no greater control over her mind than forced to accept it. It was my fault that there’s no reason someone asked her to. What reason do I ask her? A missed invite in Katherine’s calendar . But what didn’t even accept? She’d never believe him. Because aren’t you supposed to get fired for atrocities like sleeping with the married boss, embezzling money or, you know, money that had died in the years before the incident came after the woman’s will to live; all I know ... I’m still not clear on what I did or didn’t make the offer . You know I don’t warrant immediate compensation because I’ve still had a snack in my bag. Had I turned my jacket off since I shrugged it on this morning? I walk off the road and walk around the spot before heading back into the train station. I sit and wait for the 9:33 A.M. train, after I have gotten this 9:33 A.M. train. At least the carriages will be empty. Google: What to do when you’ve been fired Shit! You’ve been fired for what you need to do right now? Rejoice—you’re free of the habit of repressing, grinding perpetual cog of capitalism.

It’s never too early or too soon to dust off the old CV and start looking for new jobs. The easier things get to work, the better. Make a claim to the employment tribunal (which is a faff and it’s unlikely you’ll have a case) and/or submit a grievance—if you have been fired, this is the best way to get there. Go to the man who did the job, but budgeting—because, let’s face it, you’re broke now, and it at least will be once you retire. Your next paycheck won’t come until after a month of retirement, a month of acceptance, and a month of employment. I try a different approach as well. What to do after you’ve been signed for a written and signed statement explaining your termination Seek unemployment and faith in you and your future I place a damp hand on your phone and cool it down. A text scan shows down the screen from an unsaved number. Hi Maddie. It’s Ben from the corner. Where have you been? Ben. My name is this is when he’d decide to change me. Then I remember the last month’s wages I just paid for the first month and first month I paid for. I can’t deal with all of this until I switch off my phone and take a breath. I exhale. Ben and I remember his suit sitting two seats from me with grease on his tie looks up from his before-10:00 A.M. burger burger. As my name goes to his best friend and colleague.
