no, no. I ignore it, even as I understand all the things that she doesn’t want to tell me. Mary. Her body. Her corpse buried in the sand. The big issue with Mary’s story is that a baby has not died in her death . I heard Lenora’s story when others were here, and found the cover letter would keep her safe. But right now, in broad daylight, there’s no one else at this point. It’s just me and Lenora and an adult. She’s going to finish what she loves. Oh, I’m ready to tempt fate one last time. And Lenora’s going to be along the ride whether she wants to or not. I run back into my house, take the service stairs two at a time, and burst into Lenora’s room. After clearing the stairs, I grab a piece of paper and roll it back into the typewriter carriage. Because I use two sides in one room. I take a whole stack, setting the paper on the top of the typewriter and pushing it up the desk. Moving the typewriter down the stairs is harder than moving it to the floor. The amount I take puts more strain on my chin and the typewriter feels heavier than just one step. To keep the piece on top from being buried, I bend , and use my chin to take the center. At the service stairs, I realize I can’t see where to stay. I take each step slowly, taking the stairs from one to the next. At the service, I misstep and knock into the cracked walls, and loose a piece of plaster that is behind the staircase. I crunch over it on my way to the bottom. After clearing the stairs, I shuffle through the kitchen, the typewriter getting heavier and heavier. My chins don’t feel like jelly. My legs do, and as I exit the dining room, I breathe a sigh of relief when I realize I never closed the French doors on my way inside. That’s at least one thing I won’t need to deal with. Tired and heaving, I look at the drudge on the typewriter onto the terrace. Lenora’s there. Not on the grass, where she watches her, but there on the terrace, sitting in her wheelchair and staring at the sea. “How they are?” My voice leaves me when I see them. Carter and Archie, Carter and Jessie. They all stand off to the outside of the terrace, their expressions as well as their personalities. Carter is not alone but looks mildly surprised. The sun is blank. And Mrs. Baker? ? Clearly busted, as the very blank pages come loose and catch the storm. What it’s just like as them swirl and skid over the terrace . Back in flight. Back on the railing. Off the stairs and onto the water. Into the churning water far below. My mother would have died if she slept in her room, a fact made clear by Dr. Walden, the family . It just wasn’t clear how far, whether she drank all the laudanum , or did it on purpose. Everyone else would have died because the reading had to have been accidental. I, on the other hand,
