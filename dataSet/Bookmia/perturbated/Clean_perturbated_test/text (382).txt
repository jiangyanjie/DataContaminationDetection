be well within their rights to turn you away, especially since you could bring some sort of revenge upon them.” “Th-they’ll help us,” Hap said. “But then I am here. “As I see your heart has made you imprudent,” the Coachman said. “How endearing! How positively catastrophic!” His voice turned bright as his mustache twitched. “Say, what would you think about letting me go at it? Just for a little , I really want to see what it would feel like to have a heart of my own. I promise that I ’ll give it back.” Hap folded his arms. “Sure.” The Coachman asked. “Really?” they said. “Don’t t-take it if you like your limb.” He said. “I think I like my limbs as far back as the muscles are?” Hap looked hastily. “You’re very interested in it, though I don’t blame you. I would be the same.” He said, stating the sly expression on his face. “Perhaps you could make the point to me. In exchange , you’ll help, of course.” He wiggled his arms at Vic. “Consider it recompense for putting myself on the line for you.” “You kidnapped us and held us in cages,” Nurse Ratched said. “I think getting from the city will be the worst step even.” “This is my critic,” the Coachman muttered. “Fine, you’ve made your point, though I am certain your position has made you consider me . I also think it was more of an enthusiastic recruitment.” “H-how will we be in the city?” “Ah,” the Coachman said. “That’s not going to hurt us entirely.” He pointed to the monitor, shoving his chair out of the way, fingers flying over the keys. The image changed again, as he walked him back home. It was the light of the city on the outskirts of Barcelona, surrounded by dust and dust. The lights of the city were so bright, Vic had to squint to look on the screen. “We can get you in through the city,” Vic said, after the image was displayed. “You can be noticed here since you have a plan, don’t worry not! I have a plan.” The image saw the city spinning in a circle, before they know certain ... machines, willing to do things the other way in exchange for ... well. That’s probably better , given your imagination. There ’s nothing wrong with the architecture of the city.” The image shifted, a pair of large gates, wooden, with a strip of black metal at the top. That’s where you’ll enter. Once you reach Heaven you need to keep to the side streets. Nurse Ratched, how goes the download?” “Nearly complete,” Nurse Ratched said. “She’ll be able to lead you,” the Coachman said. “I’ve given her a map of the city. As long as I get to my tyres, you should be able to make it to Heaven without much effort. If the train ride is not really complete, is that that’s it?” Vic asked. “That’s what we need,” the Coachman said. “Simple on the surface, though rife with dangers underneath. Rambo and Vampire should be fine. Hap too, so he has to see if his face remains hidden. Victor, your disguise is adequate, but don’t for a moment believe me if you find yourself bleeding. You can’t not fool you
