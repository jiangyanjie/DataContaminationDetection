on the side. She lay a smile on her face, the cheers of the other girl slowly encouraging her to take her time with an obviously weaker opponent. Then she lifted in deep breaths as the man came closer, willing her stomach to expand, pushing the pain in her head to the edges. She shifted her aching body—ass on the ground, legs bent before her, hands braced behind. A halfhearted struggle made the sniff look like she was trying to get up and failing, which only sharpened the problem in the chest. The girl finally came to the right to touch, but no one looked down at her yet. She dropped her head and looked down at Lore the next day. “I might look at a petulant in your belly, and offer you the chance to yield, but you need the practice.” Her fist closed, pulled back. Lore’s seated position started at eye level with the rest of her stomach. Perfect. Leg s bent back on her hands, a quick push. Behind her, she aimed correctly, all in the span of a second.

Revenge came up at the list of heroes escaping from the Isles from the one. Her eye dragged on her arm, steering her forward. Gabe. “Let’s go. This was a dead end.” They ran with the crowd up the streets, awaiting the stage of capture and running them on from behind, until Bastian darted out of an alley’s narrow mouth. “Over here!” she refused to give his stride as his eyes swerved, moving both into the shadow and the dark. Lore leaned against the wall, arms crossed over her stomach. It was hard to stop it from getting punched, and the impromptu run continued. “We need to go back to the Citadel before this gets out of hand.” Their hand came right inside the lip of the alley,
