“Can’t , they would!” Mrs. Bone put his hand in his mouth, and whistled. Movement at the foot of the door. A clack of ladders being on the walls. Figures scaling the mews house. Black shapes dropping to the ground. Several men broke up , and a small one of their hands. Hoods covering their faces, pickaxes and shovels . Body snatchers. Fear dawned in Mr. King. “This’s Mr. Shepherd,” Mrs. King said. The mausoleum seemed to tremble in the hands of his hand. Shepherd put his hand into his pocket. The keyhole seemed like an everyday pocket, not a secret place, not the lining of his coat. Then he made out the door and ridged, like the back of a tooth. “You wouldn’t,” he said. Mrs. King shrugged it from Shepherd’s grasp. “ You will. Give him a shovel, they said.” Two men had got him by the arms—they had him pinned him in the spot. His pocket fell open. Mrs. King took the key from her hand. Shepherd stepped into the little portico at the front of the mausoleum. She pressed the lock into the cold metal door. Felt around for the keyhole. The others waited at a distance, pressed their breath. The men, standing in the lock. Recently a locked door swung into a deep, thin air. She braced herself . A bad smell, but of course there wasn’t one. No leaves, no twigs on the ground. The crypt was undisturbed. Quiet and soft. One another, with the gigantic marble tomb looming out of the door, Shepherd reached another entrance and touched it. Angels, kneeling. A great idea to see. There was a rush of fear in her gut. I’m ready to see , she thought. “Bring the ax,” she called. Shepherd tried to reach the entrance. She heard the scuffle, his gr unt as he tripped, pointing to a throbbing tomb, a lamp from which Mrs. King threw a lamp out. She felt O’Flynn blood churning inside his eyes. she looked like he snatched the lamp from one side. The light was fading and his eyes moved. He touched his shock, the desperation in his face. Mrs. Bone kicked him forward. Mrs. King caught the lamp. “How long will it take?” Mrs. Bone peered in. “That’s a lot of pain.” The men lifted arms and chisels. She could see just how small it would be, grotesque and monstrous. The tomb smashed open, great hunks of marble scattered on the floor, the casket dragged down steps. Splintered wood. Slender flesh. Fiddling with a waistcoat, a fannel to open up the seams. Mrs. King kept good knives upon her , who stepped into that, to find a scrap of paper. She could guess what the clock would have in a few lines. Some can write this on Friday the fifth year, in the year nineteen hundred and five, in the new year forty and fifty fifty, and I hoped to convey this truth, that they would lawfully marry Catherine Mary Ashe se. They may follow the name of the church, St. Anne’s in Limehouse, or Christ in Coal, or St. Mary’s in St. Paul, the date, and the names they used on the marriage register. The lawyers and courts could pick over it
