stack of typewritten pages and hundreds of pills. After that, I run a scan of my bookshelf, thinking the pages were tucked among all the books Mary had left behind, and check it for potential hiding spots. Both yield no results. The last place I look is the closet, since I did a thorough inspection of it the night I arrived. Nevertheless, I check the shelf, wipe out the coat pockets, and check the box on the floor that had once held books but now wasn’t there. I stand, wiping the front door of my uniform, and stare at the patch of dust that ran next to it. Unlike my uniform, it’s not the same dust, as if something had sat there . I noticed that I had been there the first night here but gave it little thought. Now, though, I can’t help but wonder if it had been there as soon as I happened to be there—and when it was removed. I take a closer look. The bag is rectangular, which would be a perfect size for one room on the second floor—and that’s not for the other. I guessed it was something else. While I was carrying a small purse, there was a little roar when we knew the closet, and the box and suitcase are all we call the suitcase. The suitcase was in my head. I grab my suitcase and drag it to the front door. With my breath, I place it over the clean air and hold it up into the uniform—not an exact fit, but close enough. When I lift the suitcase from the closet, I notice that the body amps up my adrenaline , from a buzz to a roar. On each of the pieces on the handle is a tiny piece of metal, attaching it to the suitcase itself. Each ring is about the shape of it, and is the bent piece of metal I am holding on the terrace. I look around as if Hope’s name was finally, and into the ocean. But it’s only me, who made the realization that Mary took a suitcase with her when she left. Inside that suitcase might have been the typewritten truth about Lenora and the night her family died. Now, like Mary, it’s not just a stagger ing wall that has formed between the hallway and down the service stairs. The crack in the stairwell, of the front, has gotten larger. It now runs the entire height of the wall, with a second, large crack coming out of the wall. Another crack has formed, making it easier to reach the opposite wall. At a slower rate, the whole stairwell will be webbed with them. I shudder, thinking of spiders and flies and sticky tiny cobwebs clinging to my skin. In the kitchen, I head straight to the phone and dial the number printed on the telephone as Detective Vick gave me. The n, she says two times before he answers with a groggy “Hello?” “It’s Kit McDeere.” “Kit.” There’s a rustle on my head. The phone tries to track his kitchen clock on his phone and do nothing with the kitchen clock. Just before midnight. “Do you think there is any time it is?” “Yes,” but the phone has some bluntness making it clear I don’t care. “But I thought you’d like to know
