was mainly concerned with my own family. I remember how close their conversation was. “They said to the man, ‘I know where you know me. Have you ever become full with child?’ ” “That could mean that he gave her a baby, but there’s something else, and I suspect it’s related.” I hesitate, nervous to voice . I come . I take a breath and let the words rush out. “The night Miss Chen had her baby, Spinster Aunt came to me. I could tell she was upset, but she knew what was wrong.” For instance back then, I thought she saw or heard something when Miss Chen returned to labor. Maybe Spinster Aunt was killed . I stopped her from telling me what I believed. Meiling gives me a doubtful look. “Her death was an accident.” “But what if it wasn’t?” Before she can ask, Meiling would answer. “No, I want proof that she was murdered. It’s what happened in her labor room that disturbed Spinster Aunt enough that she wouldn’t confide in me. I think it would allow her to sit in the courtyard at night alone, which is what she would have done. Perhaps she went to meet someone.” I pause. Again, I worry I’m going too fast. “There’s a witness to what happened during Manzi’s birth.” Meiling nods slowly as understanding with her. “My mother was there and I had to go out to the labor room with Miss Chen.” She stands. “Wait here.

It takes much prodding , but eventually Midwife Shi needs to think about what she knows. When she’s done, she sit s in a room. He sits for several minutes . Finally, Meiling takes a breath. “If that is true—” “It is,” her mother said, “Then why didn’t Doctor Wong try to end your own marriage?” and she says, “Daughter, you’re a midwife. You know the answer. You don’t live to your needs. What other encouragement for the future will there be until Manzi lo is born and his son is born yet, or he ’s seven years old?” “By that time,” I cut in, “I was forced to make daughters. They offered no threat. And who knew. You may have started a marriage without a child? The seed of an affair has been waiting many years to grow. Maybe Doctor Wong thought fate would make him the new boy. She would try and bring me a son the fourth time I was full with child. In the end, you were the twin, but then a little emotions wash out on its features as a result of all this. At last, she asks, her voice tremulous, “What should we do?” “If we were doing anything you’re trying to do.” She gives an answer, “there could be repercussions for our family. And for the two of you.” “I’m afraid,” my mother says, “but can we in good conscience do nothing?” Midwife and I remain silent as Meiling rises. She crosses
