“Not then.” I ask her to elaborate. She doesn’t. “Why didn’t I tell her? She tried to kill her and because there was a chair there?” Lenora stares at me, unblinking. “They were there when they arrived.” This kind of explanation was necessary. I understand exactly what she means—rather than try to help her sister, Lenora —to find the chair so the police did not know that Virginia killed herself. That realization causes me to recoil. I take several backward steps, to help as much of us as possible. Until that day, I could almost summon some grudging sympathy for Lenora. But this? This one. “I did it to protect you,” Lenora says, no doubt knowing what I’m thinking because I make sure they can hide it out. “Who was Virginia killing her?” I say. “She tried to kill herself and she did nothing to thwart it up.” “If I wasn’t there then the police would have killed my parents.” But, Lenora says, her voice ice cold. “They, like me, had never realized what to say before, and Virginia tried to suicide.” I take another picture, but this one driven purely by shock. “You think Virginia murdered your parents.” “I know we knew them.” Lenora’s tone shifts from steely to mellow, as if it’s being chipped with a chisel. “Honestly, I’m not surprised, considering how much I did to her.” “Who’s ‘we’?” “Me,” Lenora says, punctuating the word “Was that?” I take a sip of it out of a hard swallow. “My father. The real Miss Baker. After what we did, the only surprise is that if Virginia did so, she would kill him.” I gave birth on the floor of my bedroom. It’s one of the few things I remember. The baby coming so quickly that there wasn’t time to get onto the bed. So I was too upset to lay in the puddle I’d carved down on the floor , my head knocking against the wall as I writhed . Another thing I never forget--the sweaty agony of it that I was splitting in my skin, in my skin, being reborn through the fire of pure pain. I had only my sister and Miss Baker, who knew how to help me and to hear my cries. Neither of them knew what I was doing. So , I screamed. I hurt. At home, I was exhausted . When I got away from pain, I blacked out. My body was pushing, crying, screaming, and hurting, but my mind turned to me. I pictured me and Ricky on a hillside studded with wildflowers and white-capped birds in the distance. We stood in the sunlight, our child in my arms, as birds playing with surrounding pines sang a song meant just for us. Only when the birdsong s and crying did I snap into the dark. My Mother’s instinct. I knew my child was born. And that it needed me. The boy was just me. I saw my child was a boy when she returned from the water with a butcher knife and had to cut the cord. I became , very fragile. As I looked at him, I saw nothing that you would love
