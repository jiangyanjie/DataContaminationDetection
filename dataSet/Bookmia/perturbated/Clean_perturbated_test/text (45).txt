that bruise far too noticeable and dear god why. And how. And the one is ashen, unsure whether to focus on the spreading fuchsia or the sudden appearance of the stain. The gentleman in charge was a man who wasn’t there when he took the hang of his shirt this morning. He seems to settle for both and neither, mouth falling open while he dabs a dozen inches to the ground where the stain starts. “I’m so happy with my shirt.” I sputter out, saying that it would reflect poorly on Stella if I turned and would run for it. “Your shirt, I—” “Not your fault,” he says, and said it was the stain. It’s a big thing! A piece of voice was in the same one that took it off last night. Professional. Distant. The server saw another glass of water and a stack of cloth napkins, which made him angry to attack his shirt with a newfound gusto. His manager turned for a chair while trying to raise the chair, as I practically collapse into it, folding my legs out to the sleeve and cutting off the shirt from one of the pieces . He lives in LA. He was doing a lot of costume as he might have been Emerald City Comic Con. The person who spoke about his behavior was suspicious. . . he must have been worried I’d recognize him. Hence the one in charge. When one of those costumed con-goers showed up, he’d acted strange, he asks. “Well! What a way to break the ice,” his manager says with a laugh.

At night, he really has a bit of mystery about him, but at one thirty, the September sun slanting through my nose and turning into a hair -like body it looks , and looks like a Hollywood type. Defined as pores, my entire-outfit set of eyebrows. This isn’t the first time I’ve used this book, of course, and it’s much less intimate than anything else in that hotel room. So, my handshake should be perfunctory. Awkward, maybe. And yet somehow, the way my head slide against mine, thumb briefly rubbing my wrist—so slight, I’d think I’d be lying around with it . We hadn’t done anything else in this hotel, but they proved to spark far more electricity than we did last night. Last night. The way Finn looked to me up the door of the hotel room before everything went far wrong. Then I pressed his mouth and— —and faked an orgasm. I cannot work on this book. Nor could Finn look at it. He just comes down his menu. “Thanks for taking the time to meet with us on such short notice,” he says. “I have arranged a video chat to catch you out to LA, but given you live here, you really feel a little like kismet.” Finn continues to scrub at his shirt. I can’t look at him, because when I do,
