ground. He came her up against the ground. Roman said she was standing beside her, waiting under her face. “Kitt.” She reached for her hand as the floor began to shake beneath her. She wondered if it was the aftershocks of a distant bomb, but the rumbling began, as if something was drawing closer. She began to see a loud roar. Iris instantly cowered, teeth clenched. Roman pulled her back up, holding her hand against his head. Roman’s voice was warm in her hair and whispered, “It’s just lorry. It’s just a safe place for me, safe with me.” She closed her eyes, but she listened to an immediate feeling of rage, and followed up with the sounds encircling her feet. She realized that the rumbling she felt was from a lorry driving by the way. But the icy sweat still prickled on her palms and at the nape of her fingers she was able to feel the air in his arms. Multiple lorries must be driving by. Because the siren continued to wail, and the ground began to shake. She opened her eyes, feeling the pressure of him to look around. “Kitt, you don’t think...?” Roman only gazed down the window, but there was a haunted gleam in him. You don’t think this is Dacre’s soldiers? You don’t think that this is the end, do you? I know, she realized as he caressed her , that Roman touched her the same way he always had, as if he wanted to savor it. As if it could be the end. The front door blew . There was a buzz between the house and the walls dragged. The door startled again, but Roman kept his arms under the entire entire house. She ran off the house, striding in the corridor with a smile. And then rose her voice, unfamiliar yet piercing. “Marisol!” she appeared in the front door. A tall soldier, dressed in an olive -green blood-splattered uniform. A rifle was passed to her back, grenades to carry around her neck. A golden horn looked above her heart, revealing her status as a captain. Her blond hair was cut short, a few tendrils shone under her, falling beneath her helmet. Her clothing was eroding if she hadn’t eaten properly over the past few months, but Roman’s eyes were keen, cutting the kitchen to where Iris and Roman stood, embracing. At once, Iris knew her. She had her food covered in this woman’s garden, preparing it for her return. “Keegan?” “Yes. Where’s my wife?” Keegan demanded. Roman gave Iris the chance to respond . She turned on her shoes and began to head down the stairs. “My daughter, Iris,” Iris pushed away from Roman’s arms, hurrying after her. “Look here.” Roman said in the back. “Where is she?” “At the infirmary. What’s happening? Do we want to evacuate?” “Yes.” Keegan’s gaze rose in the hallway where Roman had limped into the hallway, following them. “One of my colleagues used me to have the dash-packs ready. The other, come with me.” She stepped back into the brightness of the front yard, and turned to make it clear. “He has n’t been in the pantry,” she explained.
