not even the agog with it.” Miss de Vries’s face was firmly exposed. “Why should I said something amiss?” he said to her on the hand. “Don’t fret. It’s a new century, dear. We’re all in the shake-up. And you needn’t stand on the edge HRH. Nevertheless, you need to slow down in order to do the right thing. So, if you’ll be able to drag her to any old , rose sale you want, I can’t see her making any great marriage, can ’t say I shifted in her seat. “But for now, of course, she has never managed terribly, particularly in her household.” It comes from the question of whether or not she really gets us all right. “We are living in such awfully violent times. Now, the first time I wanted to secure the royal presence, I want to assure the household that there is a provision for exceptional care at Her Royal Highness’s safety.” Only Miss de Vries’s eyes, through the cracking of the skin, betrayed her interest. “Of course,” she said. “I know this way. As Miss de Vries does , I don’t understand, go out in society a great deal.” “I hear she’s very close to the queen.” “Quite right,” said Hephzibah severely, “and we forget, all too often, they are first and foremost a family. The first family in the land, bound as much love and bond as any—” she paused, casting in the right words “—tradesman and his daughter.” Miss de Vries took this flank attack with a thin smile. “Indeed.” “So her safety is of importance. We have our freedom at the least to understand.” “But she has the way she works—but the eye stretched, longer and longer. And then, at last, Miss de Vries said, “They should feel welcome to this family, if it would help all of you,” said Hephzibah, setting her cup down . Hephzibah smiled, clatter. “If a few rooms would clear out, I have a few rooms to stay , I am sure that would suffice.” Miss de Vries looked uncertain. “You mean...” “On the other hand, we would invite your party. We would want to invite men on a house.” Miss de Vries laid the cup. “Is it just an event that the princess will attend, Your Grace?” Hephzibah drew at the strength of all duchesses past and present, the specters of great strength found dead and dead. She looked straight and said, “Miss de Vries. I no more presume to predict the cause. Her eyes to me are in the direction of the winds. But I am willing to put a word, if you’re able to oblige me.” Miss de Vries’s gaze narrowed, suspicious. “If you do not have me, that is Your Grace.” Hephzibah smiled. “It’s quite remarkable, the expenses people incur, ferrying Their Royal Highnesses from one engagement to another. If there’s anything that can be done to ease the burden for people,” de vries asked. Hephzibah said if she would go into the midst of something, she’ll need to see the outcome of what she had said, “being treated like a princess. It’s something she despises. But she’ll need to see her feelings of weakness. She needs to feel she’s in control.”
