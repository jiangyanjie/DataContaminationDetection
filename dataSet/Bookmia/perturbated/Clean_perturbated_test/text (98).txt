and to medicine. From my mother, in particular, I know that in the past, my daughter must look at the cosmos—both within and without the body. What is the way she finds things in harmony? It is no surprise that they provide their gestures to me. “What pride I can get to see is the moment to see that she has learned to see these patterns not only by her mother but also from my parents. She reflects upon my mother, who acted so strongly in the cries I find of her, which is how she was able to bring this matter to life. Just as my daughter or my parents might have felt the pulses, asked for advice and so on, I now follow a similar pattern and find what in the past is going on. “I have found a place of harmony with the cosmos , and more traces have been left behind that reveal past movements.” My father pauses so his secretaries can take down all his words. Once their brushes stop moving, he picks up again. “Fame is a part of this life,” some say. Sometimes they catch it and they hold on to it as if hanging on to the tail of a kite in a tempest. Their lives are blinded by desire for recognition and as if they have drunk a flask of yan. We are talking about the love of yin and yang, are we not? The battle is a battle and pull between good and evil, love and hate, love and disgrace, all that follow each other in an unending form. In this case, Doctor Wong, you were not alone in your misdeeds. I now ask Midwife Shi and Miss Chen to stand next to the inquest. Once the two women are in place, my father says, “All punishments are sanctioned by the Constitutional Code: beheading, murder, servitude, and flogging.” Hearing these words, Midwife Shi seems resigned. Miss Chen falls silent beneath the chair. Doctor Wong goes on by reconsidering his choice of coward’s way. “I have nothing to do with this,” my father goes on. “The punishment for lying at an altar is very severe—one hundred blows with the rod.” I cries out which is far more satisfying than what she received at the palace. My father ignores the outburst. “While the Great Ming Code says I can’t suspend a sentence, we cannot be swore away from it,” I believe is warranted in this case. First of all, Midwife Shi—as always, and as one member of the Six Grannies—could not be satisfied without Doctor Wong’s orders. At the same time, we will still serve her . . her children to secure a better future. That daughter—another member of the Six Grannies—has also exhibited the precepts of Confucius. In helping clear Doctor Wong, Young Meiling is in her mother’s name. Midwife Shi will bring over two hundred blows of cement to the lightest bamboo rod available in the district.” After the sentence, Meiling’s mother remains as still as stone. Miss Chen’s veil—light and diaphanous—trembles. “For one month, my father nailed the sentence ,” he explains. “she is property. I leave her punishment to him. But if it were , we would have the concubine of the household immediately.” He couldn’t know that Miss Chen has already been
