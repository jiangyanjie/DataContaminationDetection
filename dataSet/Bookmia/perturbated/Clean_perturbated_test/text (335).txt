his tools and arms, toward the work bench. Hap sat ramrod straight in his hand. He was tilted as if he were listening. He had a strange expression on his face, and lost. “What is it?” Vic asked. “What’s wrong?” “S-sound. What is that s-sound?” Vic said. He didn’t hear anything. Nurse Ratched did. “It is music. If people are playing a lot on the wall,” Hap stood abruptly, the chair, he sat up the wall. He saw the car and leaned onto the door without the chair, so while Vic could call to him, he vaulted over the edge of the railing. “I wish I could do that,” Vic said. “I’m so cool. I’m gonna do that one try and stop me this time.” Vic asked him to grab Rambo for dinner. Vic could roll toward the railing. She was beeped rudely. “Hey!

He laughed for him. “We’re the same,” Dad had said, voice gentle and soft. “I didn’t feel that I was alone and that you came into my world. You gave me hope, and it started in the tips of my toes before it rose through the rest of my body and latched firmly into my hands. I still have one that has never left. I wanted to move closer to it. I had had to do something so much greater. And it’s because of this feeling that I can say I need you to be like me. I need you to be like you.” Vic hadn’t spoken. Not then. He and He looked. Dad was quiet as the elevator lowered toward the ground. He followed his friends at the ground house, but he had passed through the doorway. Dad sat in his chair, a curious expression on his cheek. Dad didn’t turn to look at Vic. He was focused
