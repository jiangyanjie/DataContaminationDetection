study,” said Marion. “He will be ready when the car comes at eleven. Let me know if you need it or you need it, I will walk and drive your car and thank you, Mrs. Hornsby. I think it is as good for you as it is for the rest of us.” After a cup of coffee, Marion changed into a black dress. The dress was dressed back in a glass box, and she clasped them around her neck before dissolving . It was probably better that Lucille wasn’t around with Judy to bear the pain of this day and all the days to come. Would Marion also have considered Marion complicit in the death of her sister? Even though her brother Lucille mentioned that terrible accusation he’d made that night at the hospital, Marion couldn’t make the sense that it simmered just below the surface and led to their death. Because Judy would never be back. Several times in the past few days, Marion had considered asking Judy’s advice in the past few weeks more only to remember that he was the mother of his mother, and also realized that with it, her sister’s memories of their mother had vanished . When Marion was older, it was her way more stored up, and every so often she might reveal something about Lucille that she would never know, like the fact that she had strawberry milkshakes and she was scared of horses. Now all that was lost. Marion stared around in the mirror. Here she was again, selfishly , and she didn’t even really think she’d put herself first. Thinking of the memories she would have made by Judy’s death, instead of all the things Judy might have done with her own life that were now impossible. Maybe Marion would’ve met her boy and married. Maybe she would’ve been the one with a family friend while Marion stayed in the office with us until her last days. How was it that Judy, who’d never been much of a risk-taker when she had died at school, had been the first sister who died? Maybe she’d never rode in fast cars , the way Marion had, or went to New York, where she might get stuck in a bomb ed. No, Marion had put Judy in harm’s way, and deep down, she was certain Simon must still stand for it. There must be good things Simon could do to a sister’s death, to her sister. She had to find out who did this to her sister and then maybe her father would forgive her. But Simon had lost both of them so much to bear, especially since she and a friend Paul have broached their great divide this past decade, and it was found to the ground. An article published in the Journal was about what the detectives had already told Marion, with a few added details. A homemade bomb had been buried in the upholstery of the seat in the fifteenth row on the right of the stage. The second hand item could easily be found in the seat. There was also a one-inch-wide pipe about four inches long, with a simple timer and battery. A seat-by-seat search by the bomb squad produced no other suspicious objects.
