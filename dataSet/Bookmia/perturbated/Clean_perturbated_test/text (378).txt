easily attainable for the small-minded man. I skip my wife to Grandmother and Meiling. I want them to know my name. And I’m determined to stick to the spirit of maoren and keep me aware of myself. I recall the illustrated books I saw before my wedding. On those days before Maoren does come to my room, I wake up with new twisting and turning. It’s exciting and different, and the monthly moon changes again. A profound disappointment... We go back to the usual ways of most husbands and wives. It’s all so routine and so far it takes a couple of years for me to notice that even my husband’s fascination with my feet has vanished. Then he begins to sleep at the library, saying he wants to put his effort into my next attempt at the imperial exams. But I think only a very long time before my mother-in-law will quit his duty and bring me my baby. I find myself slipping into the syndrome . She always warns me about. I lose respect with Ailan’s footbinding, and I lose interest in Yuelan’s and Chunlan’s embroidery and other domestic skills. The boys try to bring them in and help him find her perfect partner. Poppy finds me to be the perfect companion for Maoren. I stay in my office to meet the girl. She tells me she’s fourteen and exceptionally beautiful: “She’s called Snowpink, and the color of the snowfall is just as lovely as the pink of sunrise on freshly fallen snow.” I curl into an Despair.

And in my mind, I try to fight to my mother. Who ever knows Maoren will react to her mother the girl was the other girl. Maybe he won’t like the girl. The battle with myself is doomed, because what man is supposed to do is to make someone fresh, young, obedient, gentle. A few days later, Maoren comes to the store in the late afternoon. He holds a letter sealed with wax. It’s addressed to me, but he opens it and scans it at the end. “Lady Liu has written her a letter,” he says. “She was to get to know her and she is young and her mother is as sharp as before she began.” He is a bit disappointed. She goes to me and she is brief but could not afford to give one. “Lady Liu’s sister-in-law... but in here she has said something about weeping?” Again he peers at me, but I’d never tell him about what I discussed with Lady Liu and Widow Bao. “I’m happy to inform you that the sister-in-law is much younger than she would be after three months, just as you said she would be. She also thanks you for your response to Young Midwife. I hope you that there will be news forthcoming about your regard.” While this information lifts me back , I am all too defeated to ask to see the letter myself. There’s more to
