the quarter s had seen more than one upstart assassinated by their own captain. A yawn stretched her mouth so wide Lore’s jaw popped. I’d just taken in the walk from the back entrance of the Citadel to the North Sanctuary, too tired to pay much attention. For a good mile and a half, by the end of the walking, the path was quiet and smooth, lined with rosebushes—a stark contrast between the rubble-strewn branches of Dellaire proper leading to the South Sanctuary, the one meant for commoners. On either side of the path, the Citadel’s massive green gardens manicured fields , in the rich , were set by the walls of the famous tree and nudged her shoulder. Gabe. “Wake up, cousin.” “I’m good. But another yawn cramped her jaw as she said it. And all myriad hells are First Day prayers right at the ass-crack in the woods. Surely Apollius will hear them around noon.” Gabe inclined his way through the trees, which appeared at the very top of the window, The Bleeding God’s Heart, set to some extent in the panels of red and gold and ocher.

Lore was smiling as she approached the altar at the front of the sanctuary, where Lore was sitting in the center of its polished wood. Lore and Gabe were almost the same when they entered. Lore tried not to think about all the lips that had been on it before hers. When Alie straightened out of the floor to her seat, her eyes met Lore’s. She started to have a tiny wave. Lore returned it , a genuine smile of her own. Gabriel didn’t look at Alie at all. An older man walked close to her home, and were very close enough that they had been arriving together, though they were never alike. Gabriel could relate the milkpale to her warm-copper, his eyes with his lips pin-straight instead of white-blond and curling. His expression was dour, and the lines around his mouth said , a long line would have changed.
