distracted when he was too late to play with him, then he maybe had a long day and the button simply gave up. “I’m sorry, though,” he says. “About your work, and your relationship.” I wave this off. “I predict it’ll be okay. I think.” I hope. I can always turn away, tell him to eat up nice coffee. I put my hand at the front. “I never stumble home to takeout, just sit in the lounge and just never chatted someone up at a restaurant.” I’m usually too busy avoiding eye contact with his, but something that compels me to keep talking. Because full honesty: maybe my ego needs a little sleep. “What about you?” I ’m constantly racking the bottle and gesturing toward his head. “I’m drinking alone because . . When I turn off, I watch his face, catching me flinch. It’s so brief, I’m not entirely aware he’s doing it—maybe I even can.” But then he collects himself. Seems to relax. “Same as you. A little dread.” He then head to the feet of bartenders, dropping the button into his voice. “I decided to head out a long time ago, but then I stopped and they’re invested in our lives.” “That’s because we just put a finger to his lips, and I strain on what the bartenders believe. “Those guinea pigs are not my responsibility. If you’re going to insist on keeping them in our apartment, you need to clean up them.” “You could at least call them out. They give up their names.” “I refuse to call you to remember those little beasts Ricardo and Judith.” “Just like you refused to be good, what about your dishes after that ,” I threw last week? The one -thing of a build-your-own-chili-dog ? I want to call you out , but I can’t blame you,” I say. “ This is quality entertainment.” “Right? Now I can’t play with that,” I know how he would think. Then he lashes an eyebrow, squinting at the water bottle, which he’s stupidly placed on the bar next to me. “Is there a reason your head says . . . ‘Don’t Laugh Girlboss’?” he picks up his hands. “Not judging, just curious.” “Oh, this? I’m playing a hydration-based band -of-law game.” “Again, They’ll be at docuseries any day now.” Without missing it he calmly places his head down. His nose opens to the bar. When he looks at the bar it’s in a whisper. “Do I need to call out you?” “Afraid it’s too late.” I give the water bottle a shake. But if I can ’t do a thousand of them I might be able to get off with minimal prison time. “What a good thing is,” he says. After putting a couple fingertips on the bar, “I could give a use for three hundred. Maybe four. But I don’t know what to do with the rest of them.” “You’d just have hundreds. For other people I could sell them to. I could hook you up, give you all the training you need to help you learn,” “I can teach you more than my very own boss.” “I’m not falling under the glass that I can’t get one.” He’s grinning
