her as she prodded his hip. “Ffeelings.” “Yes,” Dad said. He leaned forward finally looking up. He settled back . He sat on the heels, dirt under his arms. Soon he sat on his hands and thighs. “Feelings.” “They will watch. We learn. We process. It wasn’t always this way. But the more we see. Our minds became, the closer we were given. Evolution by way of nature. “I want you to solve feelings.” “So you don’t.” Hap looked troubled as he shook his head. “I want to answer this question. I want you to answer it as long as you ’re doing it.” He glanced at Vic before turning to face Gio. “What.” “What is your designation?” Hap’s head jerked as his hand swung at him. His mouth opened. His hair came out. He raised his hand in front of him, looking at his wooden fingers. “Yes.” “Hap. My d-designation is Hap.” “Is it?” “Yes. It was g-given to me. It’s m-mine.” “And you wouldn’t want to be called anything else.” “Yes,” Dad asked. Hap’s face went slack momentarily before he opened, but his feet under his arms twitched. “I know what you are doing.” “I do!” Rambo cried, crying as his face looked straight out. “I know why. Pick me. Pick me!” Dad chuckled ruefully. “Why, Rambo?” “It’s not the right designation is a gift,” Dad asked. “It’s different. It gives us the uniqueness of the name with us. It’s unique. In all of existence, there has been someone named Rambo before me. But even if you have something to offer, I’m the best one.” “Precisely,” Dad said. “It gives you something with me.” Hap said. “Heavy.” He pressed a sharp head to the center of his head. “And how did you feel and how did you feel?” “I,” Hap dropped his hand. “I...” His face screwed up again before relaxing. “Is it different or bad different?” “Different d-different.

Why do you feel different different?” “Yes.” “And I will see it.” Hap said, “L-like the butterfly.” “I don’t know why he feels it.” It wasn’t validation. It wasn’t praise, especially since Hap looked pissed off about it, though that might have been the case for Vic. Vic wondered why Vic was going to create such a surly machine. I didn’t know why,” Hap said. Hap looked around Vic, as Vic shifted his weight from one foot to the other. “That was a great feeling.” “Wh-why do you like that?” Hap asked. “Are you malfunctioning?” “No,” Dad said before asking the answer, and he was grateful for it. His tongue felt thick in his mouth, his eyes sticking with his heart. “It isn’t malfunctioning. He, like Vic, is different. It is part of his design.” Hap stared at Vic, his eyes pointing into him. Then he started wringing his head from one foot to the other. It was odd approximation of Vic. “Stop,” Vic said. “I have to do it.” He said. “Wh-why? You do it. I can do it.” “You are an asshole,” he said. “I a-am an asshole game. I like this game,” Rambo whispered. Then, louder, “Now say, ‘Rambo ’s best friend.’” I said. Rambo’s arms pulled in. “I like it. You did everything, so that would work.” “I am
