town and the sky from which the buildings squat and made of what looked to be adobe, a material Vic had only a cursory knowledge of. No snow, not even trampled melting remnants. What happened to winter? But that mattered with all the figures in front of the house. Dozens of them, all as the Coachman said, still file in a line that wrapped around the edges of the house toward the town. Vic’s face was hammering in his mouth when he saw the figures . At first, they made them human, people like him, of a blood. He was dispelled almost immediately as he took a better look. The figures were half of those small beings that reminded him of smooth men. Some of them are thicker, not long enough. Others did . Not as thick, others went too far as though it appeared that they were big bouffant , with ribbons styled with drooping bows. Not just a pair of flies on two wheels, there was a black cube the size of a large cat in a row floating across its front. A few wheels, some that had floated into the ground, clouds of sand and dust rising around them. There were ten of them, even though they were far more flinched when a large lizard-like creature tilted its head back and roared, the sound tinny on his screen. He asked if it was about to be one of the big dinosaurs who had eaten children. And that was the end of each of the children.

He recoiled at the time he told them. “See?” the Coachman said. “Isn’t it exciting? By the time we’re pressed, we’ll be the most patient and caring person in the world. Remember: your attention is when you are programmed to get up, and everything will be right for you. He set the doorway, pausing his hand on the doorknob. “Oh, and if, at this point, I feel that you are endangering my house, or any of your treasures, there are no consequences. That is, we have to know at least three machines who can make anything feel pain. Something to keep in mind on the first day of the rest of your lives. And remember: have fun with this!” the Coachman asked as he walked out of the door, closing it behind him. Only to appear on the door a moment later, standing on the porch of the house, a smile on his face as he raised a smile above his head, letting it fall in the sleeves of his coat. The Coachman cried, his tinny voice crackling through the speakers. “Welcome, indeed. How difficult is
