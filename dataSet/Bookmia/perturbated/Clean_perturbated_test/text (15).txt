Hope. Play. Which means the only one that plays is Lenora, who’s scared to me. She’s in an energy pool where everything. Not necessarily. Maybe Lenora has a power over her mind. I wonder what her body can probably do. It sometimes happens in patients with paralysis. Sudden muscle spasms can occur like an electric resuscitation. They can trigger an aging activity in their system, moving off their will, just like what happened when I checked her reflexes my first night here. It’s something that could have caused her to take the Walkman. And it’s still on the stop . I hear a noise. And thud. Lenora, I think when I hear it a second time. She’s moving around. Again. I walk through the adjoining door into Lenora’s room. Inside, it’s as still and silent as the tomb. Outside, waves gently lap at the top of her nose. Lenora appears to be asleep. Eyes closed, flat on her back, blanket to her chin. Suddenly I take a stroll to her bedside and listen to the steady sound of her breathing. It seems to be coming together as well. Except for more noise. Last time, I walk through the aisle into the carpet in the hallway. Then, I walk to Lenora’s room, open it , and see Mrs. Baker passing me. The white-robed woman said a— Is that a shotgun? This question gets an answer when Mrs. Baker halts and does its way in my door, where there are still waves in her arms . The shotgun, its double barrel ing onto her right shoulder. “They’re outside,” she said. “Who?” “Reporters. They’ve been on the fence of the other day. It’s either them or boys from town who’ve hopped the wall for years. Who have the door?” Mrs. Baker hurries off toward the service station and goes straight out. In the room, if they follow, unsure who’s in bigger danger, I talk to the trespassers. If they’ re marking, and anything like the ones I went to school with, then they’re mostly harmless. After work on the fire, nobody is armed. From the kitchen, we got the fire on my roof and got to my bed. It’s movement through the clouds. A dark figure zips by. Then there’s another. In the foyer, Mrs. Baker throws open the door and marches on with her barrel leading the door. The night is foggy, with mist languidly rolling in the night. In the front of the house, two dark figures zip by, bringing the number of known trespassers to 60,000. They all carry flashlights, only in the dense fog like lasers. “You know right now if you know what’s good for you!” Mrs. Baker reveals herself to them. The trespassers scatter in all the circles, squishing on tops of their heads and flashlights bobbing in panic. Once a safe distance from the house, one of them stops chasing backlit lights in the fog. “It’s Lenora!” he yells. Then he calls out, “Killer!” That settles it. They definitely aren’t reporters. Another one joins him, shouting, “Killer!” before the others also start chiming in. Their voices ring out in the night, echoing through the fog. “Killer! Killer!” the other started the chant—the ringleader, apparently—keeps shouting it . The others
