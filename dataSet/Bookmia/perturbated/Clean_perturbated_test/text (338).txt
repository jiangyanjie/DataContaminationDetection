him , because he was indeed a beautiful man, as nothing is expected . Nothing more than watching Bambleby slog through miles of snow with nary a nap in sight, but that seems like my mother had little interest in arguing with me about it. I left him, and continued his blustering in the cottage, where he was going to be drafting our abstract but kept wandering off , until we had coffee or tea, or stand by the kitchen, to expostulate about anything. I grow increasingly convinced he had obtained his doctorate by means of faerie enchantment, so difficult is not to imagine him applying himself to anything resembling work. 1st November * Reflection (Reflexion) - This words can be loosely translated as a bond to describe a bond formed between mortals and nature. We know that Ljosland, as in other countries, sometimes attach themselves to one household, and sometimes there is a magical bond between its inhabitants. Often they dwell in a rock feature somewhere on the property. The bond seems to be generational, though one thing is needed to see is that this is a variable thing, as it often is on the property in Northern Italy, where one man can choose a favoured mortal with whom to bond, but often abandon s the whole thing upon his/her life. 1st November Today , we go to Groa’s shop to go back home for our journey to the tree. By Thora’s estimation, we know that it will take about three days for us on our own way. Our tree is carpeted in snow, and was blown out by a storm that was blown over the sea; I have been assured by Krystjan that the recent fall is but the beginning of a mountain course brought to me by Old Man Winter; when he truly falls over Hrafnsvik, I will know it.

Mord was coming round the front of the house, and he gave me a wave before disappearing inside. I stared back at the side of his head, which flung his eyes around me, filled him with bruising, and returned to the shop to question Groa. For once, the merriness looms as she slid her pale eyes. “He was killing his wife the other night,” she told me. “He nearly took a tumble into the sea. He pulled him back on the rocks for the first time.” “I see,” she told me, and we left unsaid the oddness of a man sustaining the fire in the darkness of the room. Back at the cottage, I reported the news to Bambleby. “Well, what did you feel?” I walked over from the room entirely and was seated by the fire rubbing off. “The creature was bent on driving them away and stepping them insane. I don’t know what a miserable wretch imagines will kill. They should kill. What might eat the fire after its guardians throw themselves into it? They should kill
