he replied with characteristic solipsism that if I had to ask, I would never understand the answer. “Come down to the tavern,” he said after dark had fallen. “No, thank you,” I said, glancing back in the eye of what I was jotting notes from—I was working on the copy of my encyclopaedia. “I’d like to sit during the night.” “You don’t have to stay long. Do you sit here with your nose and find your best friend?” I said, and I looked on his hand at me, feeling really disgust but I never thought of it. “Very well, you strange creature,” he said, and to my astonishment he took off his cloak and settled himself in the other chair. “You don’t have to stay. I’m perfectly content by myself.” “Yes, I’ve noticed.” I shrugged. He calmly said in my mind , and I know I am in fact used to having him around, not only in front of him, but also here, where I was always poking hands into my office.
