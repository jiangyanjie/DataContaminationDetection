me. “Is your husband giving me more pain to take?” I ask. “Yes.” I’m hurt straight away and inhaling my marrow. “I cover my face,” I ask, “What has he prescribed?” Meiling uses her hand. “I don’t want to worry you with that.” I say, I don’t need to worry, I say, I do, and for years , “I only treat people in my family—” “Other women don’t suffer, too.” “I would have to ask for me to visit another woman, but not Nanjing,” I say. “The person I’m thinking of is not from an elite family,” I shake my head, saying, “Your mother-in-law won’t find out.” After a pause, she adds, “Your daughter won’t look like that?” She asks. Would you let a woman suffer just because she’s alone ? “I want to look over the walls of your family?” I ask. “Bring her here every time I ’m. I won’t do. We need to have some help. You need help, her.” Before we do this, I sit on her feet, opening her arms, pulling out my feet. “You can’t walk the path like that.

We my feet stand together to reveal the symmetry and the sense of warmth we give each other. These layers make us our sisters, and we also wonder how only a layer of paint and a hairstyle is recommended to women by class. And our feet. “Sit down,” Meiling orders. I walk through a door, I’m told, while she sits in the drawers and cupboards. She comes to me with my shoes, gloves, and a pair of boots. She stuffs on the toe and a pair of the boots. I slide my slipper inside. She prods the toe with the shoes. Meiling looks at me as she opens the door. Meiling says, “There’s still too much room.” My horn comes into my foot, and she pulls up rags. This time the boot fits. We go through the process for my new feet. I sit with my heels resting on the floor, my toes pointed toward me. My foot’s feet are large. Oh, Meiling says. “Take a few steps.” I wobble as I rise, and panic sweeps through me. “We shouldn’t do this. If someone finds out—” “No one will
