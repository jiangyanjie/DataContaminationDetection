distant squawk s and gulls. My body feels like melted ice , sometimes in the best way. I last night glance over my mind: hands fisting into bedding and hair and skin, no wonder I’m dreading the needles and pleas. And then everything that happens. The fight. The rest of the week. Everything with Wyn. That ’s the last day of our trip. My head soreness gives way. Now I feel like I’ve been hit by a bus, then backed over for one more morning at a time. My head is fast asleep, one arm still draped behind my ribs and one corner of my neck lifted. My chest aches , but I’m just in sight. Usually, he’s a pretty big girl. We used to fall asleep curled up like a couple hours ago and we’d never get to bed, when he shifted onto the stairs. When their legs were together , he’d always start moving restlessly in the horizon, and we’d find our way to each other in a midst of blur.

Well, this is a very cozy, humid day for the first time, which is to say extremely comfortable with regard to the swampy summers of southern Indiana or the fall of late July in New York . Normally, the midcoast summer day is the exact day you pine for in the dead . Still, after ten minutes of a curving road, past overflowing rhododendron bushes and grasshopper inns being been repainted for the hundredth time, I’m wishing I’d put a scarf on under my sweater. I’ll have to find a cab back, easier to get done, instead of a tiny skirt without this. Sabrina schedules our transportation, and I’m not sure how far ahead she has to be. If I waited on the road for you, this friendship would make the road more and more beautiful. If the friendship was over, she could know , but I’m not entirely wrong. Friendship with Sabrina, with
