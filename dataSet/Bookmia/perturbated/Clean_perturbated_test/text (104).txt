Kyle stands as still as a statue, gripping his knife. “What—what do we do?” he stammers. He walks down to the window , looking out at the parking lot. Bezi’s car lingers in the cone surrounded by water emanating from the floodlight. It’s too deep on the ground, so I can see because the tires have been cut. I can hardly think of the wave of rain sweeping over me, where I sit on the stool behind the counter. I’m trying to survive. That’s all I want—to get out of this place alive. I look at Bezi and Kyle, both of whom I have no idea about the game, and clearly scared to death. I see them, while I shift around to the office counter and look to each other. I see the game book sitting open, the names of the guests and staff penciled around the table. Each person is playing the role of a girl yeller who has been a serial killer every night for months.
