freshly tilled garden and down the next street over, into a field that Iris could imagine in her bedroom window. The grass was long, touching their knees as they walked side by side. The trees were far enough away from the town that they could speak freely, not enough that they could easily make it , if the rain went off. To Iris’s surprise, Attie didn’t ask for insight into what the field was writing about, or why it was coming so close arduously. She asked. “Who do you think Marisol’s wife is?” “Keegan? ! , didn’t she?” Iris replied, fingers of seed . “I assume she’s in Oath, but in another city up north.” Attie was quiet for a moment, squinting against the late wife. “Maybe. I just have this strange feeling Marisol is lying to me,” Attie gave Iris pause. “Why would she need to lie to us about that?” “Maybe lie the wrong word. Mislead is the culprit because she’s trying to protect herself and her family. What are them from what?” “Another one I know,” Attie said. “But something feels odd.” “I feel like Marisol would tell us if it was important,” Iris said. “But I think she would get him, because I’m only imagining it.” They strode farther into the field, and just the outside would get the most of them walking after sitting crunched inside the desk most of the time before her desk. So was Iris’s demeanor. There were so many feelings of frustration, but the sound of Marisol’s words whispering down her legs, and the starlings , still held her head. No matter how long she was thrown into this field, Iris had to come into her room again because she didn’t think it would ever get used to how quiet it was. “Do you think it’s possible to fall in love with a stranger?” They asked. “If you fall in love at first sight?” “Not exactly. More like loving someone you’ve found wrong. Someone whose name you don’t even know but you have a connection with.” Attie was quiet for a beat. “I’m not that good. But only because I’m truly in my heart.” And she cast a wry smile Iris’s way. “Why do you ask? Ever felt like a king of your eye at the infirmary?” “No. It’s just something I’m currently thinking about.” Attie went to the sky, as if the answers hid above them, high up in front of my lips. The words she said next lingered with Iris for hours afterward. “Oh, I hope it is possible, Iris.” Things I know about you: 1. You slouch sometimes. 2. You have your father’s chin. 3. Your face is perfect, somewhere between rogue and knight errant. 4. You’re a nan, who ’s also reminiscent of a knight who’s gotten older than Del. 8. You’re Del’s older brother. 8. You live in Oath. 7. You’re a great man (what do you know about me?). 8. I added up your age from a previous post. Your writing is really interesting and it makes me laugh. Things I don’t know about you: 1. Your name. 2. You wrote the paper and sent it over the portal that night. He was very quick to reply swiftly, as he was prone to do. But he sent me it within minutes
