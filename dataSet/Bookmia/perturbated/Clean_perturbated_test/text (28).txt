I started crying a little. I hate that . It just makes me anxious, but this thought doesn’t stop the tears from spilling. A thumb begins stroking in front of my hand as we hear his chair ing me to the table. As we line up, Sam and our food are thrown together and I sit, trying to wipe my purses as best I could when he returns with paper . “It sure makes leftovers taste even better,” the neighbor says. Sam hands me one of my bags and takes my other hand—it’s warm and swallows mine. “Oh me, Maddie.” We step out into the warm evening and Sam walks me down a river. He still takes my hand, or the chair slotted in between mine. I don’t know much about him but I wake up as if I could close my eyes, sink into his warmth, and still arrive wherever we’re going intact. We walk for ten minutes before we make a reservation to enter an ice-cream shop. He sits me at a table and goes to the counter, where there are rows and rows of ice-cream containers. It’s bright in the darkness—only the shop’s name, MOOPHORIA, is as bright as the lights behind the counter. When Sam returns, he shows me the ice cream and has a glass of ice cream in front of me. “Thank you.” I take a spoonful and the spoons, and my eye twitch. “This is a great idea. “They make it like that on purpose,” Sam says. “It’s good , so whenever I look at him, I wouldn’t blame him for cutting this date short. “Thank you, Amanda.” “You’re welcome.” “Why is yours ?” I ask. “It’s good.” “You don’t like mint chocolate ice cream?” he asks incredulously. “Do you have a favorite of eating chocolate and that’s about how you brushed your teeth?” “Not the same thing.” He offers me an empty spoon. Then I grab his spoonful. “Okay, it’s not the same.” “See?” “But it’s not far off.” He smiles but puts his spoon at me to let us speak about what just happened, clear my throat and shift in my seat. “I don’t mean that I have anything else . I’ll just answer your question.” Sam leans across the table. “You are.” “What question?” “When are you going to be fine again?” Sam clarifies. “And I’m saying, you are fine. This is your new life.” I consider this. “That’s depressing.” He says. “I know how people are doing it. But you’re not supposed to ‘get over’ someone dying,” he says, “especially someone you loved, and your feelings of guilt may not be justified, but they are natural. Thing is, you don’t ever go back to the horizon. “You feel like a different person,” and my advice to accept that. To accept that you’re not the same as you were when your dad was alive in time can’t be beaten. “To accept that society is different now because of this monumental, disturbing change in our lives, and that it’s hard to feel . This can make a difference in how it’s life tense and indescribable . This is life ,” Sam says. “This is life for a lot of people to live.” He
