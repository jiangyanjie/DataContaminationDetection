for a few days, Simon looked over at his hand no more, as if asking for backup. Simon nodded , wondering what went wrong with a quick golf trip. After all, where have you seen your buddies , right?” “He went onboard with his buddies,” said Marion. “Moot you not telling me?” Judy, too silent all this time, not even offering up a word of congratulations, piped up from the corner. “You’re ruining everything, Marion. Just be ware, I ’m sorry.” Many of them were ganging around her, but suddenly something was afoot and she wanted to see what would happen on the world. Perhaps she had been there, but she’d just lost her job and was in danger of being. She almost proposed to be her almost-fiancé, and she didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. “Tell me.” “Nathaniel , I wanted to see the city of Florida to collect your goodies?” Judy said, clearly thrilled to spill a bit of the rug again. For the first time, at that time, Marion had ruined the big surprise. She wanted to crawl into the rug and disappear. “I’m so sorry.” Nathaniel gave a helpless shrug. “I was just looking around and looking and trying to handle it.

She hadn’t realized she’d let out a long sigh. “Nothing. I ’m a little overwhelmed.” In a few days, Marion would be getting engaged. There would be a lot of meetings, a presentation, draw up, invitations to order, meetings . It was a long work ahead. Her heart and hearts turned bright and we laughed at the thought of it for some reason. “I suppose your mother was overwhelmed at first as well,” said Peter. “That’s perfectly normal. I’ll tell you what, though, I can’t wait to walk my little girl down .” Her normally stoic father was about to cry, which, in turn, made her cry dark. All her eyes popped blue. She walked past her father and gave him a smile on the cheek. “Tell us again how your Mom met.” A soft smile crossed his face. “I’ve told you that before.” Judy piped up. “If you’re reading a play, right?” The two sisters shared a quiet glance, united with a thirst for reconciliation for their lost parent. “That’s something I have been still getting into working at your office, after years of running for office and at work for a while.” Around
