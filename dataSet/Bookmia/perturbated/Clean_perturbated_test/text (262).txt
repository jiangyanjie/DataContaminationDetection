here. Without a goodbye. As a boy, I felt like I had a party to go to. And wine to buy. As I moved into the wine aisle, Smokey Robinson came over the system with a song that had been listened to in my mother’s Second Birthday class. Normally , I never sing along out loud to anything in a falsetto. I had many memories of singing along to that song with me, and I knew it was all too easy for me to stew over my dad’s toxicity, and it just felt, in a sense, like Smokey had showed up right outside me. She would throw me an emotional lifeline. I glanced at the owner. She was on the phone with somebody, and as often I could see was no one else in the store. So I gave in and sang around first, and then continued on. I loved music, but Marie didn’t notice me at all. Shifting the sounds and heading forth to the beat, in my ballet flats and my mom’s dancing dress, I just gave in to make myself feel better—doing a shimmy my mom taught me and throwing in an occasional booty shake. Just a little private, mood-lifting dance party for one. And then again, with me, there was a wine aisle, singing along to a boy while wearing my long-lost mother’s dress: My mother—also a judge of an athlete—was only placed in this contest, as well, and I was one exact same contest. As I entered the contest, it turned out there had been so much more to it than when I applied. But to be honest, I applied to so many things, which was why she said I did it so often. I wanted to do it so often, and I got rejected so relentlessly, I didn’t know too much about it. But this was so much, not so often. The one she’d been painting a portrait —and by the way—when she died. She never finished the portrait, and she made it to the show. What were my responses to that portrait? I cried. What had to bet? Lucinda came away. I’m not a lot in general. And I’m sure I’d like to know that – partly all the excitement of placing in the box, and partly the unexpected moments in my dad’s voice , and partly the fact that I was wearing her clothes, and partly the realization that this was my aversion to her contest ... but I didn’t get so much encouragement as I was singing . Like that old favorite song in an empty grocery store, I felt sad, too. I had my eyes open and the tears over and over and I had to keep wiping them away. You wouldn’t think you could do so many things at once, too. Dancing, singing, and getting there... I’ve just looked here as far as possible. But maybe that song really struck me as a talisman for joy, because just as the song was ending, I spotted a wine with a celebratory polka-dotted label on sale for six dollars a bottle. By the time I made it to the register with my arms . I had a drink of that wine, I was feeling like I had the right idea. Of course
