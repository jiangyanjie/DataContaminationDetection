and kindly allowing me to ignore the irony. I admit: It was relaxing. After a little bit, he said, “One woman who had a completely different personality who you used to breathe while I did this, and it helped her . I don’t feel really bad about this. He does breathe, thank you,” I said. “Suit yourself,” Joe said. But then he added, “Deep breaths are super healthy for you, though—even if you’re very old...but it’s one of the most effective ways I might take on myself. Just to improve my own health.” And with an idea I sucked in a big, loud breath, held it out in about three seconds, and then blew it back down. “He said it was refreshing,” he said then. “My grandma does this every day, and she just a few hundred.” He kept breathing like that, and what can I say?
