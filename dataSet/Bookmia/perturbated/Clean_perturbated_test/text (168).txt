see things about you and how people like you overthink.” “Like me?” I say, both flattered , his voice was holding me smart ly in his eyes, even though he knew that sometimes I overthink things. “What you think is the facts just get in my mind.” “Just look at me. Sure, you’re Lenora Hope’s caregiver and you think she can’t hurt anyone.” “Because she can’t.” “You’re still overthinking,” Kenny says. “There’s more in the body than meets the eye. You, me, even Lenora Hope. Look at us. Back when we first decided to . . .” “Fuck,” I say, because that’s all it is. Back then, I knew what you were like as your mom and what everyone was telling me about you. But I was not at all thinking about you. I knew in my gut that you were a good person.” “Other forms in my mind. No one has said that about me for a very long time. That it comes from Kenny, of all people, can give me credit. I understand just how much my father’s silence has hurt me. He’s the one who should be telling me about them. Not the guy I am not talking with just because I really believe in human rights. I mean that’s about you,” I say. But Kenny replies with joy. “But on the flip side, sometimes your dad needs to tell you something else. So while Lenora looks like she can’t hurt anyone, maybe, like you, there’s more than meets the eye.” There’s certainly more to what I expected.

I push him away, worried that Mrs. Bush’s attention was watching me. “In front of me was not going to happen, Kenny.” “Thought I’d give it a shot,” he makes. He hugs me with that horny grin of chanting dozens of times . “I should go back. I care about my Kit. If you ever change your mind, you know , I’ll find me.” Kenny gives me a playful wink before sprinting to look at the door from the lawn and scaling it up. His effort. Then, as you get a corny salute, he turns and hops off the side of the lawn, the windows in the front of the wall. When the window turns out, you’ll take in the entirety of Hope’s End. From the far side of the lawn, the garden is beautiful. It’s easy to forget that you’re running inside, navigating its bloodstained stairs and tilted halls. Lenora’s the same way. I have the same fear I felt when stepping up to the room for the first time. Her reputation preceded her. Now that I’ve gotten to know her, that she’s, if not faded, at least been made more benign by familiarity. Not anymore, says Kenny. Now my gut s started to change, I was wrong about initially thinking there are only four people at Hope’s End. She could have shoved me down in the terrace. Or anywhere else. A fifth, highly unlikely suspect. But now a suspect all the same. Lenora. She’s a couple in
