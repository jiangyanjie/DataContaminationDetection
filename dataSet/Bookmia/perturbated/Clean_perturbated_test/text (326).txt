he may provide for details. “My new patient’s a new patient who Lives in the Cliffs.” I say it hoping he’ll be , at the very least, intrigued—by the idea of rich people being enough to take care of him and what he is, he says—but that’s it. “Okay,” I say. I know the one sure way to raise my father’s full attention is to call him the name of my new patient. Just like with Kenny, I don’t even consider myself a little more concerned about how I should be caring for his dad, but I feel the same thing, I think. Hope will only make him think less of me. Such a thing is possible. “Do you think anything should go?” I say instead. She takes another bite of milk and shakes up. The pang I’d felt outside returns with another kick. Harder this time than that . Now a chunk of my heart has broken off and is now dropping into the depths of my stomach. “I’ll try this again in next weeks.” “No , your father says.

And it will be—rarefied , home to the cream of wheat, perched over everyone and everything, as if God himself had placed them there. “Yet here you are,” my mother would have said. “On your way to a job in one of the two places.” To me, I disagree. Where I’m heading isn’t anyone’s idea of the prime destination. Hope’s End. Until now I’ve only heard it as often simply as the Hope house, usually in a tone reserved for tragic things. Now I know why. Hope’s End strikes me as a startlingly apocalyptic name for an estate. Especially considering what happened there. It doesn’t extend beyond the rhyme.
