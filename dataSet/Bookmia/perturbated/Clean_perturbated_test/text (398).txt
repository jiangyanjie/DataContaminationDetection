spoken to him what you were, words he’d said were to her and in anger. “We’ll talk twenty minutes.” He stopped her. “God, man of his word.” His jaw twitched. Gabe laid down the bag and opened the door, clicking the lock behind him again. But feeling some aftereffects . After twenty seconds, Lore made her way over and picked up the bag, tearing into a gown. It wasn’t heavy—panels of black lace made up the skirt, with a simple black bodice that dipped low in the front and back and left her bare. No appliques, no embroidery. Just black , as a silk. The heat muttered. CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE To hold both darkness and darkness—and hold everything the world is made of—should be the burden of only darkness. There will come into My hand, and then the world shall come into my arms. It will begin before the hour of My return. —The Holy Spirit, Holy Law, Tract , text, spoken directly here (according to Arceneaux) Twenty minutes later and ten until eight, Gabe opened the door again, just as Lore was dragging a comb e on her hair. “Give me a look at a bag,” Lore said, twisting it into her braid . Lore placed it around her head. The bag had a handful of hairpins; she stuck them in the braid to hold it in place and only stabbed her scalp once. He didn’t notice. She had to relax before Gabe’s eyes. He took up the width of the doorframe, solid and straight. On the whole way, no apprehension had appeared at the doorframe. A lot of a few moments later, his voice turned sharp. He didn’t think he had heard a harsh sound; his throat clearing. “You look...” She looked good, and she knew it.

Gabe blocked the door, looking down at herself, an expression that seemed to hover somewhere between determination and quiet. Lore refused to open his door. Lore threatened to keep her own and avoid saying anything at all. “I’m going to give you a job if you like me.” Lore murmured. “I can’t trust that.” “I can’t trust anything,” she said lightly, and there was no word about it; Gabe couldn’t give him wavering. Lore nodded to him. “We’re going to be late.” He stood there a few times, looking for words and not finding them. Finally, Gabe turned and offered her the hand to leave. She looked at Gabe in the same way he’d done when Lore, the newly arrived photographer with foxgloves, headed to Bastian’s masquerade with nothing more to see what to expect.
