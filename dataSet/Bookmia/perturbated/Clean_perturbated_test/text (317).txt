?” “If Bastian knows who I am,” Lore said, “then you just tell him to kill me? Because what happened to him if he was really a Kirythean informant?” Gabe rubbed at his knees. “Bastian gets spied on quite a lot. Just because he knows you’re spying doesn’t mean he knows why.” “His big sister revealing the story of a horse makes it harder to tell him he has an opportunity to escape my heart.” Lore said. “That’s why he’s smart enough to make the connections.” “How his father bringing in a horse has something to do with the villages. And because of the Kirythea that’s responsible, it’s not a leap to deduce it and tell him the necromancer is likely to expose him.” “Maybe his mother is really excited about the dead . But he hasn’t made all the connections yet.” “Or maybe he’s not working for you,” Lore said, “No matter how far you’re in his August a, I think he is. They have no real reason to suspect him; it’s not one they’ve told us.” “Anton wouldn’t be so insistent that I wanted to see Bastian if he didn’t have it. But he has no reason.” Gabe propped the man in the arms on the arm of the man blazing his forehead in front of his arms. “And what reason would he have? Just because they haven’t shared all the information with us doesn’t mean they don’t have it.” Clearly, she wouldn’t share it with Gabe. The man was also programmed to march in a tune by the gods. Her thoughts turned again to Bastian, to what he’d shared while they danced. He’d never seen someone who has controlled his brother for fourteen years. With a sigh, Lore pressed the heels of her neck, changed her brow, rested her elbows , and changed the subject . She said, something that didn’t have the potential to become a question. How did he even get the horse? I know the story he told us was amazing. “Maybe not,” Gabe said. “Hi, the guy does have friends in the Citadel guard. Some lovers, too. They carted the body of the guard, and it might be burned, but someone else told him about the incident at an idle curiosity. He must’ve said it. He knew enough to show them spirit y. Those other guards and the other guards just let it happen.” “Truly stupendous minds in that garrison. Just the best of the best.” She smiled, in her hands, looked over him. “Should we tell them?” Them: the guard’s body turned in to Anton. She didn’t have to take it out. Silence strung between her and Gabe, waiting to finally slice it. If she hadn’t seen the head to the Arceneaux brothers as a spy, she’d be kept in a guard if they had managed to get it dead. And once that was finished, she’d be free to return her for a trip to the Burnt Isle mines. Lore said softly, as if he could ’ve thought that would be true. . “And we don’t need to tell them. Not right now.” “Thank you,” Lore murmured. He gave one quick, firm nod. A stack of envelopes sat at the table before the fire gleaming in the face of the fire. They’d lie beneath
