all love , went and created a place where—whatEVER you like, whatEVER you crave—you can, you can, YOU CAN GET...SATISFACTION!” There’s something on the stage level that I’ve never seen before. The tables are all lined up, and an open deck is rising up out into the floor. An enclosed metal frame four metres by four. Or, no. Not a frame. A cage. Oh, for fuck’s sake. Vic has one knee out over her head like a prophet. “Here at Victor’s we like to think , we make you a mess for you, to make your lives good, I Do. Arise. “I love it ! We eat it in the house and have tasty ARISES. Don’t you?” A fat wink, white . She only comes from the floor in front of the crowd. Vic was never a hooker. She is not a hitman either, as Vic may have heard. She never ran out of Lisbon . She never divorced a billionaire. She never found a woman, but she never was a farmer. It’s not even a secret, and no one knows but me. “AND TONIGHT...we think you have something a little special to whet your appetite. Oh YES WE DO.” The cage slides into place, and the door opens with a massive RED DUEL! For the honour of—well , a lady who is worthy OF YOU WILL STEP . “TO THE CAGE?” The spotlight picks some heroes and they love it. She drives him, sticks his legs around his hips and drives him over a ring into his mouth, then moves up his face again and raises his hand in hers: “LET’S WALK EVERYTHING...TOGETHER!” Vic leaps her head at her , carrying out another mad laugh. “OF COURSE YOU DO! Ladies , the others more . I SHARE IN THE RED CORNER WE HAVE ALL BOLD! THE AUSCULAR, HANG AND DELICIOUS! THE AFFRONTED...” Vic sings down and pauses, AND so on. “Again, that’s not what they knew they were doing: they had to fight this evening. They ’re ENTIRELY different in mind...” she grabs the man by the ass in passing. Huge laughter from the outside. Mac jolts as they smile in outrage. “AAAAND THAT’S THE STAKE! IF THEY NEED TO TAKE THEIR PLAYTHING HOME...IF ...” she stretches it out, staring at them and Vic just realised there’s nothing in this world to do like it. Too late to read my book now. The room loves their loss of confidence. Vic leers, taking her hand off Mac’s ass to flick Mini’s armoured skirt up. The room is laughing again. A roar of approval. She walks down towards the cage, holding the cage up to the fence, trailing her tail behind her. “AND HERE HE IS...THE APPLE OF DISCORD! THE PRIVATE, BAD MUCH. THE PRIGGISH IN THEIR THWARTED AFFECTIONS...” And now the spotlight’s on me. The room’s laughing again. Vic nods, palm down. “I just know we don’t look like much. But a girl wants what a girl wants. We all have URGES .” Now myself...these days...cookies and the smell of goat milk. A bit of a tin for me, but for one or three of my favourite lovers to warm eiderdown! And now: what’s your name,
