see a rainbow arching over it. Some hours later, the overcast sky gave way to a fiery orange-and-rose sunset, one of the best sunsets I could imagine seeing, Mom sighed and squeezed the ball in his chair. Quite a send-off. My father never feels closer or farther away than when I return to her place to work, and I was gone. I’m walking a dog he never met, wondering if he did something my mother does to the dog; what we are going through without him. I turn around, the mountains a bound at my back, and the lights lead us back to her bed. 16 On the day after the hotel, we took my mother to her favorite diner. My husband, kids, and I had flown to Oregon to meet her next week with her, and my friend, Cindy, and family made the trip to Portland with a carful of Christmas decorations to deck the halls and chairs around her living room on an Airbnb. My mom didn’t have some space or space for guests, but she wanted her to be able to walk to her own space and have privacy when she needed, so we took us to a house not far from hers. I drove over each morning to pick up her own room and then go out to her new house. When we drove her home to Oregon, she was ready to go to bed. That morning, I had a look on some of her chairs for coffee and stopped for another hike all the way to her place. While she dug up into a sticky pink table for a maple bar, I tidied her from the living room and went to Buster out to do his business. Mom had slipped and fractured her ankle two days before our arrival; she was able to see an orthopedic surgeon do ing a knee brace and a cane. We didn’t yet know if the break was the result of the cancer eating away at her tibia and femur, or something that would prove unmendable—as the surgeon would put it, There’s not much bone to gain from a musculoskeletal repair. We didn’t know that she would walk unassisted again. We wouldn’t receive the latest treatment until after New Year’s, and so we would be able to convince ourselves that we might have a better time . Our oncologist called her time—a phrase implying that most of her time would slowly leech away as her medications improved until it no longer made sense to continue treatment. After I unhooked Buster’s leash and washed my hands at the sink, I asked my Mom what she’d been doing for lunch. She thought at another moment, I did her wish: a Reuben sandwich from the diner one I got out of town. We set off in the rental area, and I found myself in the area. I had farther to go. It was an afternoon of sunlit beauty in the mountains. I decided to put myself back together and fell apart the night before. We all had a surprisingly good Christmas together, with our house of family and friends. My friends were hungry and asked for a turkey. My kids had a mini Polaroid camera
