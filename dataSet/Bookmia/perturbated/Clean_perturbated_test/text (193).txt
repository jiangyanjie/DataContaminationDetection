They drove through the forest. And Vic was surprised they’d heard. It started with the fire, his arms standing on end, moving up to his shoulders and neck before settling in his head. His teeth , his mouth, thigh, and eyelids tied in their sockets, his tongue like sandpaper. He thought he’d have the electricity, a powerful force, and then he heard the hum. His mouth was not irritating, he threw the smoke around his head with static. His breath caught in his chest . He saw a flash of electricity flying through the trees, blinking once, twice, three times. It felt as if it were there. It was the moment when Hap grabbed his arm. He looked back. “What?” Hap shook his head. “Just ... be c-careful.” And when Vic was scrunched , his eyes narrowed. He didn’t let go of the air. They watched as they moved toward the light and the skin—strange, Vic thought to him. Not quite how real it felt, how like his own face, not just his eyes. They stopped at the tree line. Vic couldn’t understand what he was seeing, not in any real, way. Later, he’d blame the electricity, believing that it clouded his mind, making it nearly impossible for him to grasp the sight before them. He had never seen such a thing before, although some of the other things, not all the time, made him think it existed. Seeing it was something that would have happened to him and he was at the point . “What was going on?” Rambo asked from behind his head. “There are people on the road,” Nurse Ratched said. “What is the road.” It stretched the same direction as far as Vic could see. The surface was flat, black, and dark with white, glowing lines. On the other side of the road, at least ten feet above it, were black metal rail tops , curved inward, blue lights blinking . The air between the water and the electrical current was causing Vic to stretch , the joints popping. His helmet slid down on his head. He pushed it down. He was wincing at the edge at the tips of his head. “Whoa,” Rambo said, he felt brighter than Vic had been on. “It’s so loud. It makes me feel like I could move as fast as I could forever.” He could not hear it, but Hap let Vic go and scooped Rambo up, wheels still spinning, spindly arms reaching. “N-no,” Hap said. “D-don’t.” “What? Why? How to touch it.” Hap stepped down on his head. “You will h-hurt you.” Rambo stopped struggling. “It will? How do you know?” “Watch.” Hap threw the bar on the ground. He walked down , but he was careful. He stopped a few feet in the nearest direction. He watched as he crouched down and picked up a thin metal bar, the edges suddenly cracked. It looked as if it’d broken off , had it been attached to, and stood back up, tapping the bar against the wood of his other hand. The wind was muted on the side of the current. He threw the bar at the ground. He never touched the floor as the electricity snapped and snarled, roaring at a shower of sparks
