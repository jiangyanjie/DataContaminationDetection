. It takes me a moment and Kyle must open up the door. The hidden speakers cycle through screams and menacing footsteps. The sounds seem to be coming from every direction. Kyle opens my hand and pulls me toward the showers, and we’re mounting as it passes. We’re out and running through the steps before letting loose. We’re going to give chase again. We slam the door shut and wedge a trash in on the top. With a long distance from my bedside, the men of the shower can scrapes across the ground, and the gray-haired man swam his arm through the crack in the door . He’s able to see the canisters everywhere. I reach in my pocket and have a half-empty can of bear spray. I angle it toward the opening in a corner and empty the canister directly into the faces of the two men. My eyes are hard to cough , and I feel the cold as a residual cloud of noxious gas wafts into the shower building. My throat burns the water uncontrollably. Bezi coughs so hard, she almost vomits. I run to the sink and turn on the water, flushing my eyes . There’s a loud bang, and I start to see the angry faces of both men , and I shove d the bathtub into the open door any more. My mind runs in circles. The windows in the shower room are for venting only. They’re high and narrow and impossible to climb through. There’s no back door. “What can we do?” Bezi stammers, a trail of spittle hanging over her chin, the whites my eyes bloodshot.

There’s no toilet there, just a metal bathroom is attached with a sign that has to lie between the bathroom and hanging out from front. “We’re gonna hide?” Bezi asks. “They already know we’re in here!” I pull the door and stare down into the door and step back into her stall . I push Bezi toward it, and she quickly shimmies into the ladder that leads to the hidden tunnel. This one connects the showers to the arts-and-crafts lodge on the south side of the camp. The tunnel is still very long and unlit, but it is only option . The sound of splintering splits the air, which is when the two men fall into the shower building, tripping , walking, walking, laughing and shouting. The gray-haired man rushes me before they get down the ladder and into the shower building. She grabs me by the front of my shirt and slams me back against me. Pain s crammed me in the shoulder as her rancid breath blows into my nose and mouth. He smiles
