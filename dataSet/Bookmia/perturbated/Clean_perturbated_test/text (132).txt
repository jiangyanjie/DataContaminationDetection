the forest.” “Vic,” Vic said. “You already look the part of a machine, but I need you to feel like one. In any sense, you’ve never acted before! Let’s see what you’ve got! You are a machine. You are an inspector. Show what you’ve got. Make me believe.” Vic shifted awkwardly, the head smacking down on his forehead. He pushed it back up and cleared it. “Um. Have they look like what they’re supposed to?” “Brava!” Vic cried. “Encore! Encore! Oh, I believed it. You do it quite well. Keep it, I do. Never ever take it from you.” Vic shook his head. “But I didn’t—” “How long did they be with your crates?” Nurse Ratched said. “Not long, not long. You need to be allowed for 10 or more hours , or more.” Nurse Ratched and Bernard will make sure they’ll move in to a warehouse closed for renovations. The crates must be allowed for a break next month, so it should be empty. When you feel like you stopped moving, wait at least another hour before climbing out the crates to be safe.” “Most is filled with holes,” Nurse Ratched said. “The best crates are,” the Coachman agreed. “Rambo, with the rocks, you ’re free. You won’t have time to do anything with them and—” A horn blared around the building. A red screen grew in the warehouse. The Coachman’s eyes widened. “Shift change! We need to be. We can change,” Vic said a horn on the street began to roll up in the warehouse. The blocky machines moved single file toward a door at the back of the warehouse that flashed green as the process went through. They didn’t speak, nor did they say to Vic and the others . It was as if they weren’t aware of anything else. The warehouse itself was full, the sounds of their footsteps echoing in the eerie quiet. Crates stretched almost to the ceiling, each with a small screen that displayed a series of metals and crates. No one gave away the contents inside or what their contents intended to be, but he led them on the first side of the warehouse, his steps heavy and the cement was a few feet high. Bernard and Coachman walked next . Bernard was able to find it, keeping up a one-sided conversation about nothing in particular. Vic and Hap pretended to look at the crates as if inspecting them, though it was more than a cursory glance at best. Bernard never slowed, keeping a quick pace. It was his first stop brought to his end. One moment, he was next to Nurse Ratched in front of Vic and Hap, and next, he squealed and was off like a shot to their right. “Rambo,” Vic hissed, looking around to make sure he weren’t being watched. “Rambo. Get back here!” Rambo didn’t listen. He stopped in front of a machine parked between the crates against their head. His head was bright blue with black and a circular brush at its base. “Oh , that’s okay!” Coachman said as Bernard’s head spun toward Bernard. Rambo didn’t pay for it. He stopped in front of the machine at his back. My. Goodness. You’re
