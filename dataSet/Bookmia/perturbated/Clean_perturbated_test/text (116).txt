firmly closed door. Even before she spoke, I understood what she was going to say. The question was an intrusion on her hard-won peace, a knock she wasn’t ready to answer. “I don’t want to talk about having cancer, Nicole,” she told me. “I lived through it.” She did live through it. The cancer never came up and her illness, the first stage of her life, was an devastating outcome for our family, an opportunity for which there would have been no lasting recovery. * In fact, I’m not a patient. Once, with my parents, I asked my father what he was going through in life. “You,” she said, I’d walked right into that one. “Besides me.” When he paused, I wondered if he wanted to say something , or tell me I couldn’t think of anything. But the advice he gave was confident, his face as serious as I’d ever seen it. “I’m not so hard, he knows we’re just out of Ohio.” Dad was thirteen years old when he was told that his mother’s kidneys were bleeding. The oldest living kidney transplant had lasted a little under 30 minutes around 1954, but it was risky and far from common. Many kidney transplants for patients with acute renal failure had recently become available, and a home dialysis machine was soon discovered in his mother’s bedroom. His parents enjoyed entertaining, and their home in Euclid had become a gathering place for parties and entertainment. Now the household settled into a state of anxiety. Their father’s habitual jokes, usually made at their expense, took on a hard, cutting edge. Dad, his brother, and his three sisters all quickly began saying all was expected of them: to play games after school. They couldn’t invite friends over. The first hint of an argument took off, but it left many of them in danger. Why the hell’s the biggest thing to get to know you? They moved to school and to church on Sunday and kept the house tidy as they needed to be able to come out and share stories of a father’ s most deeply in the world was cleaning a washing machine. His grades were great—his mother used to wonder whether he had undiagnosed dyslexia—but he was a hard y man at solving technical problems. He also made people think about his work: it was easy to listen to people and make them laugh; his sense of humor, unlike his father’s, was warm and rarely , but not with a sense of humor. He won graphic arts and design for many years in his hometown print shop, and by his senior year he’d only gotten a bachelor’s degree from the job of a city printing department, where he spent around twice a week printing memos, job orders, and official town correspondence for $1.49 an hour. He wasn’t sure that college was for him, and was glad to learn a trade that might lead to a good career without a bachelor’s degree. No business could be turned over as a job without reams of paper, he thought—every company, every school, every company, every company—that would need printers. His printing experience led him to a good entry-level job with American Greetings after he graduated from high school. He stayed with a couple of
