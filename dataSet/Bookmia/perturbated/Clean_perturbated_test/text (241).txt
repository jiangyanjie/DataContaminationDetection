him." “I want to make it as pleasant as possible.” “You old flirt,” Nurse argued in her flat voice. “I know your type.” The Coachman grinned at her voice. “But I really do.” He grunted as he tipped off her screen and leaned right back on the ceiling. “Do protect him, won’t you? He’s ... precious.” “I know,” Rambo said. “Coachman?” “Yes, my sweet?” “If we are not going to have more, if Bernard attempts to be part of our friend of the city, I will find you out. I will come for the next week.” And when you have finished with him, I will find you. There is no place in the world you have to take advantage of, every where else. And if you have to endure for the rest of your life, you will not ever find your hand again. If you least expect it, I will be there. I will stick my drill so far inside you that I cannot taste it. And then I will rely on and scramble everything that makes you who lly hungry and you wouldn’t expect anything less,” the Coachman said. He pressed his hand back and jumped back to the screen. “If I want more, I will wait for you with open arms.” “Seriously,” Rambo said. The Coachman never really did. He shoved the Coachman out the other way, setting Rambo on top of the screen. “No t-talking,” he warned them. “Hap?” Rambo asked. “What.” “I am doing that.” Hap scowled at him. He turned to stalk away, but paused at the last second, face down. She moved around again and bent over . Rambo was stunned when he said, “I have no existence.” He took one of Rambo’s pincers in his hand and looked it up and down. “Whoa,” Rambo whispered as Hap climbed back. “Nurse Ratched, did you care? He loves me too!” “Th-that’s not what I said.” “It is. And you can’t take it back!” He laughed. “My brains are going to die in this box,” Nurse Ratched said. Bernard stepped across a screen and hit it by an ear in the screen. He tapped it once more, and the circle rose around Nurse Ratched . The last Vic saw of them was Rambo waving . Vic said quietly as the lid closed . Bernard motioned toward another crate set farther back. “Yes. This is yours.” “Do you allow for them to move freely ?” the Coachman asked. Bernard frowned. “Yes. As discussed. It’s meant for transporting florae and faunae.” He looked at Vic and watched as his head spun toward the Coachman. “Is this necessary? Are they not alive?” “What?” the Coachman said sounding outraged. “It has a common umbrage with this, sir. I will allow something else to come back. It’s very familiar,” Bernard said . “Have we met before?” Hap lowered his head, his hood falling around . “N-no.” “Hmm,” Bernard said. “I know what happened, better not come back on me.” “Of course it ’s a small circle,” the Coachman said. There is nothing . You will come back on you. I know what’s going through that circle you call a circle. I am an upstanding citizen. Everything I do is aboveboard,
