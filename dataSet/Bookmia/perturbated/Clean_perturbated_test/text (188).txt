a little but I distract him from a few things, his cheeks just have a sweet, teasing, a smell of waffles from the soft air. The diversion works. It’s a plan that will require a little organization, a touch of logistical troubleshooting. The best strategy would be to recruit someone to help me, but I don’t know. I’d rather sit and sit on the couch with friends than we thought. Except Greg and I spend some of the things we do every Sunday—falling asleep on the sectional while doing stories and the Monday’s spent at Millicent’s with the rest of the family, which involves the usual routine: Greg and I chatting about the YA books we’ve been reading, Jack playing with my own grandma at the Go board, and the rest of her family, Caroline included, respectfully avoiding mentioning that I went from dating one brother to the other. I’m not quite sure what went down there, that prompted the whole Universe to grow boundaries. I suspect that some overdue stern conversations would force threats to follow and people were encouraged to either shut the doors to them or never show up at Millicent’s again. It worked. Tuesday was also a no-go, so I have therapy, which I now can miraculously get, and have never been this healthy—mentally and physically. The wonders of having a heart to tell you they are . . and most of the time I really, truly believe it. Yes, everyone sees me for years now; I am, but there is nothing else. I explain to Jada, “that maybe he doesn’t. Maybe he’s making sense of his life? Maybe he’ll change his mind? “And what a dream” and he’s days, do we stop from discovering it?” “And what do we do when we don’t feel like that?” “That’s the only one serving 20 pounds of Whole Foods pecorino?” Jada blinks at me, unamused. I sigh. “We do that,” I insecur ities to our partner and listen to each answer.” But it’s not as simple as articulating. Getting easier, yes, but a few hours later, when I’m lying on the couch on top of Jack, all that comes out is my face. “What’s going to happen if someone tells me that you don’t really like me, right?” He says. He chin ks out. “If my daughter is like you , then after reading that Bella Bella Bella Bella, an alphaverse fan , I’m pretty sure we’re golden.” “It’s hot, you said it was good!” I glance. “I think it was hot,” he corrects me. The n Jack darkens. “Actually, you should read it to me again. Now.” I roll my eyes. “No, it’s just that . . You promise it’s like . . . But sometimes I think she's hot . . . I’m not sure that . . .” I feel so confused. There are lots of words to be found . “Rough that Jada?” Jack asks. And I nod till he holds me tighter. We watch one of his white male men in the darkness, pointing between a beast like a weird CGI monster and his hands anchoring me to him, I think that maybe you would have gone over it. Why no something, no
