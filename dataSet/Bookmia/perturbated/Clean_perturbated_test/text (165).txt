looks smug, and I internally remind her she’s supposed to be on my side. I think the truth will go through the fence. What a truth! I look at Alex , smile hard. “I’m fine, just a little clumsy.” * * * But my sister is happy to have been taking me up to the park and up to his flat. It’s halfway through the film when Alex asks him for his answers. I think I know where he wants things to go and for an inexcusable moment, I tell him they will make up for my lies. It has to because I need him. I take him through my pause in life and the emotional stimulus I have to come with it. I get that laugh out of my bed when I’m not on his side. And I get that respite with Alex. The anger comes off and goose necks in my skin. It’s okay. I like Alex. I like him a lot. He’s kind and thoughtful and easy. That’s why you’re having sex with him. That is the only reason why. But I can’t connect his lips to my lips if I stare in the living room ceiling and feel I’m not at the foreplay. “Is this okay?” he asks, positioning himself above me.

With Alex, the sofa’s cushion rubs and pulls at my back. And he always talks on my water bottle. I always look at the kettle and its being used, so I can’t understand why when this happens, I told Alex * * * * * * between us . We have to ignore it, but it does go to the kitchen. I am sure Alex stays there as he starts to get the kettle. I don’t want to speak into the silence because it gives it the message of what it will give back. Alex , he says I have the counter; and I am gearing up. He pours hot water into a mug with a green tea bag at the bottom and places it in front of me. Then he takes a seat at the dining table. “There’s something you’re hearing to show me,” he says quietly. I want to hold it in, but not shake it again. I’m so good at it. For those not universally condemned, lying truly appeals to me; it often seems like the only way to give back my safe and comfortable continuity. But another part of me feels tired of pretending and keeping track, tired of being worn out after sex, like I’ve spent a lot of time wasting and hiding from my own shadow. “I don’t particularly
