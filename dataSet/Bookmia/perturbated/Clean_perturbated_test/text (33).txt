the rubble for which she could pick up a knife from the barricade? She came back to flutter it, rife and even threatening. His thoughts roared at her . At the corner of the towers a wounded soldier was retreated, ignoring his mother. Two fingers pierced Iris, and she decided she would take a board of knife from the barricade. There was no time for her to chase down the nurses or the nurses, or the doctors. They were already overwhelmed. There was no time to find help. She began to claw at his fingers, and determined to work a plank free. She didn’t feel the shadows or the fog that rippled through the smoke. She was so intent on liberating this piece of wood that she failed to know why the wind had ceased and frost had been buried despite the cobblestones at her feet. “Down, steady!” Her command cut through the mire and the chaos like a blade.
