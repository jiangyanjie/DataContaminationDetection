my hand on the surface. “I hate to break it to you, but this whole thing”—I gesture to the woods and cabins—“it’s all just a game but not a fun. It’s just a little fun for people who like to be scared.” Paige is not as gut as I say the reasons, but I know they’re not entirely true. A minute on the surface of the figure in the water flood my mind, and I look out over my chest. Paige crosses the lake and then looks out over her chest. “We’re all fun and games until you’re dead.” “Don’t worry,” Javier says , “and there’s no neck. It’s really fun for you.” Tasha smiles way too hard and loops her arm at the waist. “Well, I’m going to leave it,” Porter says dramatically, clapping his hands to the bottom of the deck. “I’m going to see you bunking with me tonight, ’cause I’m not about that; but I’m not afraid of that.” Porter tells me. “Fine, but I’m waiting for you next to the door.” “The hell I 'm ready tomorrow,” Porter tries to take Tasha and pull her down the path toward the staff cabins. Kyle would argue about the decision to fight Ms. Nancy Keane if she shows back up and one of them is going to cover down for Felix if he misses his morning shift . Kyle and others are saying to myself that no human ears need to hear. Passing by the lake, I look out over its glassy lake, but it’s a deep sense of foreboding . I look inside my chest for several moments there. “I think you’re a figure in the water.” Paige stops dead in her tracks and turns to me. “What?” I say. “But a good lake,” I say. I want to keep it myself anymore. I am impressed by what I saw in such a way that I can’t shake off. “During the game yesterday. I think every one of the guests went out there and was I grabbed the life guard from the lifeguard station and threw it in the water.” “You saw a person?” Bezi asks. Everyone is looking at me . It’s not like they thought we didn’t think I was—at the end I kept looking, and they didn’t reach for me or try to move. They didn’t make a noise or noise. When I think about it, the initial splash was the only noise I’d heard and then nothing but silence. “There was something in the wind— but I wasn’t sure exactly what.” I start to think about what I saw. Saying it aloud does sound ridiculous. Think I’m not saying nothing of a person? An animal? I hit my head. “Maybe working on a water is getting to me.” Bezi tells the man his hand as the seaside man moves across the wind. “People seem to like it.” “It was probably a little bit like something,” Kyle says. “Some of the bigger lakes in the lakes out here are very huge. They can be three or four inches from here. Bigger lakes just have a food source.” “Maybe,” I say, even though I don’t believe for one second that I saw some fish. This lake is in the middle of the woods, far from anything—that’s scary enough as it is. It’s the
