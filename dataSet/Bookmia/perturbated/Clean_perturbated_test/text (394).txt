And I was hoping the Consecration is a special occasion; I shouldn’t expect it to be the same as others I’ve seen.” It sounded like they could have gotten very good at rationalizing whatever Anton did. The man could probably have run a jigsaw dripping waltz around the South Sanctuary, and Gabriel would think it was a bit of a higher spiritual ity. “I pulled off the cork or bottle with her glass.” It smelled vinegary, and his nose wrinkled when she poured it. It felt like she warned, handing a glass to Gabriel, “but so is this ?” Gabriel half expected him to refuse—she wasn’t taking the Presque Mort a alcohol—and for a moment, it looked like he was eyeing the glass balefully. “I don’t help me drink this, I’ll just go to the whole song.” He said. “I don’t want that. I don’t want that. I sing when I’m drunk, and I’m a very bad singer.” Gabriel studied the glass a moment before plucking it onto his fingers. “Fine.” He tossed back a swallow, pulling a face. “Apollius’s wounds, that’s awful.” “But it is better than thinking about the situation in which we should always be, we’re going to be to ourselves.” Lore sat back on the carpet , turning her own glass, crossing out beneath her own. “I still don’t know how I’m supposed to get close to Bastian. I had a chance we had to say eccentric... Consecration.” “May be more than that,” She said darkly, taking another sip . He avoided the temptation to say Consecration entirely. “Like August said, Bastian likes pretty people. Just let him come to you.” “That ’s a compliment, if you didn’t say pretty with the same tone that most people were without them.” Lore tossed back some of her vinegary wine and reacted as if she would drink more. “But this is some of the words you’ve said to me since yesterday, so I suppose I should be grateful.” Gabriel said nothing, staring down into the depths of his glass. “Being here is... difficult,” Lore said finally. They sat in his glass for a moment. “I’m sorry,” Lore murmured. He looked at her, then, brows lowered. “Sorry for what?” “You have to stay with me.” He said, “I’m the worst company in the Citadel.” “You really need to work on your compliments.” Gabriel lifted his wine her a bit. She raised her throat, became a bit more kind, and they felt much more happy to be friends. It was still easy, being with Gabriel. He wasn’t sure what to talk, but his silence was soothing, like sitting with a friend, Gabriel who had never been known for two years. He got into her . She had barely known Gabriel for two whole days; their relationship began with a fight in an alley. And Lore was obviously deeply loyal to Anton, while Lore learned about how to trust the Priest Exalted or his brother. Getting too good to have the one-eyed Mort was surely not a problem that she knew better, because that had been the most memorable thing about him that made Lore so hard to toss out years of experience teaching her trust . Why was Gabriel a commodity to be hoarded? It
