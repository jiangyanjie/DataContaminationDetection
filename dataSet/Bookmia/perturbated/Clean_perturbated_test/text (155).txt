You’ll then need to seal your books in the brown classified envelopes , where you might find them in your bag, and you’ll hand them to the conductor. Supplies will also come in on the train, so if you need something, let me know. Do you understand what Iris might have told you, Iris?” “Yes Ms. Hammond,” Iris said. But her mouth was dry, her arms still had to sit down, her legs bleeding. Why am she really doing better? Helena said. “Now, get dressed.
