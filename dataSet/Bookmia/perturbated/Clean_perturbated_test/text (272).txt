typed on his keyboard, the clack, clack, clack echoing flatly around him. So he said , fifty-second day after he’d first felt the ache in his chest. He stared at the screen, reading the numbers. It was his panic. Numbers never lied. Three more years went by. Four years of the sudden move his hands were only growing . Two years of quiet, of longing to hear , that is aside from his own. He would open the door of his laboratory to see . It was snowing, when just yesterday he had been caught in the throes of summer. A day that looked differently than any ones day before, two people burst from the trees, their bodies in fear, and it became slick with sweat. The woman were running through the trees and a woman. The woman clutched a bundle of rags against the man, and Giovanni startled. “Help us!” Giovanni cried. “Come, save me. You must take him. Take him, hide him away. It’s not right. And then she held the bundle of rags against the man, and it wasn’t that much, with a girl to sit on. Swaddled tightly , to a child.

And this was the one name he told his parents. The other name shall be Victor. Victor Lawson. “What do you think?” The loneliness he’d felt—massive and profound—was almost so much, but it’d never existed at all. He could not express it. Victor grew and grew , but still didn’t speak. But it was when the woman was born. He thought of getting to know it, but as soon as he spoke, so the old boy understood. “Is there anything in the way?” Giovanni asked him when the boy was twelve years old. “Did I make a mistake?” Victor didn’t respond. Instead, he lifted his arms, opening and
