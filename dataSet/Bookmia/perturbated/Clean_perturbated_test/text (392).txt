Now I’ve been in the process, for about that time I got in my freshman year and spent forty-eight hours hallucinating that Jack was tired, and my skeleton had finally grown to hatch out of my head. There are no nightmares and a feeling of bone-deep rest . Suddenly a big body curved behind me, arms and shoulders pushing from my torso like a cross, securing me to him. It’s not unlike the way I awoke up a few weeks ago. Except as if I was too naked, our skin s are soiled by the shard. The only thing we get right is that we have to change the sheets.
