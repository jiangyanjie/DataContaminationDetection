The house was still so extraordinarily big, so white—like a wedding cake, many tiers high. The park was desert, all baked earth and scrub grass. Dust came out from the forest, from the sky. It was desolate, a dreadful place. I’m not equal to this, she thought. “Yes, here,” she said to the narrator. He was angry when he got out and her very own self vanished. She reconnected with her fingers, ruffles, and became the Duchess of Montagu. * * The occupant ushered Hephzibah through the hall. Servants paused in their duties , who looked behind them. The space was still dark. She’d forgotten all those blocks of black and blood-red marble. Even buried in stains like gravestones, signposts on windows and on trees. It was not something more likely to return to hell. How many times had she cleaned the banisters, left them with blacking, with nails on their grooves and whorls? The footman gave Hephzibah a wide and courteous berth. “No more visitors,” he told the under-footmen, and pointed down the doors. He was enormously good-looking. Stony , haired, terrific . There was something to move on, to occupy the mind. “This way,” he told her, a gloved finger. “Oh, I will guess the answer,” said Hephzibah. She needed to warm up, to test the voice. “People will be coming in one direction , but I still want to build a house like this.” She reacted with her parasol, and took off his tongue.

There had been two chairs upstairs. It made her dizzy, the memory of all those tiny pieces of wood. It took hours and hours to polish every block. The saloon doors slid open—slowly, slowly. She spied a little bit of coffee, then dubbed it on a couch, just in the center of her room. Great , the most beautiful piece of light came by her windows facing the park. Hephzibah hung her eyes with her hand. She tried to cast her mind back to those days, to remember the mother who’d been in the nursery. A rattling creature, with yellow-gold hair done up in ringlets. More like a pet than a person, the thing fed and watered by her servants. Hephzibah had hardly hoped. This woman, like her, had hardly imagined her living alone or existing at all. This woman—straight, thin, upright, alert—was different altogether. “Don’t let her hook you,” Mrs. de Vries recalled. “Whatever you do.” Hephzibah paused at the desk. She had never imagined her to leave, right now. Claim another appointment, or call the whole thing immediately. Miss de Vries rose to her feet. “Your Grace,” she said,
