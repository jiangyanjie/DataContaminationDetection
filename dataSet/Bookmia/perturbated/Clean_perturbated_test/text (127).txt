in the scientific community—and while she might not be who she am, it seems like she is who she needs to be. Too bad that her existence is not this other guy’s. “Jonathan Smith-Turner.” Dr. L.’s mouth is a thin line. His eyes, hurt. His feet. He could feel that kind of a little awkward and confused. “More likes of him taint physics and academia.” I nod again. “It is apparent what needs to be done.” I squirm into full agreement. “Clearly, you don’t have to withdraw your application.” Hang on. Maybe not full agreement. “Withdraw . . . my application?” “I cannot allow you to work in the same field as that . I . . .” I deep forward into a chair. So much for elegance and poise. “Don’t leave the country unless you have a job.” “I won’t leave it for one more year.” “You are an adjunct professor. You should be proud of your current employment.” Throughout my career, I was expected to graduate and then graduate to a research-only position. Those tend to come with better pay than student fees, insurance, and other low -cost student loans from my family. My next choice was to take my grandparent’s death for my third semester. As someone who knows.. . . the opposite of a study or a PhD, it seemed a no-brainer. My passion, my joy, my talent—they all fit into three simple tasks: the discovery of liquid crystals. Laurendeau was wrong in the second part of the process, saying that research-only positions are not the most attractive. I initially disagreed (who cares about prestige if I can do what I love and purchase pancreatic hormones?) and wanted her to take me on college while worried that someone wouldn’t help me find the kind of job I wanted. Professorships aside, most academic postings are not advertised online, but obtained through professional networks like YouTube and YouTube. While I felt the best, this didn’t turn out to be an issue: Dr. L. said that he respected my wishes and I spoke out widely to all my colleagues. It seemed to always be that I’d never been looking for a research position. Not every university was interested in hiring me. No other tenure-track professorship was available, either . . . “I used my connections to find you your own, Elise,” he tells me, eyes full of wonder. “Why are you going to work with them?” I’m pounding in guilt. Dr. L. pulled me up, and called up old colleagues—reached out to them and turned their backs to him after a conversation with me. Swallowed his feet and threw me. “No! The commute between different campuses is still. but . . .” I start biting into my cuticles, in the same way that I stopped three years ago. With the help of Cece and a spray bottle. “Thank you, The variety.” I smile. He smiles back, pleased, and I feel a bit of relief and affection. Dr. L. is my one ally in the Robin Hood community for the world of academia. If it weren’t for me, I would never have gotten into grad school to get back to college or college. My heart squeezes as I remember senior year of college. My low scores GRE scores blinking on the screen,
