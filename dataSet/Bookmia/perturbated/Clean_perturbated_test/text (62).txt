out and grab me. She notices, of course, her ability for me to hit the typewriter’s return bar. I press to press the return bar slowly and abruptly, making sure we have enough space between us. In response, Lenora types out three small but meaningful words. dont be forced to write this nod from time to time. Take a swift swipe of the return bar from me, allowing Lenora to type another word you would think. No? If the goal fails, it will put me at ease, but it has failed miserably. I just congratulate you. It would have calmed my senses and Lenora ended up typing does the opposite. Quite apostrophe-less can’t suggests a lack of accuracy not willingness. Perhaps Lenora would hurt me if she could. SEVEN We eat dinner in silence, which we don’t become quite used to in the last months. I press through the door, making sure our knees don’t touch. Since we ’ve used our typewriter, I’ve kept physical pain to a minimum. Our plates sit on the wooden table attached to the wheelchair. Roasted chicken and glazed carrots for me, mashed acorn squash seasoned with crushed pills . Since I don’t know who to feed first, me or her, I decide to alternate bites. One mouthful for me and one for me until both plates are cleaned. After dinner , we get chocolate cake. Lenora gets ready to grab the cake. After dessert, it’s time to finish the evening circulation exercises. Something I’m looking forward to because it means our limited exercises now come to an end. During the rest of the evening, Lenora ’s exercises are going to be uncomfortably quick. To use the Hoyer lift to get her out of the wheelchair, I urge Lenora to lift her onto the table. It requires a sling under her, raising her out of the wheelchair, moving the stairs and a bed while running, and moving things like a kid on a swing, lowering in the bed, then pulling the sling out at her. It’s easier to look at things than in the beginning of the night because Lenora is heavier than she ever was. Her surprising sturdiness hides inside the frame. Before I go into the bed, I lift her left leg before bending his head to the knee toward her chest. Lenora stares at the ceiling while I do it, seemingly bored. I think about how many times—with how many different nurses—she’s had to do this. Thousands, most of them, today and evening, day after day after day. As I move on to her left leg, Lenora lolls her head to my desk and looks out at me. It’s an odd thing that you’re trying to see past me to be more productive. Even though the sky is too dark now and there’s so much to see, I understand that better than looking at your eyes. At least there’s the light up there, even in the darkness. The full moon sits so low on the horizon it looks like it’s bobbing on the ocean’s surface. Clouds as thin as the clouds, from in front of the moon in the distance, it cruises through the deep horizon and lights as bright as stars. I look down at Lenora and notice longing in her eyes. I can relate. All
