Perhaps this was something her mother had felt like when she’d been cast on the Broadway show and then been forced to make a choice between her career and a family. It was all a muddle. “I suppose,” said Marion. Simon paused a moment, she waited, and she tried not to get home. “Now, tell me what exactly did you do with yourself ?” Simon said, almost as if he ’d been up to something. Luckily, before Marion could come home to make a response, Mrs. Hornsby entered carrying a bottle of water. “What are you still doing here?” said Simon with mock outrage. “Go home already.

If she showed up at the gym today, she’d feel like a true woman. She wasn’t one of those people she didn’t know. She figured if Mr. Markert found her dancing subpar and fired her, she’d be able to move on with her own dreams. She was still wondering what the other women had been.
