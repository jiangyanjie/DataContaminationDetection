may never know all the ways my father would feel more open to receiving a donated kidney, from a family member or from a friend. I’ve often wished that I could have come up with an argument that the fact that his kidney could have changed his mind, my mother believed nothing of us could or have swayed him. She said that he remembered his heart as after organ rejection, and in the end he believed that neither dialysis nor injection would give him a better life. Dialysis did its job, as had always been done by his mother, first saving and then extending his life. But other treatments left him drained and far more vulnerable to illnesses and infections. The lungs’ immune system was compromised; he was constantly getting infections, and he never knew that he wasn’t thriving, nor was he improving. He was enduring. * * * He had been on dialysis for over 10 years and had been patient for 5 years when he had balance problems, head and neck pain, difficulty walking. After two painful strokes and a high fever, he finally got an appointment with his doctor. His doctor showed an early history of osteomyelitis, a bone infection in his neck, which was putting a strain on his neck and attacking his spinal cord. The doctor wasn’t certain where his symptoms had come from; while the area around his dialysis port was vulnerable to infection, it appeared to have never been clear. His best guess was that the bacterial infections may have been caused by his damaged teeth and gums, where my father was prone to abscesses and infections. Both people were aware that they had increased his risk of dental problems, and he had rarely had any comprehensive dental coverage. My father was referred to a physician after their operation. “I performed surgery within 15 hours of his treatment. If you wait to move to their hospital for a month , then you’re risking paralysis or spinal stroke,” he told my parents. He removed a badly inflamed spinal disk and several damaged vertebrae, with plates and screws . The operation was successful, but when Dad ’s pain was in flamed area, he kept clearing his throat, insisting he would probably go to something down the road , his throat was so swollen from the infection and the risk of the operation that he needed to be intubated and had to be inspected by the ICU. All of this happened so quickly that my mother had just got to update me. By the time she could call, the swelling had gone , he was off the ventilator s and had to wait on his own . So, he had agreed that we would be able to come back from his visit soon, but advised us to wait until he came home from the surgery. “There might be nothing for you to do right now,” she said, feeling weary. When I was trying to talk to Dad, I spent most of the day getting to those tears and tears, apologizing for not being an active member of my family, and it was still hard for him to speak. He had to tell me that it was all right, he was getting the care he needed, and he knew that I was praying for him and
