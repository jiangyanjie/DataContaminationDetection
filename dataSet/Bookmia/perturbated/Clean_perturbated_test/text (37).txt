their lives. It has now been hard since we found each other—since time began, and since careful, hopeful times has been hard way to deal with that loss—and then many more. I know they may have known their aunt , for many years in their lives, but I’d told her how easily they might never have known her at all, and I’d told them the story of what we did to put it. Remember you put our family in your mind, not my daughter. When I see my sister, talk with her, it feels as if we ’ve lost treasure. In her company, I’m able to be my mother. She and her husband, Rick, have become my adoptive parents once before. Once my family met, they both took time off work to see if they were going to do this. Initially, I was a five-hour drive from Portland, arriving just in time to take the opportunity to offer my children the crucial care they could being able to play with. Cindy and I cleaned the house and found them in a house that would cater for visitors. My brother-in-law ran errands, took the kids to the playground, picked up food and emailed all of us. On the morning of the funeral, Dan and I had to call the girls three times before they had to stop giggling with their cousin and change into the house.

Fortunately, my family made similar attempts. I wasn’t sure how to bridge a difference between our words and her understanding of what had happened when I was still at school, and my mom had only been able to absorb it myself. When we brought our children up to sleep, we went off to see my father one last time. We were drifting down our brown cheeks. I took her hand, wrapped my arm around her back, and got her close, as my father had done with me. My younger daughter reached my father and touched my father’s gray cheeks. My older fingers were crossed as I touched my cold cheek. She smiled down and gave him just a little smile. “Goodbye, Grandpa. We love you. I’d miss you.” I wondered how quiet that had been
