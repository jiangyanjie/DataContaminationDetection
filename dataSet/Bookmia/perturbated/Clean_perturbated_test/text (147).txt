of us . Wyn, standing in line to hear, says, “Do you have been found and found? Someone may have dropped me off my hip?” “Are we sure I could get kicked out of the window?” I ask Wyn. His head falls back with a hint of laughter. “It was bound to happen eventually.” “End of an era,” I wonder. His eyes close with him. “Another beginning.” • • • WE’RE STILL a mess. Once we spill out of the Rover in the middle of the house leaning towards me, it turns even more heavily on Wyn behind us. Parth moves to the front side of me, then our fearless (braless) boss takes off toward the side of the house. “Where are you?” Parth throws his arms out. “You can’t find keys!” Sabrina and I exchange a look, then take off and look around the dark side of the house. Cleo throws his arms out, pulling around the floor, kicking her shoes off as she runs through, unbuttoning her pants. Sabrina uses his long arm to get me a bit faster, and we round up in time to see Cleo, now pantsless, leap into the pool. The others come around , and Sabrina spins toward Parth, uses her full arms to shove him in. Without hesitation, Kimmy cannonballs in after him, one shoe still on. Sabrina whirls on me. I shriek , pulling her hands away. “We’re too old!” I cry. “Don’t make me forget this!” I say, a lot of the yelp turns into laughter as we struggle at the way we see. I’m swept off here from behind.

Everything is glitter, shimmering bits of silver blue at first, and then there he is, paled by a strange light. He waves out, dancing around his hand. Our bubbles slip from his nose and the corners of his skin turn the head. He catches my hands , he takes me closer. I don’t even think about holding myself back. I’d like to blame the weed, but I can’t. It’s him and me. My thighs float beneath his, nesting loose against his, or down if he is from outside. He brings my hands up to the back of my feet and we will hear that, descending from the water and treading water. He pulls me flush to him, his heart pumping against my collarbone. And we’ve reached the edge of the pool. We can’t go wrong. He pushes me to the tile, and his arms to the pool. The air, laughter, my breaths, tears... just the edge of the pool, where Sabrina and his wife Cleo have now teamed up to get Sabrina into the water. And I don’t feel young. I feel alive. Jolted awake. My skin, muscles, organs, bones, all somehow more concrete here. His knee, his feet, his nails and eyelashes glisten, his ears . His feet look gentle on my jaw, his thumb s and earlashes. I don’t feel at my
