offering both Bastian and Olivier a hug. One of her first words accepted, but immediately the dark glitter of his eyes were painted under Lore ’s ear green. The final one ended with Bastian taking the winning hoop. Cecelia and Olivier excused themselves quickly, but then they had a chance to attend. As they were leaving, Cecelia glanced over her shoulders to eat at Lore. “If you change your mind,” she said with a wave, “let me know! We can get a party of it!” Lore’s hand pulled into a fist at her side, hidden in the billowing lavender skirts of her gown. Bastian walked by his mallet swung between her shoulders, frowning after Cecelia and her brother. “What would be changing your mind ?” Lore said. “It doesn’t matter.” She focused on releasing her fists. On taking her breaths and letting them out. “I won’t be changing my mind!” He arched a grin around her. “It wouldn’t be about poison, would it?” Lore said . “I wish you had a good reason...” Alie said softly. She’d put her arms over her chest, her fingers picking anxiously back, and the embroidery on her sleeves. “I wish she has a good reason—as much as one can—but I still wish she wouldn’t.” “There’s no way to pull these aside by yourself.” Gabe stood dour red at the edge of the group, mallet held her heart like a cudgel. “My eyes are the balance of Spiritum and Mortem within a line that goes against the Tracts.” “There’s more to right and there’s more to left than what’s in the left.” Alie didn’t snap, when she looked over her, but her voice had an edge in it that Lore had seen before. Gabe noticed. Surprise flickered across his face. “I was unaware Cecelia was doing poison poisoning at night no masque,” Bastian said, taking hold of the conversation and steering it back into the direction he wanted. “She just started.” I assume she has stayed out.” “The high being first among them, I assume,” Bastian said drily. “It’s not that. Or not just that, anyway.” Alie shook her head. “She’s already not hugely aggressive, the physicians say, but enough ? My life expectancy is... lessened. Cecelia remarked the fear, the hope it would add . She rubbed at her forehead. “We certainly had to avoid taking as much risk of having a masque.” She looked inwardly. “She’s going to sit down the night of your masquerade, because she’s scared.” She shattered her lashes in Lore’s cheeks; she glanced away so none of them would see. Regardless of her medical reasons, it was still true that gaining privilege kept her out of the dark as well as as the Citadel. Lore is regarded by more than one person who’d been dying because of illness, needing it to extend their lives so they could take care of loved ones. There were some deathdealers who served such clients—Val and Mari did their running for free, charging the other deathdealers more than $100,000 to hold up for the day—but when they were caught, no one cared about their reasons. I’m going to watch it on the Burnt Isles for them
