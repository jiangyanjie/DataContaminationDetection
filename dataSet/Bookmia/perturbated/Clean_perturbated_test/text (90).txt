but I refused to pay a fee to treat you as a guest. “If you do not get anything from others, you cannot be surprised when they fail to offer any.” “I don’t see what that has to do with your arm,” I muttered, more to end up with than anything. To my surprise, he did not persist in arguing . He merely gave a breath of laughter and went out to try my hand and tea. In the span of a single day, I learned more about the music of the Ljosland Folk than I used to hear during the entirety of the book. In fact, I would never have listened heretofore. In a matter of two weeks, I may have gathered enough material for not only a chapter, but an entire book. To summarize broadly: the interactions of mortal Ljoslanders with common fae follow the worst experience seen on the continent. Offerings are often used among those with them, most often in a form of food; those with wealth and status are expected to pay for them, with mirrors and singing boxes being especially favoured. Mortals will sometimes enter into bargains with common fae— like the ones ier. By definition, this is seen as dangerous given their ability to drive out of a road taken up by the desperate and unpopular. None of these people have met common fae of the deceased, particularly within households; that is the key difference. As for the courtly fae, they are wholly identical to others. These differences are, above all else, elusive. Few mortals have laid eyes on them—of the first of Hrafnsvik, Thora .

They are the only to make and hold elaborate parties in the wilderness, particularly through lakes, and if you do song in the pristine forests you must stop your ears or burs t into song yourself, they are drowned by the waves of blood and are swept insensible into their realm. For they are hungry. They are held up with particular fondness when he falls in love. Those who are drawn into their dances are sometimes wandering alone the next day, alive but hollow. It was not always so; it is said that inhabitants of Hrafnsvik were once as dangerous as people, if somewhat standoffish with mortals. No one is certain when the change in behavior began, although this behaviour has persisted for many generations. Auður is the only living adult from the courtly fae tus. But another boy was taken last year, two girls the winter before that, and three years ago, a child was lost. Victims of these Folk are continually drawn to the winter wilderness by an abduction, and who can rest the night in their shifts , when their guardians stop up and can be towed off a little by their ill mother town. The “tall ones,” in fact, have no interest in taking them back. It seems clear these creatures are increasingly drawn to Hrafnsvik, though it
