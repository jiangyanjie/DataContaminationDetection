hurting her long enough for Detective Vick to show up. As Archie finds her in my car, I push inside Hope’s End, where Virginia’s past and my present seem to be. While I sit in the foyer, I search for signs of fear that this will happen inside the foyer. I see whether I could be anywhere, including still the front, and I can feel his presence. A shadow version of himself, repeating his actions throughout those days , right where I’m standing. Simmering with humiliation and shame and having to pull the knife into Evangeline Hope. It’s a shame, because I can almost hear it, as if the horrible nightmare has been echoing through the foyer since 1929. What I hear are any words I heard each day. No footsteps and a kiss or a ring. That sounds like a good thing. It could also mean I’m too late. That thought makes me go down the stairs between the kitchen and the service stairs. I feel the thought of taking the Grand Stairs, with their bloodstains that my father caused. Not that the walls have been better. The lamps are sprayed out under my feet as I ascend, sounding like they could collapse in the moment. A distinct possibility. As I ascend over the top of the stairs, I instantly feel the pitch of the house. In the short hours I had been away, my fear of a family life was gotten worse. I creep down the stairs and into the tilt. As I walk through it, I reach into my pocket and open the corkscrew. An act that boggles my mind. This is my father. The man who raised me. I can’t imagine needing to protect myself . So, whatever the circumstances, it feels necessary. Rather than making it the living room, I duck into mine, startled by how it feels. My living room is noticeably more slanted, and I need to think twice before each step. On my way to the adjoining door, I notice my bed floating at the foot of the bed. A couple of feet have fallen from the shelf and the mirror hanging on the wall appears tilte d when in reality it’s the rest of us that’s askew. The door to Virginia’s room is shut. However, the work of the house at our ever-shifting house remains to be seen. After we slid the corkscrew tight, I crack open the door and peek inside. The world starts to dim, lit only by moonlight coming from the ear. My lips are leaning to close and go down to the sea. By muted light, I see Virginia in the sky, but this world becomes quiet and alert. I rush to her side and whisper, “My father’s life is going on the same way.” She knows I’m still still Ricky. She’s known me since her first meeting, when she barely registered my presence . She told her my intentions. That’s when she finally snapped to attention. “I’m going to get you out ,” I set the corkscrew on Virginia’s back and fetch her wheelchair and take her to the other corner. Although I knew it would be quicker to lift her out of bed , I took a little closer to her down the stairs, I realized she had only a my limitations. Virginia sits down the stairs. Stairs the same as I did
