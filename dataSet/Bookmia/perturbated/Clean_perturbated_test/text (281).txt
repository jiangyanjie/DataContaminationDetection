the rage that existed deep and bleeding from her gut. It was far too easy to lost her heart, and the rage that forced her mind to turn to bed. Miss Winnie was gathering her skirts, her costume shimmering across, sent her voice down the hall , all the servants would hear her. “Don’t ever forget these things,” she said. * * * Hephzibah didn’t enjoy parties. Never had. They gave her gifts. She knew she’d walked at a ball like this . She held on to the wig with one hand. Her skirts ballooned around her, taking up space, sweeping the robe, and stared. “I know,” she said, raising her hand. “I look marvelous.” They had business to take her. When the ball was underway, she’d begun to see her actresses, sending them circling around the ballroom, knocking over drinks, upsetting supper plates, causing confusion. “Movement,” Winnie had said when they were taking the ball and had travelled to the program for the evening. “We must have constant and lasting conversation.
