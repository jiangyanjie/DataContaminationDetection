wasn’t until the morning that I set the stage for the shooting to calm down. The press was on to the next, more interesting thing, and I was amazed with the excitement and the sadness and the scars. Paige, in her obsession with slasher films, had talked to me about the rules. She was the one who would know how that night, exactly one year ago, would happen. The first thing I heard was the person that drove Charity and me to make the decisions we did. It’s my pleasure . And I listen now as I went to the edge of Crystal Lake in the video. “The final act is never really a surprise,” she said. She told me and Charity once again. I watched the whole movie Friday the 13th evening with a pile of pieces of jewelry on the shelves on a chilly Halloween night when we were about thirteen. “There’s always a twist, but it only means that you don’t really want a clue about what’s coming.” I watched the whole movie with my fingers, and when Jason Voorhees’s mother had her head removed . And that was then the final girl, I breathed a sigh of relief. Paige smiled at me and told me to keep my eyes on the night. I almost choked on a piece of plastic while Jason’s footsteps reappeared from the depths of Crystal Lake. As I’m here now, I think of Paige’s words again. She was not the only person to do that. I stick it in my coat pocket and pull out the envelope that arrived in my mailbox three weeks ago. It came late on Saturday morning, and there was no postmark or return address on the mailbox at all. That told me that I knew it had brought it to the mailbox and put it in the mailbox . I started to read it, I thought that was a joke. An awful thing: I ’m sorry for somebody who had seen all the characters he and I watched in the murders at Camp Mirror , and that was the one playing on me. But as I read and reread it, my gut s became numb – that it was real, and that was more terrifying than anything. I take out the letter as I sit very at the spot where <extra_id_27> part of me also died . A part that, as hard as I tried, I could share. It’s not about my life. I unfold the letter and read it for the thousandth time. I’m sorry, I don’t know if you believe me or if you even care, but I have to say it. I should never say them. I didn’t have to know. That’s what you are saying. I’m sorry. I should never say them. It was about what I had to be doing. I want to tell you all this. I’m sorry. But I have a story. Not something I can share with you. I think you know what it is about me, but it can make up for what I did. Maybe you have money, strength, power, whatever you want. Whatever you want, meet me at the place where it happened and I’ll show you the way it happened. If not, I’ll assume you never will be. It was from Kyle.
