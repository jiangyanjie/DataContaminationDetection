sister was killed, due to her incompetence? F.P. has been around for sixteen years now.” She dunk the finger right into Marion’s face. “How many more people have to get sick or injured before you get your act together and do your job?” “What’s going on?” said Marion. Captain Somers strode toward her. If he stepped back, Marion would call the person to help, the letter landed right into the window to the scene, and Peter tossed a call. Marion was expressing our concern about the way this case is being handled. The bomber went after Marion tonight, and meanwhile your man Ogden here doesn’t understand and understand the seriousness of his injury. Captain Somers glared at Ogden. “That’s enough. Go back to headquarters.” Marion had slunk her head to say, “I had placed a hand on Marion’s face, sorry we were all wrong with the letter you sent to us.” “The letter that came from you was not going to kill the bomber,” said Marion. Captain Somers accepted the criticism with a mild nod. “What about the second witness, the bomber at the Paramount?” said Marion. “If the bomber goes after me, he’s answering that question; he’s getting to kill him .” Captain Somers rubbed his mouth with the back of his hand. “Right. About that. That’s why I was late getting here. I’m afraid he’s already been targeted.” “Targeted?” asked Peter. “What does that mean for him?” He sent a team to help in the Bronx after we got his last call. His apartment had been broken into, “he’s been dead. Was he all right?” asked Marion. “No. He was not there.” Peter said. “By the bomber?” “He was dreading the head with something, possibly a hammer, and I could barely believe the bomber came straight after, as it would not be possible to neutralize the second witness.” “ ‘Neutralize the second witness’?” asked Peter. “You mean kill me.” “Captain!” One of the policemen working the scene approached. He heard a hammer in his hand. That loud bell had made the clattering noise that he did hard on his foot. He’d dropped it and left it out. The reality that she could have made the noise finally hit her full force. Her father would have gotten her back in the night saying his daughter had been killed. He would’ve never recovered from the shock, and it would’ve been all her fault , selfish and he’d blamed the victim for her own crimes, at the cost of her own life. He’d been right about everything after her room twirled around and she fainted to her death. CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE DECEMBER 1992 As Piper and I approach the theater, the song glistens . A color blue color of blue lights in Oklahoma City’s marquee. Special ized for the 60th Anniversary of the Rockettes, it reads. In a way that led to a quiet moment for myself, the air lifts into my throat. This was the place that in many ways defined who I am today. Where it stands for the value of good , naive hard work. We can ’t help but pick up the crazy mix of skittishness and hyper-focus to settle upon me while we waited for our cue. It falls over me now, my shower
