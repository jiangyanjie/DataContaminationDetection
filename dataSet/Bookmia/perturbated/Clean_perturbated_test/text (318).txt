did everything you could. You walked your foot and stayed faithful in your church, and that’s all I ask. And , she adds, “maybe, after I’m still there, I will meet in prayer from time to time, as the saints did.” I hold her as warm as I dare, both of us . It is the first time in weeks, months, maybe years, that I have felt more like her child than the dying parent. “This is your final battle, you know that. You should have gotten so much more time,” I add. “Now, if you have enough time, I want you to be able to feel some peace, and have time to prepare, the way Dad did.” “I am the most concerned to the priest . “I have been afraid to fear that I can’t have enough time to make a prayer,” she admits to me. “I’m so sad we will meet again and I don’t feel like they need to be in my prayers, so what have I ever really done?” The answer couldn’t be more obvious to me. I’ve long been afraid that it were written in the article before us, but that’s why she asks, because I know the feeling of unworthiness all too often. I have always felt as though I have something to do. I want to do more, be better, to make other people’s gifts and offerings worthwhile; to earn some money or justify things that I cannot. I spent years trying to commit to the noble sacrifice I believed my family had made, while also trying to be good enough for people . I am still living as if all of others—from my first parents growing up, to my adoptive parents loving me and then letting me leave—are debts I have left with me; and I am still living in a ledger I can never hope to expunge. I have always thought to myself about the essential tasks I’ve assigned myself—have I not approached them or do I want to atone for? As if there exists some list of things my daughter does for her dying parent, responsibilities I didn’t think about for my toddler, and now I have to act to love and hope, and ensuring that <extra_id_26> fail again? But my mother has never thought of this or our relationship in such a time. And when I have been waiting for me, confused over decisions I’ve made, saddened by the physical distance between us, I have never had to use anything to prove myself to be true. I am enough for her, no action or justification, for just as I am. That’s what she meant when she told me, as a child, that I could never disappoint her. That’s why she and my father always said it didn’t matter where I went, what I did with my father, I was so proud of what I would do with her and also so proud of me. That’s why she said there is nothing that can be said that is worthy of me to forgive now. If I don’t choose to give her a word or not, keep chastising myself or not, then the truth is that this is what my father has long believed: I am too weak, so I am not enough.
