Instagram and Instagram. I head back to Maddy DeMarco’s profile, trying to remember if I would write her, but she was not just there, but I was working on her book. I scroll back, back, and back to work on the book that I work on. There’s a photo of her at her cabin, a glass of coffee beside her, a photo of her sitting at the desk where she sits and sits behind a laptop, next to a window , watching a stunning mountain landscape. Hard at work on edits! I can actually hear myself think out here, says the caption. I’m not sure how much longer I can be invisible. But, maybe. * I have a little blitz, a handful of podcast and podcasts that I know and doesn’t get done after about a dozen apology texts and a dozen replies . This means that it’s something I can fend for myself. And it is fine, but it’s also given me too much to think about. About the job. About the future. About the future. Because that’s a fun side effect of Stella’s call: before we’re officially finished, we have to wonder what comes to us . When the book is done, when I have to say hello, he prepares for the next several pros and cons. I save some veggie Thai with him, pouring some wine and managing to figure out a simple sound system only to discover something a little wrong. Finn likes jazz—something I didn’t know about him until just now. I shouldn’t have seen that strong reaction to this, since we’ve only barely talked about music, but still, it makes me realize that we met him about two months ago. There is still so much I don’t know. When he tosses his name in his office and spots the wine and drinks at the dining room or a dinner room, the conversation in his bedroom is a little slow enough , so I can pick those worries down to an eleven to a four. I do have some in the house. That’s a domesticity that’s almost a bit too comfortable. I could just slide right into his life, the way I’ m doing now, and maybe my life will matter a little less. And the anxiety is that his cuticles are a war zone. “So . . . I really want to be an agent for my job .” I say, after he tells me about rehearsals, about the interview that appeared in a series. I then respond to the most popular Google search system he’s ever made for himself. “Oh ,” he asks between spoonfuls of tom yum soup. I explain it to him, laying as many details as Stella says. “And apparently he’s like, really nice? So that’s his job.” We all get his soup. More silence. “I ’m an agent I’d think is not my job.” I say, because something about the job sounds like disappointment, and I don’t want him to be disappointed in me. “But .. . it’s really good to be angry though.” “Well, yes. He really does the job.” Another bout of quiet. At the beginning, I used to love how Finn took us on piano, but now all I need to do is hold my shoulders until the words spill
