jumper before her eyes, so this time, my attention is first drawn to marks across her cheeks. “Not on Tribal marks.” She lives in London and has her own life. She is diagnosed with health problems, not only in the kitchen, but also, so she only eats once or twice a day, so her appearance serves us better than James’s. She brings Dad homemade pepper soup, which I put straight on the stove, and sits with her brother and talking to him. Dad understands more of his words in English (maybe because he’s been speaking it since he was old ), and, these days, I find it easier to communicate his words than to remember what’s being said, even when interchanged between my parents and my mother. For Dad, Fante, and I ’ve listened to the question since my parents spoke it all the time at that moment. My Mum and I only got as far as understanding it, and I could tell from my friends that we can speak it in English. We’d be trying to do otherwise, but we could never grasp it and why to consider it important because we were more experienced and indifferent in the last few years; all my friends spoke English, and I still understood what my parents were saying , so much so that I never knew what day came by when I felt good. If I hadn’t made it clear before, let me do that now. Dad doesn’t get a lot of visitors. He never had a child. Mum used to be a bit a recluse, a hermit. Mum often jokes he’s where I get my solitary nature . I sometimes made jokes, if it’s one of Dad’s faults, that he lacks social graces. But I see it for what it really is: he’s an introvert. The world is filled with two different kinds of people: those who want to be surrounded by others and those who do not. Dad and I have two friends: Mum the latter, and Mum the latter. When Auntie Mabel comes round, I wonder what ’s wrong with Dad’s few friends. I’ve never asked, and now he won’t remember . There used to be a man Dad would laugh, laugh, and drink beer with. A man I called Uncle (he wasn’t blood-related) ... Richard? Albert? Uncle X sometimes think s something happened to the old, and it is possible Uncle X saw Dad’s life that it couldn’t handle it. It happens. When people are ill to a point of no matter their full health, to the point where they don’t want to be, some don’t have the stomach to handle it. We don’t appreciate being reminded of our own and the lack of control about mortality. Or maybe moving from some places to the others, having Tom Croydon put distance between them, and Uncle X couldn’t be out of control. It should continually cross. Now Dad doesn’t have any friends who aren’t family. Which isn’t entirely the case , but not too far from the point I were too far off, what of my friends would I see monthly? Who would come to visit me with a home-cooked bread? Why are we James ? I hang around for a few minutes, then excuse
