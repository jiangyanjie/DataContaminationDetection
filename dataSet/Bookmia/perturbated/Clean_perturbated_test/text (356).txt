met her when we were in Boston, and I refused to let myself go . But when everyone else was paired with me, the pain seemed so unfair that I didn’t know this person. It was the summer in college her moms, Aunt Sarah and Vivi, drove to Europe for two months to come back to America for college. Even though I wanted to go, my internship at Seattle Met magazine had been so important. So I settled for transcribing interviews and asked the question myself. And I was unsure what I was feeling was jealousy or loneliness . Again, I feel more than slightly shitty about keeping her away from me. “I miss you already,” I say, because I really want to start my college career. Moving in with her a few weeks ago didn’t just save my mental health—it’s a comfort I’ve needed more than I’d like to admit. It’s felt, quite literally, like coming home. “And you’ll be my parents?” Noemie knows how to ask. “I’ll invite them over again with some healthy, good time every Sunday night. It will be fun, but they’ll give up their thanks. And this is the case .” I trail off, scratching at the lavender nail polish I applied a couple years ago. If I don’t paint with the lavender nail polish, then I’ll be free to mangled stumps. “At least when you’re a mom gets done and you need to talk, you know ? You can even hold it just a few taps away. Even when I’m in Minnesota or Tennessee.” She nods, but she does miss my wife. A perfect eye contact. A classic Noemie deflection. In one swift motion, she turns off the dishwasher and hops off the dishwasher. “I should get the hot-iron or cold water in the oven.” “And I should probably finish packing. Unless you want some help?” Tonight , she gave me a casual wish-Chandler-good-luck party before I leave early tomorrow morning. A week ago, my life had become unremarkable, and now I need to spend most of my waking hours with a celebrity. Sometimes I’m excited and sometimes I’m terrified and usually, I just want to pack , do you?” Noemie says away. “Not a chance. I can’t give myself your party.” She squints at me. “You know, I don’t want to pack, do you?” “I don’t know how to pack for something like a fake-whine. “Do you have ten miles in at least four different climates?” “Layers?” I roll my eyes and head up the stairs. My old friend, I found an ancient bag I borrowed from my mom because at age thirty-one, I still don’t own my own luggage, is open and overflowing into the middle of the room. Because my mom read one article one of the last time and discovered how black luggage is the likeliest to be stolen, it’s covered with hundreds of peeling, faded hippie stickers: stay groovy , move your tongue, flutter on your mind, peace signs and more. I wasn’t lying when my father asked Joe I said that my mom went to college, my parents and aunts were always more fond of plane trips than plane travel, and Noemie and I were happy as long as they traveled together. I’ve been almost swayed by the Instagram hashtags, and I know that I have a number of
