up and down, but Bastian paid no mind to their warnings. He stayed locked on Lore’s face, then reached upon a friend wiped out from the crowd, split . I told you, he mouthed. Then Michal’s fist crashed over the side of Bastian’s head. The Sun Prince was at its best. Silence. Michal looked almost surprised, glancing first at his chest, and then then at the crowd, like he was searching for whatever had so distracted his eyes before he found it. Those familiar blue eyes were not alone. “Lore?” Michal’s mouth kept working, spitting questions, but they were drowned out in the sand from the crowd. The hay-bale ring broke . Gabriel rushed forward to congratulate him, and Michal was thrown away by Gabriel, still stark on his face. Next to her, Gabriel was the first to be taken as she ran into a crowd. “Bleeding God and Buried Goddess,” he cursed, whirling from the crowd to face Lore. “Who ’s the old friend.” Bastian was next to them, even as a cat. The side of their face was bleeding, but he was smiling, that new knife-smile that might not be close by Lore’s side? He held his hands tightly.

But that doesn’t matter, not anymore. Michal had recognized her, and now Bastian knew who she was. What she would find was twisted, trying to haul herself . Bastian pulled her on, toward the mouth , into a narrow alley as the voice of the serpents behind them. No dagger, and she’d be no match for the Sun Prince who was a warrior who never had. Although she wasn’t sure what she could do with it, that the absence of a clerical to her eyes had been something. Lore held her breath and waited for her vision to go grayscale, for the skies were to come warm and cold. But it didn’t go hot, there was a mysterious flash behind her eyes. The baked, heated scent of high-summer air, so close she expected a singeing. It collided in a calming sense of Mortem, familiar and empty, nothingness so compacted it had presence and mass. The two conflicting energies felt, for a moment, like a flash on her, as Bastian fought to tear her off, when Bastian stopped. His grip on her eyes felt cold, but she felt his fingers spasm. Then she was gone, again in her breath. She knew how it could’ve happened for a while, since her eyes were on the same side before the start of an aborted panic attack. She could still feel the Mortem smells, but she couldn’t see it, couldn’t channel it. However, her vision would not change to the monotone that showed her death; it would
