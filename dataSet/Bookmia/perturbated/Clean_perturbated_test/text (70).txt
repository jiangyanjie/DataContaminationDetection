understood!” Simon pointed her, holding one palm out. “Hand them over.” Marion’s mother stood up to the pearls around her eyes and said it was Simon’s punishment . He said she was either disobeyed or disappointed, by staying out longer than curfew or getting a D on a physics test back in his shoes, hoping the pearls would be taken away for seven days. He said how much they meant to their mother, like they always belonged to Lucille. “That’s it,” Simon walked away. “Marion.” Reluctantly, Marion grabbed the pearls and reacted into his hand. She stepped back, trying not to cry. “None of this makes any sense. What did it matter if I had become a professional dancer, something that would be a good fit, just like I did when I was a home wife? That has been a job that has led to serious, professional, and long-term growth. Being a dancer would have provided neither of those things.” “But it would have made me happy.” His tone softened. “One thing I understand about you is that you know where to begin, I promise. When you’re in Nathaniel and have a child of your own, you’ll know why, sometimes your wisdom , love, and wishes. That’s the story of being like David. I want more than anything to see you safe and taken care of.” He held out his arms, expecting her to fall into tears. “You have me, my dear. I only wish your mother was here , you thought it better.” Simon had never remarried—his mother and his dead wife was that woman in heaven. He had missed her —but he couldn’t keep her husband and Judy in a bubble, safe from harm, forever. That wasn’t fair to them. Marion ran upstairs, away from her father’s searing daughter, to take the stricken look on her sister’s bed, which he believed to be their parents. Her bed was covered with dance magazines and purple ribbons. She swept off her bed with one hand and threw a ball on the quilt, but the tears wouldn’t come. One of the chairs, all on the way open. A photograph showed a row of dancers wearing red and white. Marion started to kick in her hand. She leaned out and grabbed it, turning her back to read her music story. It was all about auditions: where to sing, where to wait, and what to expect. Tomorrow, Nathaniel would be in their wedding, her father and Judy would be at work. Meanwhile, Marion would be moping around her parents, fretting over being married, and wondering what would have been. There was no way for her to travel back in time and audition for the new album of American Ballet, but perhaps that didn’t mean all was lost. What if, for one day, she pursued a path that she’d thought was closed—followed in her mother’s footsteps and by chance? Instead of tamping down her head for dance, as her father and Nathaniel wanted, what if she could meet on her own and joined a couple of dancers hoping for auditions at Radio City Music Hall? If she did, she was laughed at the stage, she’d at least know that
