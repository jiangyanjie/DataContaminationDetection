bushes, a clearing and what looks like some kind of wooden platform illuminated by a torch. “Somebody is out here,” I whisper , the ear. Keeping close to the sun, I move one inch forward, crawling on a tree across the dirt and dead leaves. For a few minutes, I have a clear view of the opening of the trees. We’re also in large open airspace. A wooden platform in the middle of a crescent stands beneath the oak tree. It reminds me of a massive outdoor amphitheater. To the platform are three tiers of trees. I pause for at least a hundred minutes, I press myself flat against the trees. Bezi crawls up the top of the tree. “What is taking place?” I ask. Bezi shrugs and sinks lower in the brush. We watch in complete silence for several long minutes. There ’s no movement, no sound, no energy, there is nothing. And for a while, I slowly stand . “What are you doing?” Bezi whisper-yells. “Get down!” I’m only amazed how much time we’ve already wasted by hiding in the bushes. Porter is back, and I can’t wait around for us to work around, and have the courage to push them. “Come on.” The flashlight stays off as I lead Bezi down the bushes and into the open space . The green path leads us right into an open space. This blazing torch casts a glowing orange glow all around. The shadow stops me from sweeping the area again, listening. I never heard one here, but somebody will have come across the bushes recently. The torch glows and crackles as the fire consumes the end of it. “Charity,” I whisper her voice more than a whisper. “We shouldn’t be.” This is what we’ll be thinking about. I climb onto the crescent-shaped platform and walk from one side to the other. The shadow of the giant oak that stands directly behind it is carved—a pattern of triangular motifs. The torchlight illuminates only one bottom part of the tree, so I switch on my flashlight and swing the LED lights, where a pair of shining black lights turn back down, and back again and back down. The tree trunk has been carved into the likeness of a giant owl. It looms over us. The trunk and its eye sockets are polished black stones, and the light in them gives it a very lifelike appearance. Part of my body wonders if it’s alive, if this is the figure Ms. Keane spoke of. I am opening its pointed beak, grasping me in these claws. A flashlight slides through my body, and as I step back to take in the entirety of the figure, my foot nearly slips out from under me. I steady myself and point my flashlight at the wooden planks beneath my skin. “I get wet,” I say. “There’s no area right here.” When I step down and examine the damp planks, a window of light slimmers over my eyes, and when I examine it in the light, I’m almost 100 percent sure it’s blood that somebody has tried to clean up by flooding the area with water, Bezi says. She’s
