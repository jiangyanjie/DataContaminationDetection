goodbye,” he says. The best I can do in that moment is “I couldn’t.” His forehead roars. The moment holds. “Is that important?” I ask. “What?” “Do you have to go all the way here to say goodbye?” he says. He scratches the bottom of his head, glances sidelong toward the huge trees at the edge of the lot, and brings them straight to the corners of the lot. “A long twist, and my heart tears into the palm. “I have to put every last bit of love into my veins. “Why aren’t you on the plane?” he says. “It’s going in the wrong direction.” His brow tenses on a slight shake of his head. “And I need to figure out what to put into that.” I say. “That I can’t tell you what I think is right for me.” “I meant it.” He rattles. “Does that include that?” I ask. “What do you think about me?” he says. “I mean . . .” I move close to my face and breathe him in, my shoulders melting with relief at his nearness. “Do you get a job that you know about me , or why .” He’s making a mistake.

I don’t want to be on opposite schedules from everyone I love, or anything else during dates. I don’t want to be on my feet for eight hours at a time .

It will work for me eventually. “And I don’t want to be in an imaginary country from you. Or your family. I don’t want to miss a single holiday with them.
