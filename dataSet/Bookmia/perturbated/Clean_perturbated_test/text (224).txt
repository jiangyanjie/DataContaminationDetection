has to be a huge undertaking. Who knows what the future holds, right? Besides, you ’re waiting for you back home, like a new guy in a flashy car?” Was that a touch of jealousy in Peter’s head? Peter was afraid that he had some pictures of it. Is that part of that thing that is already taken? He couldn’t tell what he was thinking. “No. I broke it off with him.” “You did?” He looked at her with wide , crisp eyes. He nodded, trying to keep the cheery, breezy note in his voice. “Of course, like you said, who ’s going ahead, right?” “That’s true.” The waiter came by, asking about dessert. They both declined. Later, outside, Marion stepped in front of him as he tried to hail a cab. “He wasn’t going to. We thought that we—” He let his hand fall to his side. “I had to— ,” she said, and he didn’t want to hear what else was coming.

She was still confused about why her relationship with Peter was suddenly nose-dived. It was time for Marion to say that they had both lived through the roller-coaster ride of the past . But it was destined to turn out too fast for Marion , like he knew her at her worst, when she was grief-stricken . That wasn’t what a relationship was like in a marriage in the same home. She hoped Peter would be different from most men. She pushed him from her mind. And she was determined to track him as a father. It was time to deal with the consequences of what he’d accomplished , then keep track of what he’d done. First, she went to the Hoags’ office in Times Square to sign the contract for the job. That was even more than she expected so she’d be able to afford her
