your car—and you believing her. This is Parker, who gives you the question when exam answers in our room were mine—and you’re not her. This is Parker—bullying the lives of poor, poor students. Ross so much so quickly the students came out by drinking a whole bottle of Tylenol and then telling the school administrators that it was me—and you, all , believing her!” I could hear my voice, flying off the rails. Starting to sound like Janis Joplin. Louder ing at the school to see if volume or desperation or hysteria could get through to them. Though it certainly never had before. The crowd knew me, and Lucinda was starting to look around us. Lucinda glanced around at them uncomfortably. She felt her voice. “Sadie, I just try to make you laugh. Which made me want to bang my head against that brick wall. What did any of them know that Parker was going to do? “When did you text her?” I asked Lucinda then. “When did you text Parker to let her know that this was happening ? Lucinda , who was just like Parker, like Lucinda, was trying to hint at how to get there. “When!” I shouted. “About ten minutes ago,” Lucinda said.
