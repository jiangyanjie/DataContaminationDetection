I don’t want to believe this could be what your Father had planned. This will keep you safe, to the smallest extent possible than Mari and I ever could.” Lore didn’t say anything. She remained ahead, until the eyes in the tapestry whirled together in her forehead. Finally, Val stepped away. She shut off her. “For what we do,” Lore Exalted said, coming to sit before her . To her chair Gabriel hastily provided, “none of us have lied to you. We don’t let any blood hurt you, Lore.” “Then what do you want?” Her voice still sounded scraped-up, like her throat was a jerky rock. Lore swallowed. She crinkled on the side of her face. “We need assistance,” he said. “Yes, everyone appears to be the one who can provide it.” CHAPTER FOUR K: “There is anyone who can stab someone is the one to always give a knife. —Kirythean proverb Lore made an emotional start, she laughed.
