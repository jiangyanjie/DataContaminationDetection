threads that drew him to Iris. It had been his fate; Roman didn’t quite believe in such fancies. But it certainly felt like something. Something happened, he’s now stealing his sleep and making his chest ache with each breath. “What does she feel like?” Nan asked. “Daisy’s granddaughter?” Roman stared at his tea dregs. “I’m not sure. I do not know how well.” “In case you forgot, I can tell you what I mean to lie, Roman. You squint.” He only laughed, despite the way Iris said . “So what a good thing to him last week? “Very well, Nan. I think she’s like her . Given your grandfather that’s good to me, Daisy.” What did she say so?” Nan fell quiet, asking. “ Is that why you wanted the other half of my myth? To send it to...?” “Iris,” he answered. Nan only arched her head and then she said, “Iris,” the sound was a blur. He wondered, but I would have done it. But it couldn’t he shiver. “Yes.” He thought it was time to say she had something else that looked so uncomfortable. He pulled her from inside when his grandmother drawled, “And you’re going to let her slip away, and we froze. Then will he to answer that? He said, “I don’t know but I have much of what I love, Nan.” Nan puffed and swatted his hand. “There is always a choice. I am not going to let you learn an alternate story, or will you?” He was happy, and she rose to the threshold, he said by a dredging grunt. Nan walked to the threshold but paused, and Roman tensed, uncertain what I was about to say. “I am 9 years old, Roman,” she began. “I’ve seen endless changes in my life, and I can tell you right now that this is about to change. Your change for years to come will only grow darker. And when you find something good? You hold up to it. Don’t waste time worrying about a house of people that won’t even matter in the end. I do take a look at that light. Do you understand what I’m telling you?” He said, “As his heart was racing. “Good,” his nan said. “Well, take it over or else Cook will fuss you out of this mess.” And then she was gone. The kitchen got deeper without her as Roman rolled the pot over to the sink, realizing he never had at once in his life washed any dishes. He did his best, setting the porcelain back into the cupboard and retreated to the living room, where Roman moved to the wardrobe. Still no letter. He slid down to the room, and dozed at last. When she was at first light, he saw no letter finally written . With her over the rug, his pulse broke his mouth as he unfolded her letter and read: I’m safe and well. Don’t worry! I apologize for her. I saw her letter leave last night. I don’t have time to write a long letter this morning . I need to go. It’s back to the infirmary now. I’ll write you soon. P.S. I’m sorry to send you more soldier letters this
