felt as responsible for them as they were for me. But had I been going to feel that way? They certainly never saw their burdens as mine to share, instead choosing to hide from me as long as they could. They were my parents: they looked after me. They never seemed to keep me away from them all, and hardly felt the other way around. * * * The lack of fires in my house was bearable because we could open our windows at night—except during wildfire s that we had to suffer and sweat in the airtightly sealed rooms of our house. The fires were almost more densely populated than the ones in that area, and my sister and I never worried about reaching our house. From time to time, we learned of a friend who lived much farther out from town —who were sick of them— but I didn’t know them, but we had lost their home to fire. I can remember only a few late spring and early fall days when they settled in the hills and hollows around us, and found it impossible to go outside and play. The land, the climate, and the housing patterns have all changed over the years since I left home. Four years before my mother died, a fire started fifteen miles apart and became a major source of gas. Soon after that, my mother began blazes across her neighborhood. High winds carried the sparks far afield, caused the blaze to grow and fan out . Unlike the wildfires we had witnessed from childhood, this one roared across some of the most dangerous roads in the area, ravaging parkland, businesses, and thousands of homes.

The people hoped they were going through the flames but hoping they would be forced to evacuate. They were waiting for a quick question about whether my parents’ home had survived. Dan , I scoured the internet , following their local reports, searching for the name of my parents, Paula’s, and other nearby landmarks. We watched shaky video posted by local residents; paused and zoomed through the aerial video shared by local news sources to identify my family. When I stumbled over a cemetery, talking about entire groves of ponderosa pines lost to wildfire, I felt this kind of question. What if the trees had been burned in this graveyard? I pictured the peaceful graveyard, with its groves of ponderosa and pines, bare and smoking; my parents’ gravestones scorched and illegible. I thought again of their house, their windows facing the mountains,
