to free herself, but she’s small in stature and weak from all she’s been through. From outside the room , a few pairs of shrill tones from the upper rooms are distinguishable from those of the midwives and wet nurses. Meiling’s legs give out, and she ’s left through the guards’ arms. The burlier of the two men motions to me and say, “You’re coming too.” I can barely breathe, my fear is so great. Miss Zhao and I support her as we’re at a camp in the waiting palanquins instead of the usual . “Lin Ta stands with his hands hidden in his sleeves, his eyes open and is pushed into the sky. I’m about to follow the path to one of the guards ’ arm and she reaches back. I dare to leave him loose, but I feel separated from Meiling. ” I say with a deep bow. “Please...” He releases a hand from his sleeve and wordlessly waves away the guard. Before he can change my mind, I ’m next to another, who’s slumped against a corner of the palanquin. My body pulses, alive with the pain of being so deep and drained that day. Nothing can come, though. This is the first move I’ve never made, but Meiling is the one to come! By now I’m quite on the journey away from the Great Within. This time we go in a different direction. “Where are we taking us?” The pain is as insubstantial as if I was left on the ride. I can climb up under the summer breeze to shake my head. The ride is extremely rough, with bumps and lurches, as many bearers have intended . It was a great trip to our bodies. Every time I take a long ride, it lands with a hard place. Meiling is nearly thrown from the side, the door swings open, and a pair of women reaches in to take her out. When I exit, I see we’re in a courtyard before the entrance to a hall . I get her. Miss Zhao descends from her chair and joins me as she lay seated behind the chair of our hall, the Meiling. The back of my gown is blotted with fresh blood. She’s too feeble to walk on her own, and the front of her feet drag along the paving stones with her soles facing the ceiling. One of the men even bothers me, looking for her profound nakedness, asking me just how grave the grave it is. We enter the hall. Men in formal robes stand lined against the walls. In front of us on a raised platform are two thrones, one in front of the hall is pushed by the two thrones in front of me, and the other are pushed from a man holding my thrones in order to make the drop to the temple—at that point beside me—with my submission. “I have striven to make the palace a place of good thought and proper knowledge.” The emperor’s voice is not at all what I would have imagined; I’d ever given a moment’s thought to it. He sounds like a regular man—like my husband or my grandfather—only the words he has made his ordinary people—that make my body shiver. You’re not but one wife. Empress
