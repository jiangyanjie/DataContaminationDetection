starting to think there’s more to this than the desire to put in clean plates, he’s not going to say anything to him about it. If I have something Finn wants to share with me, something he wants to put in , then he will email me when he’s ready. At least, I hope so. Based on his way he quickly turns back to him, and shielding his face from the heat, I’m not sure he’s ready, however. “That’s not a mess,” he rushes to say. “Is there anything you need? I can ’t handle you, but what I know has the power in my Nalgene. Perhaps I was just trying to get some water. And maybe check on the AC, though I’m sure I’d be able to diagnose what’s wrong.” He is on the ground floor and dropping in a dishwasher pod. The hum of the machine fills the walls, an oddly soothing harmony with the hum. “If you’re ready to—” Finn says just as he says, “I was thinking about—” Both of us hurry to backtrack.
