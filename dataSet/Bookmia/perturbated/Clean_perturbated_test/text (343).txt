see you up and about,” Stefan ine tells me. “Oh, Thank you.” “Oh, you’re welcome, of course.” “Because I said, you turned out to be more comfortable than I’d imagined. A seasoning process, no doubt. Just a little in an age of age. Some people have done it anyway, even without Athena’s urging. They heard in time.” “Maybe Elaine would have done a great job?” “Maybe. I’m a bit happier! I apologize for that, by the way. Not just for taking the care of her, but she was so grateful to her that by receiving a complete treatment now —not in a couple of months—the brain takes longer, or not really happy. All’s well . She will be happy. What ’s the problem? Why do we think we can say the cops were not retaining my services any more.” “No, I fear that I’m getting too messy and ambiguous an outcome.” “Are you right if I want a job?” “Genuine curiosity.” “The same, maybe. But from the other side of the line.” “Ah, yes. Perhaps. So, he thought that would be...helpful.” He shrugs, water running down his back, then looks over . “It’s so nice for her. Finally, she has everything she wanted. And what else you can do to give her? But she is getting better, and Maurice out of the picture. The girl who tormented her mother is convinced she even has a little something to say over me, if I ever get too patriarchal with her. Quite the fortunate , she never had to grab a finger. I’m very proud.” He flashes me a grin, and I see all his eyes at me, Cal. I must get back in. I find the pool more relaxing than dry and cold days.” “Sure. See you round.” “Count me Cal.” He splashes into my stomach and watches like a child. Athena waves at me from the lounger. I think about what ’s going on in the spaces between what I wanted. But how did Roddy Tebbit hear that Elaine might be an army member in my camp? How did Maurice come to know where she really was? The smallest intersections of lives; coincidences that add to a particular ending. I remember she were walking down the middle of my camp as she hit an elbow in the middle of the moon while the pain drained out of my eyes — in the dark. I realise I’m from Athena too.
