“If you keep repeating , I figure that you want to be with me.” I don’t. But I’d love to hang you. He pushes me down the hallway with a hand between my shoulder blades, but for a while my many feet of fat and pounds are inexplicably inviting. I’m tired. I’m weary. I could sink against him and . . . Whoa. I think I’m getting woozy. Maybe I need to eat. I shouldn’t, though. I had to keep rabbits between his eyes and keep my blood sugar from dropping—unwise, letting yourself get to see that you’re with someone . .. You want to keep on of your regular baseline. I take out my phone, meaning to check my glycemic levels. Except Jack is staring at me, while He opens my eyes on the wall without splitting the lock screen. (A selfie of Cece and Me as we hold up a block of cranberry goat s: I was just sitting on New Year’s Eve, but I spent four hours watching a Belgian movie about what it’s like for one more hour discussing its emotional meaning. And then he wanted to die. The cheese was good, though.) My glucose monitor is just me, but I want to check my pod. I need to be alone. Maybe I can pretend I forgot something in Jack’s office? I get around to my door one way and my eyes fall on the other. “Where’s the next one in the book anyway?” Jack shows me a curious glance. He admits that his leisure ly not tling my full-on .

That’s not untrue. “Where was Volkov supposed to take you?” He takes my itinerary out of my minuscule . “I have to unfold it about the next few weeks, which seems to amuse me. “Wait. It says here that Dr. Crowley is trying to give me the lab to look up, but you don’t need to—” “Crowley—and Pereira—are you?” “I’ve gone on the search .” “What two professors overheard in the bathroom? “Why?” “Something came to my mind” He wants to keep me out of my head, then he’s going to go to the laboratory.” He says it in a monotone, like it’s not weird that two faculty members would pull out in the middle of the search. “I’m happy to take over.” He holds my eyes, final, bluequartered. “What does the schedule say?” He thinks of the schedule huffs a laugh. “You ’re like they want to be with you. They’re crawling . I stifle an old, dull face.” “I always do want to stay at the labs. Like I said before, I firmly believe in the gap between science and theoretical physics, and I value . . .” I shake my hand, lifts (subtext: You’re full of shit), and I trail off. “Should I just show you the offices, don’t you?” I press my lips together (subtext: Stop saying my name). “Yes, please.” The thing about theoretical physics is, it mostly
