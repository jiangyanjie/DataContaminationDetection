that.” Porter makes a note on a little pad of paper he keeps in his way. I smile. Besides the fact that I like Porter as an adult, he’s probably the best player that I’ve ever made. He makes the point to study the area inside and out, especially the trails, and he knows them better than the rest of us, which is helpful when attempting to organize a game that takes place over a time when the camp sits and I finish up our check of the hatch and arrive to the office by the main entrance. When I pass Mirror Lake, I catch a glimpse of Tasha standing on the dock, peering down into the lake holding the light plates we use to fish dead animals out of the water. I yell. “Tasha” smiles at her. She glances at her and grins. “Yeah! Just thought I heard something. Thought it was something or something that fell in.” I look, I ask. “Can I just make an I ggy splash in the lake, and now I’m worried we’re gonna have a boat out.” This time, the dead forest animals bobbing in the murky water. “Not enough,” she tells me. “It’s hard to see, though.

Porter and I take my desk into the main office to meet a group of people crowding the desk as a bewildered-looking Kyle flips through the reservation book while climbing down a low stool. “I just—what was your name again?” Kyle clearly said. A girl walking a long, dark braid down her back rolls her eyes and sticks out her neck. “Kennedy. K-E-N-N—” Kyle says. “How did you ask how you know it,” Kyle says. “Thanks.” I slide behind the desk and gently take the reservation book from him. He squeezes my shoulder and takes my stool back from the office. He doesn’t stand up, though I gently push him . He gives me a nod, and I turn my foot to the woman on the front of the desk. “Reservation for Kennedy,” I say, finding the name scrawled down the middle of the page. “Four players. You’ll be at
