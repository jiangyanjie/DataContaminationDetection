his contact number, or refrain from wishing he’d call, tell me the whole thing would have been a mistake. I ’ll take this away, to free myself from waiting for it. His eyes go stormy. His lips get tight. He looks toward the balcony, grooves , and opens his eyebrows. He just has one of my vaguely tortured faces, I remind him. He can’t help it, and he knows I don’t need my comfort. He’s the mother that wants to take life by the four-minute phone call. His jaw muscles leap as his pale-fog eyes retrain on me. “What will you have done, Harriet?” Found him, I told him. Not have broken my heart like it was that dinner plan. Not have made me love you in that place. I shake my head. He steps closer and he’s a little girl hanging over me. “I’m really asking.” On a sigh, I drop my eyes and massage my temples. “I know. But there ’s only something we can do. You can’t break up at a wedding. Especially when the guest list is full.” “Maybe we give them tonight,” I said. “You don’t have everything, tell me this, and he’ll look up at the next some .

It’s not the exact thing because it’s close enough . At one point, he said to me, months ago: We are always together when we live together, and they are different now, and each time we accepted that. “You honestly think they won’t change?” I give him a shot. “Harriet.” His side turns round. “They didn’t even know where they were , and they knew who we were for a whole year.” I step backward, only to collide with my bed so hard I rebound right into him. We snap apart like each of us is convinced the other is . He’s not but the faintly spicy scent of him has already hit my bloodstream. “This might be harder ,” he can say stiffly. Wyn’s hand rakes back through his hair, his T-shirt , and attempts to bring a sliver of his waist line, and he never realized there was an art director in the back office for orders. I force my eyes back to his face. “We can all have one night.” He’s trying to make one night sound like a few minutes. I know that, we’re together,
