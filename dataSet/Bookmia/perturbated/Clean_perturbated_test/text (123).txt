I shouldn’t have put that burden on you. I shouldn’t have let it get that heavy. I should have come forward with the whole story. “So soon as that article about you hit the newspaper.” I’m no longer at Hope’s . But a whole little bit from my vision . “You have to flash back to home, my father at the kitchen table, newspaper in hand. He glanced at me with watery eyes and said, “Look what they’re saying’s not true, Kit-Kat.” He didn’t say that because he wanted it to be true. My father said it because it was not true. He said that. He hadn’t given me those pills because he’s the one who took the pills. I can’t help. FORTY-THREE Shock and despair. So that I feel. And it is it. Not grief. Just the extremes of shock that go backwards, feeding off each other, turning into an emotion I can’t describe because I’ve never felt that, and hope that no one else is going to experience it. It feels like every person on the front of me—brain, heart, lungs—has been ripped from it, leaving me hollow. That feeling is true. I see. I can’t think. I can do it. I can’t move. My father, still blessed with all the steps toward me, arms outstretched, as if he wants to embrace me . I’ll shatter it.

She took them willingly. We both knew it had to happen that way. We didn’t intend—what neither of us intended—was for our public health. We knew we would have to be blamed for it. When that happened, I didn’t know what to do. But believe me , I should say I wasn’t going to let Richard Vick arrest you, Kit-Kat. I vowed to turn myself in until the state came and started. But it never got the same, but I stayed quiet, because I said I’d hate me if you ever found out.” I do hate a person, a hate of life, one that eclipses my shock and despair. Those fade with noise as the state takes over. I’m a wounded sort of rage and burning. Like I’m the victim, it’s been stabbed. I can’t tell what hurts more—that my father says that my mother decided to talk about her life without telling me, which gave me a right to say goodbye, or the fact that I stayed silent when he came for help. I was found guilty when I was investigated by the state, when I was suspended from my school. “That’s why I couldn’t talk to you afterward,” my father says. “It was too
