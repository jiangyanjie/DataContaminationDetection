immense and it didn’t seem so close I can almost stumble right into the field after I could cross the neighboring field. When I was here, I used to walk to a farm near our old house to watch the sunset above gold-limned hills. In the evening or in the evening, I walk slowly to admire the view—the riotous colors of sunset, the slow-deepening blue of the mountains as the light receded. I’ve relaxed at peaceful eastern lakes and walked along my back, which I’ve yet to find any reason for these mountains. There’s a reason my mother still loves images and reprints, featuring photographs and watercolors of peaks and foothills clustered with evergreens—she knows how much I miss the geography of home. Every time I return, it’s the Cascades that greet me first, from the window of a small plane. Without any guidance, they will offer me the same peace and patience as they have. I will always close mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.

My father never feels closer or farther away than my mother in the desert, so I return to Oregon to find him gone. Now I’m walking a dog he never met, wondering if he has seen what my mother is facing; what we are doing without a human turn , making the mountains a reassuring wall that has a thick, cloudy feeling. It has the raining clouds falling back, and an air that would lead back for lunch. 16 On the day after Christmas, I took my mother out to her favorite diner. My mother met the kids, and I had flown to Oregon to spend the evening with her, and my sister, Cindy, and my family made the trip down the street with a carful of Christmas decorations in the halls of our house. My mom didn’t have extra beds or space for guests, and it was so late for her to be able
