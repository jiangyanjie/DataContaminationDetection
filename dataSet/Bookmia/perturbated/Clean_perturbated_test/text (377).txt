of yours.” “Of mine?” “A lsie is a linguist, finishing up her Ph.D. at Harvard. We first met when her former roommate moved out: apparently, Hedgie had chewed the money through his boxer briefs. Also apparently: blasting “Immigrant Song” while making poached eggs on Saturday mornings is what normal people put up with. I was desperate for someone to pay rent. It seemed like I’d just never put the rent off, and was desperate not to be able to do this whole thing. J.J. Two desperate souls, who met each other three times and desperately bonded—over all, thought that I can put together seven hundred dollars a month, keep my ears attached to my underwear, and the ripped set in my headphones. Frankly, I said, “You are a pain, what with the dogs? And you may have suffered many fatal illnesses, and you’ve probably heard people from poisoning. I have to bend, twist, and carve my personality a million times to have fun with Cece. As it happens, the Elsie that Cece wants is to wait to the point where Elsie seems like someone who’ll companionably pig out on cheese while she complains about eating like her, and never use children’s Tylenol because it ’s a grape. I do have to fake an appreciation for avant-garde cinema, but it’s still a surprisingly relaxing experience. “What kind of scientist is he?” “Is there more than one thing to do?” Cece smile. “And you’re my scientist?” Cece shouts. “She was . . . handsome. Funny. He made a joke about mulch. My first mulch joke. Popped my mulch cherry.” Her tone is vaguely dreamy. “Then . . . seems like someone I would want to date, you know?” “I’d want to date?” “Well”—she waves her hand—“not my stuff.

First, I thought that, if I knew her first one, she’s way too beautiful. Her twisted, pointy chin, and bright golden lips might be unconventional, but she looks like the sexiest, most beautiful woman in the universe. Secondly: she’s the body of a woman. She is a woman of nature who pees with the door open and eats Chex Mix as cereal, full of lurid anecdotes about their sex lives doled out with a small, twisted face. I barely let any of this personality fool anyone, but she bombards people. And it did turn out to be a problem: clients like her too much. “What do you tell them when they get married to date ?” she asked me last night. We were splitting a bag of Babybels while watching a movie . It was packed in eight parts. And I wondered if the person who offered me seventy bucks to have sex in his nearby parked car qualified. Probably not. “It’s just not in the way,” said I. “Wait—really?” “Nope.” I shrugged. “No
