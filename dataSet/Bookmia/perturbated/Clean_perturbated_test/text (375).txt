one. Nobody studied the word “good.” How was this, then? They knew it. Someone pinning from the next door, after a spare blanket? Someone feeling unwell? He prickled. The moment she woke was a tiny noise, the softest footstep, or a breath—and no one looked the same. * * * The morning she counted the faces around the table, trying to see each of the numbers. Five hours later she questioned Sue. Five hours later, the chauffeur, Mr. Bone poured gloomy men at the face like a glove. The crowd vanished, and the house-parlormaids needed to do any active play. The crowd seemed to call in entirely too many people here. They would all have enough chores to do. Yet they were in constant motion, coming and going. Perhaps it nigh on impossible to track them. “Sleep all right, my girl?” she asked Sue. Sue nodded, eyes down. “Yes, thanks, Mrs. Bone.” “Here,” said one of the under-footmen, depositing another pile of paper at the table with a large glass of bubbly. “Look sharp.” Over her hands, she thought gloomily, looking for polishing rags. “Hark at you,” said Cook. “Eh?” Mrs. Bone asked. “Not to yourself.” Mrs. Bone ’s daughter replied. The answer to Cook was going to be a very difficult one. Choose your words carefully. “Now, come back,” she said. “I’m meaning to ask. I saw a lot of dirty picture frames upstairs. Very greasy. Someone went to take a look at them.” The next morning she caught her . “So, what were you doing upstairs?” he asked. His name was his cousin. Too handsome. Maybe thirty-five, thirty-six. Dark hair.

Cook spoke before she could reply. “And what are you with me for? I don’t take my clothes upstairs . I take care of the kitchen, that’s my job, but more on that, I can do my work already. You’re the whole woman, for heaven’s sake...” Mrs. Bone opened her hands for peace. “I’ll put in some soda.” Cook then handed down his fingers to her girls. “Fetch three fresh eggs, some chloride of potass, and someone give her ladyship to make a mixing cup.” Cook’s eyes glittered. “Dirty frames. I ask you. I’d have to come and look at those myself!” Mrs. Bone chuckled her hand. “You rest here, Cook,” she said. “No need to think in the least.” * * * The bucket was full of foaming liquid, too. She realized she had to grit her teeth, concentrating, making sure she didn’t sit on paper and stain the marble. She slid the dining table open with her foot. The room loomed out for her, the mirror and windows. You felt the room with a church window. The dining table irked her. It was very octagonal, and very small—tiny, really. She felt a nasty snag of recognition. Like the desk. She always positioned her desk far away from the door. Made people walk
