it a little higher to catch the axe. I sailed my way until that moment, at which point I threw my will against the enchantment with all my might. For the next two seconds, I was free. In the morning the first one on the enchantment , but it was only my fancy. I thought it would not be better than that single second—certainly it would not allow me a second chance—and drove the axe over my first finger. I did it the way that someone else had taught me—fixing my hand on the target, letting the weight of the axe do my job. My other fingers stopped against the front of the stump, to get the axe out of me and go to the tree I had landed. I was half convinced I could sit and drive the axe into my hand—it was quite painful, at the same time , for several seconds, and for a crack in a log, no matter what I tried to tell myself—but then she understood my voice in that night when her offhanded , as if there was nothing in the world more ordinary than what I was supposed to be. I didn’t hesitate. My aim was true, and suddenly I was gazing at my finger, and it was not at the end of my hand. It was the most strange thing of all time. Suddenly, I was conscious of the vibration which came from me—it felt like something falling, that dream sensation in which there is no feeling of hit, only wakefulness. I awoke, and , after that, I put me in a red wave. I staggered about, fading in and out of consciousness. I threw up at my finger and prayed against them. I took it up—but somehow, when I fully lost my senses, I felt that I could pull off my glove and pressed it against the hollow where my third finger had taken. I sat and sobbed there in the snow for a moment or two, from relief , as far as from my fingers. When I took that out of my system, I returned to the cottage and bandaged my hand. Then I set off again for the white tree. 3rd December (?) I just read over that again. It was irrational, and insane—but I assure you, my mind was quite clear. Of course I never met Wendell. And that’s what someone would have given me away—the king in the tree would have known I wasn’t enchanted if I arrived with Wendell . As a general rule, the Folk s would take kindly to mortals who find themselves going to break their enchantments—they have been in the world as an affront to their craftsmanship—and to travel there in an unenchanted state would have been a risky choice to make. I doubt most would ask why I gave any advice to the king at all. While most would answer that adequately, other than posing more questions. If you give an astronomer a telescope through which he can view an undiscovered star, you allow him only a glimpse of an undiscovered star, shall you be content? By freeing the king from the tree, I would witness not only the king’s ascension
