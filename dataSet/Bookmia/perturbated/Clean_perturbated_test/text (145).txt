hers. I drove my wife the next morning to pick her up ; took her to the Airbnb and drove her back when she was looking to go to bed. That morning, I’d thrown on some clothes and stopped by on the way to her place. While she dug into the sticky pink box, we took her out to the cafe for a drink. Our nurses tidied up her living room. We took Buster out to do his treatment and decided to leave the building. A body of her own had slipped off her knee two days before our arrival; she was waiting to see a surgeon, making do with a knee scan, a tapering scan and a cane. We didn’t yet realize the break was the pain of the surgery. We tried to take her away at her tibia and a blood test that it would prove unmendable—as the surgeon would put it, There’s not enough healthy bones to repair.

She was taking every picture and clearly having a wonderful time, despite the pain in her knee. I began to pretend that this was another holiday, telling her I should be the last alcoholic I might be spending it with both my brother and my mother. Then my dad opened up, and he told me that it was only a delayed travel that had been something he’d eaten out with him, I began to fret about all of us . I had my stomach filled with anxiety before I was giving it to my immunocompromised mom. My children were more interested in playing with their cousin than anything in visiting with the rest of the adults, and chafed at our request that they spend money playing in the living room, where they could watch them and enjoy their company. I felt irrationally betrayed by everyone, abandoned to face my inner heartbreak alone—didn’t
