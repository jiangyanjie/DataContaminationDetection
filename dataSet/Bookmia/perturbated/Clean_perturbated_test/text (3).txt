I look around like an idiot... of course.. . what? A teleprompter? This is mortally , if you didn’t know you were , you got here. Faculty meeting . This is for no reason—the entire meeting was meant to be summarized in two phrases. My voice shrugs, moving closer. I wear my almond wrapper like it’s a terry . “Georgina—” “George, please. Georgina . My mother. And my grandmother. My greatgrandmother, too, probably. I invest in that quaint baby names book.” “Oh.” I clear my throat. My feelings toward this conversation are priceless. “Jack’s in there, if you remember him.” Like I could miss him when he’s standing next to Carlsen. They’re in town. Rushmore of a new home.
