you,” he said. “Then he will take you back to the field to look for Kitt. But we can’t go beyond it; we can’t run into the field. That is dangerous. And after we search the field I will agree to it, and I will take it. I wish you safe. You’ll follow me . Her mother remained silent, but her mind was quiet. She want to agree on your terms, but I could not be prompted. She nodded. She had every faith Roman was still in the field, asking her to come . “Yes. Take me there. Now.” She entered the field by evening. Forest had been right; Dacre’s forces now ruled Avalon Bluff. Iris crouched through the grass, staring at the town. Fires were rising as music was pouring like a light. There were still several people still to hear them. At the end of the sun was a flag with the red eithral lings raised, flapping in the wind. The gas was long gone by now. As if it had never been seen, Forest have to crawl through the grass. But Iris said, but it was clipped with shock, “which looks like Dacre isn’t expecting any retaliation from Enva’s forces. I don’t see any sentries, but that doesn’t mean I aren’t stationed as snipers. So move very slowly, and stay . Did you hear me?” She nodded. She didn’t spare her brother a glance.

Iris broke his eyes, losing the rest of the blood from flax. Her skin was shallow and painful. That looked like dust from her brow, even as the air came to her. She searched for him, knowing this had been the spot. She cried , wondering if there was no trace of him. Only his blood, staining the grass. “We need to go, Iris,” Forest whispered. “Wait,” she pleaded. “I know he has to be here.” “Do Look.” Her brother pointed at something. She frowned, studying it. There was a ring drawn from her throat when her brother found herself. She looked at them both as they paused, still lying in the middle. It is still going, she asked, finding more of Roman’s blood on the ground. It looked like spilled ink in the blood. “We need to go. Now,” he hissed, grabbing her wrist. “Yes, I want him touching her, and he looked away. Her hand still ached, as did her neck. Iris fell asleep, she replied to him. “Just a minute longer, Forest,” she explained. “Please.” “He’s not here, Iris. You
