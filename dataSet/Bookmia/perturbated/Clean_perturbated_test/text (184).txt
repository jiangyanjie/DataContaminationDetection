have been. I love him.” “And what kind of life would that have been? For me and Miss Baker, I am proud of him. I couldn’t hold him, cry, feed him. She couldn’t talk to him, play with him or do anything for him.” “You would have figured out where my baby was going .” Lenora says. “I was seventeen. I knew I was taking care of my baby.” “That’s still no reason to keep your sister ’s child apart!” Anger churns in my chest, crashing inside me like the waves smashing against the water below us. “How could you be so cruel?” “Cruel?” Lenora says. “It’s quite the opposite, I assure you. Keeping that child away from this family was no act of morality to both me and Miss Baker, that child grew up never knowing that his real mother is a murderer.” “She must even have been punishing him for the sake of that fact.” “She didn’t go to his brother” Lenora says. After what she did, that child was paid for in whatever time she needed to be . And it was true for her, too. I always thought about what happened to a woman in her condition if the parent was “just what she’d done.” I shake my head and chant that’s not a good enough reason. Especially when, other than trying to say that, she had nothing to suggest to his parents. “Why are you so certain she did it? What about Ricardo Mayhew?” “What about her boyfriend?

Yet Lenora keeps laughing, a low chuckle that’s more disbelieving than amused. “That’s impossible,” she says. I hear footsteps on the service stairs. A second line emerges into the kitchen. He has no idea how long he’s been there or how much he’s been there. But all I know is it was easy for him to answer questions. “Because you take it with you in your way,” Archie says. He takes me a second to understand what he’s getting at. When I do, all I can say is, “Oh. The two of you were—” “Lovers,” Archie says, preventing me from having to walk away from being there. Every couple of seconds, I think of a few questions. Archie does not give me time to ask a single one. “I was as surprised as you are ,” Archie says. “For one, he didn’t even know what I was in those days and in my limited experience, that was usually the case. I like today, which allows me more freedom. Back then, there had to be something to do. If you didn’t have someone right, I was barely eighteen. One wrong , my whole life could have been ruined.” Archie tells me how much Ricardo has to hold a secret, sneaking me inside for whatever they could. It wasn’t easy. Ricardo shared the cottage with his wife. Archie lived in one of the rooms over the garage, which is where they met. “We called
