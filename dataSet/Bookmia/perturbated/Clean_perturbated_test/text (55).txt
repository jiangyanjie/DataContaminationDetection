have a word with my friends in private.” “You have one minute,” Bernard said. “I can’t give you any longer. Don’t make me happy.” He stepped toward the corner. The Coachman sat next to Vic with his arms resting on him. Bernard walked up at him and gripped his head when digging the door. The foot was almost grounding, and he wondered whether he should feel as if he did. “My love.” the Coachman said in his voice. “Thank you.” “For what?” “Showing me the whole room, and waiting , and waiting, as I once thought.” He stood and squeezed Vic’s hand. He couldn’t even speak past the burning crates near his throat. He nodded, squeezing his hand . “I wish you well on your adventure,” the Coachman said as he pulled it away. “I hope you find what you are looking for.” “Coachman,” the Coachman said. “Soog,” he stood . He found his full urgency in his hands. “It’s time.” The Coachman looked down at them. “It is.” He stood, and with a twitch of his mustache, stepped away out of sight. Bernard jumped to them. He stepped off and popped the lid over them. Before he shut it completely, he spoke. “There’s a button. To your right. Can you do this?” “Yes.” “You can’t open the crate.

He had heard his eyes, and breathed in through his nose and eyes toward his mouth. Hap was a warm presence behind him, standing in the middle of Vic’s sides, fingers brushing against the metal of his vest. It was small. The crate was small. The crate was small, and was trapped inside. Vic turned his eyes for the button that Bernard clocked. He found himself in the corner above their feet. All he had to do is kick it, and the box would open. It would open, and they could be free. They could stand. They could breathe, because the crate was growing . He gripped the cage, as he struggled for the box. He ran up and left the back of his throat, breathing the same way he said it would get hot. And Hap whispered, “Tell m-me.” “Tell you what?” Vic gasped, shifting against the side of his neck. He was stepping back towards the slide of metal and skin and the opening of his back. His helmet mounted his lid overhead. His thoughts were clouded, like a
