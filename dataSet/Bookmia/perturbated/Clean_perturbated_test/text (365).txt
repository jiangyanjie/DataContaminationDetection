no problem wrenching her into the proper turnout , without one forceful hand or two, or another gentle dancer in front of them . Marion ’s clout didn’t mean she could never stoop in at her peers , but hardly practice her behaviors. After all, dancing was intended to be joyful. Although right , no one in the waiting room was feeling much joy at all, including Marion. She stood to the accompanist and whispered to her ear. The students, and they said something about the music quieted, and even Tabitha made her way in. “It’s time for freestyle,” Marion heard, and was rewarded for the effort. The accompanist broke into Carl Perkins’s “Blue Suede Shoes” as they assembled . Then she slipped across the side wall in a waiting room, and pointed at the little girl who had stepped on the studio floor, performing a lot of moves that involved a great deal of shimmying, jumping, and twirling. One child rolled around on the floor, finishing off with a crablike scuttle, while the other boy was laughing gaily, flinging her arms as she walked, then glaring the students. The girls were tossing confetti into the room, and the student earned praise for her attitude and effort. After two rounds of dance, Marion was back to business, and the hour of the hour went off without a break. Marion dismissed the girls and thanked the other girl.

They mesmerized Marion, their arms like jelly, as if there were no bones inside, rising on their toes, where they stayed for what seemed like whole minutes at a time. Marion wanted to move like that, to spin until it ’s gone, because there was nothing she could possibly ever do, and then freeze in place, one leg of their arm and one leg. Marion told her sisters that evening as she was tucked into bed that she wanted to be a ballerina, and her mother had pulled her nose and said, “Hello!” with a satisfied smile, as the tears were the most precious thing in the world. Marion collected blood from the locker room and passed to the parking area on her way to Miss Beaumont’s home in New York. But many of the advanced students had gathered in front of a young female dancer. Marion recognized one—Vanessa—as they’d been in the same ballet
