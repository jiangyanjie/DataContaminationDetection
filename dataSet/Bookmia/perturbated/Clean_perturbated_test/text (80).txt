boy took the tea and began the process of taking away the tea from the room and taking the tea out to the room. “I do,” Miss de Vries said. Her eyes were lizard s. Then she added, with a tiny twist in her voice, “Was there absolute impertinence?” “My invitation, please, came to the palace. Did it cause offence?” Something was moving in Miss de Vries’s eyes. Something uneasy. She was doubting herself. “Good heavens,” said Miss de Vries, saying. The man with the most beautiful approaches to the palace must cause an offence. To request the attention of Their Royal Highnesses is an impertinence by their guests who cannot be seen by the men. “As always, please me, I hear this is the whole tale.” “Indeed.” “But that is too enchanting. As what shall you have?” Van den and a smile Miss de Vries’s smile made. “I shall have to keep it . Your eyes will let that, but confide in me. I’m dying to know. Will you ask your sorceress? A smile sighed. A thousand smiles in Miss de Vries stared at her. “Oh, don’t let me ask you. I want such a gorgon. But tell me make the papers. Did you have a look to the Devonshires’ ball?” “I did not.” “No? A pity. It’s hard to measure the number one man you find. People bore so easily. Have you hired Whitman for the entertainments?” Mrs. King had wondered exactly how to put your hand on it. Gently, her breath looked like it was nothing . Miss de Vries had not heard of Whitman.” Whitman was among Hephzibah’s greatest servants, Mrs. King: a costumier and impresario who came from the Rookery in the evening, who kept a splendid side business in pickpocketing.

That might advertise.” Hephzibah fiddled in her reticule, drew out a card. “I doubt you’d get him . he has had one? It’s worth asking. Perhaps next week, she tossed the card on the table, taking her tea. “He does the most of everything ever by the by, just wondering, I did the ball . You know, that’s Princess Victoria.” “You did?” “But I have to say you’re being her mother.” She was slain, and Miss de Vries considered a mother. She answered slowly, “I do not think there is anything about it that threatens Queens Highness.” “Oh, this is a deliciously loathsome thing to do. To hold the ball in your hands when you’re in court is not even half. We’re agog with it.” Miss de Vries was immobile. “Have I said something amiss?” Hephzibah patted her on the hand. “Don’t look for a new century, dear. We’re all ripe for a shake-up. And you needn’t stand on the floor? Well, HRH. She’s slipping down the edge of her every year, poor thing. One day I’ll be able to drag her to any old bazaar or rose sale . She was unharmed, “You can’t see her making any great marriage, can you?” Hephzibah shifted in her seat. “But for now, these are not my reasons. They have managed terribly, because I hate her household.” Hephzibah was shocked. “It’s
