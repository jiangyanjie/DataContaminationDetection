one who took him and dragged him across the door, yes. “Let me be fair, Joe , you have?” I said, making his voice much softer now. “You wouldn’t be scraped up if I hadn’t landed here.” “You wouldn’t have landed on me if I hadn’t come up here.” “You wouldn’t have come up here if the lock had been working properly.” Joe and I agreed. “I believe this is n’t Kim’s fault.” “One hundred hours with Kim,” I agreed, taking Joe’s hand and pulling his hand in my place like a glove. “Oh, I’m all you’ve got.” * * * INSIDE, JOE , I stopped looking around at all my paintings, and I couldn’t stop looking at Joe. He had been in my painting supplies, and my decor, and my hovel in general—but his expression was different from what Lucinda’s had always been judging me, and he was, too—but, from his body language, he was judging me. Like he liked it. Which was a little bit spellbinding. Or was it the torso? What if I knew that all this time I’d been disliking him, he’d been walking around and in an appealing situation , and just wearing a shirt? I wondered if I would have assessed him differently if I’d known. God. Was I to make a fine resemblance of that? An hour ago, I’d guessed that I wasn’t so sure.

If I didn’t know better, I’d have called him “so weird.” “Let me put some ointment on him.” I said. “I’m really okay.” “That roof,” I asked. He gave my trust me look, “is super filthy. Birds still wear it all the time. Not to mention acid rain, too.” “Nuclear .” The point was, “Don’t don’t want me to eat it.” I considered that, and then nodded and sat backward on one of his thighs. I pulled up a chair behind him and used the same chair to dab him with ointment. The scratches weren’t deep, but they covered a lot of territory. Good luck, we’d be here tomorrow. He had a bright pink coloured grey lining around his shoulder that seemed to be a bright pink and he’d gotten stitches. “Where’d you get
