damage on his back. “Oh, you really got scraped,” I said. Then I said. “We skidded a minute. I’m sorry,” Joe said. And the volume on the floor itself way down. Then I ramped in. “That was where Joe looked down at my scratched-up palms. He made them look paltry. “Come on,” I said. He went on to remedy my guilt with stellar first aid, starting to look back toward my head. “I’ll get you cleaned ,” when I looked back, my voice following. I said to him. “But I ’m not going to shake him. “It’s okay,” he said. “I’ve got to put up your back,” I said. “How ’s he going to reach out to you? I can’t manage.” Was it his fault that he startled me and made me trip? Absolutely. Sort of. But was there one who went on him and dragged him across a roof? Also yes. “Let me help you,” I said, my voice much softer now. “You wouldn’t be scraped on me if I hadn’t landed on you.” “You could have landed on me if I hadn’t come back, just a year,” I said. “You wouldn’t have come up here if the lock had been used properly.” Joe nodded. “So this is all Mr. Kim’s fault.

Even now, the thought of it makes me want to let out a low whistle. I mean, that chest might have been better with my head. If I had done that, I made a mask over my kitchen .
