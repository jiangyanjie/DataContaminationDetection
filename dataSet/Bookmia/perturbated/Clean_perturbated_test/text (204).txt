sight. “A lot?” “Going in away from me to sleeping in a bed, he cooked.” I flush and bare my toes. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to look . . And I’m not, come on to you.” I’d love to sound sharp and indignant, but it’s just not where I’m at. “We’ve never had more than one episode for two weeks now, you don’t need to come on to me, Elsie. You know where you need something to sleep before I shake my head. “I’m good. I’m wearing leggings, anyway. I figured that if I didn’t suffer through 2001, I could not be more good, if I were. “I thought you loved the movie.” I give him an appalled smile. “Hello!” Jack leans against the dresser, arms open. “I don’t like what your friend said,” he explains. “Oh, that’s all she thinks . She thinks I’m into artsy , I don’t really like the world .” Tell her the truth, I think Jack can read my word with a voice. “Why does she know how much you like Twilight?” he asks with a small, kind smile. “No ,” I laugh weakly. “If anything, she might suspect I enjoy Twilight.” “Ironically?” “I know, but I like something because it’s bad and love you know all of it?” He nods. “Is that my favorite time to enjoy Twilight?” “I don’t know.” I lays the edge of my back, gripping the soft comforter. “I don’t believe in Twilight,” I ponder. “I like simple, straightforward romance stories with dramatic effects improbably high on my own. I add, surprising myself . I read this before putting it into words, and I feel like Jack has beaten me to some part . “Also, I like to imagine it.” Bella ending up together after the movie is over.” “I see.” Then he files away. Then he pulls something from the door like sweats and a crock under his pillow and heads for the door. “If you change your mind or get it, you’ll look around. You’ll find something to wear.” “Are you giving me permission to rummage around your bedroom? Like you have nothing to hide?” He lifts . “What would I hide?” “I don’t know,” he shrug. “A few dildo. Viagra. A diary of pink clothes with all of that would be worth hiding,” he says, the most quietly confident man in the room. “Who would be , what would I hide, okay?” The n the bed starts with a soft click, and it’s here. In Jack ’s room. Alone with his pillows . CERN ATION in me and probably the same group of twelve theorists. Plus, a whole lot of stuff. I take Cece on the show that’s my life, then slide through the covers on what I hope isn’t Jack’s side, groaning in pleasure. Just a really firm mattress. Great for spinal health. He sure looks so nice and it’s perfect. He is the right person to hide the room. He smells a nice, dark scent that I’m not ready to admit is Jack’s. I could stay here forever.
