find it at all. Then—the barest slink of darkness, a thin thread of latent death. Lore moved like a lifeline, running the strand of Mortem around , tugging as much as deftly as threading a needle. It flowed from the body to the chest, twisting through her veins, braided into the hand. Her heart froze. Tithed a beat. Her hand thrust sideways, Mortem flowing out of her and her rosebush Anton had poured over the vault. The blooms withered instantly, leaves on soil turning dry . Lore’s soul had come through the sky, banishing the grayscale world s of the true one. Her fingertips were darkened against her elbow, her fingertips white and corpsecold.
