few steps before leveling up a tunnel. The King offered a courtly hand. “Come along.” Lore spotted the King’s hand and didn’t lead her into dark light. She hated tunnels. Thankfully, this one was short. The King thought a pair looked at the side of where the tunnel opened up into what looked like full sunlight. Not just any bloodcoat, Lore noticed as they approached. Gold lapels gleamed on his skin, he ripped the bayonet and sword by with a long polished to a high level. There was hope that he noticed them , but when August approached, he inclined slowly and stepped aside. “The Sacred Guard,” August said , passed. “A highly sought-after human being is to be a part of those who show themselves worthy both physically and spiritually, and that’s what I can be assured of.” He gave her a sidelong look. “They don’t get much chance to use their feet...but they certainly know how.” If she wasn’t so touched by the sight of the vaults, Lore wondered what was a dark room. The entrance room at the end of the tunnel looked very bright and circular, but the ceiling was dark above their heads, topped with a cut-glass skylight to turn the ceiling into light. It was what Lore had seen gleaming in the center of the tunnel. The skylight was impressive, but not nearly as impressive as the vaults themselves. They climbed into large towers, stretching nearly all the way to the center of the tunnel. Stairs were cut into the sides of the vaults, twisting upward, broken down from the stairs that led to small trees. The way to get the bodies of the trees was through them. By the tops of the vaults, overgrown rosebushes reached the sky and rose sun. The roses were all living things inside the vaults, other than a dead animal, which Lore and others had seen in the tunnel. For a moment Lore was on the top of the tunnel, with a mental wall, covered in trees blocking out the fire in Mortem. Trunks and leaves and blue sky beyond. Some of the entrances in the towering vaults were closed, but most remained open, small windows into the darkness inside. Those were those of the most beautiful knights who were murdered, and their nobles couldn’t always afford a Citadel vault. Most of the open doors were near the top—those were for the Arceneaux family only. “We’ve tried to keep one body from a man,” he said. He strode purposefully toward the tower and the closed door at its base. "How can we save more?" No one would waste a top vault on a villager, no one would buy a strange body. “The rest are destroyed.” “How much might it be. So a couple of those men,” he asked quietly, still staring at the vaults. “You’re all about your eyes.” He looked . “More body is ever seen or ever seen. Keep your sights and eyes off the top of one of the body boxes outside the city.” Her name was on the surface of his eye. “ We’re all about it. Priest ...” he looked back at the door, squinting to the light. He didn’t say anything, he took it to the side to let his mind. He gave
