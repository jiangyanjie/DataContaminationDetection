over my shoulder. “It says summer camp. It’s gotta be what Javier’s grandma was talking about, but I do guess what the hell should be the truth after all.” “The n he’s not that old, but it makes anything about campers being killed.” He picks all the papers down. “Why did Mr. Lamont have this place? Why did he buy this place?” Bezi asks. “Maybe he just hasn’t used all this junk.” “Why would he tell me it’s expensive supplies and not to waste my money?” I ask. “He’s trying to hide the stash here? Why? It makes no sense.” I dig through more scraps than I can find anything else . Once I get to summer camp, I do find something about the purchase of the land itself under a small pile of silverfish. I shake off the tan envelope, while the other bits which are still squirming, to find attached to the paper a photocopy of a deed. I smooth it out. The center is an approximation of Mirror Lake. South of the station is a highlighted area labeled proposed site of summer camp, but the lines and measurements indicating the perimeters of the camp extend far beyond the fenced area. “I wish Porter could get over these” I say. “He could explain what this all means.

I stare at the blank screen. “Why?” she asks. “Not sure,” I say. All the other monitors are black and have designated to be black . “The cameras are pretty new, so I’ve gotta check it before we shut everything down so Mr. Lamont knows to fix it before it is shut down. If there even is a next season.” Bezi has her arm under her nose, but pulls me toward the door. “It’ll be good now,” Bezi says reassuringly. I lean against her shoulder, wanting so I can believe her when suddenly, by a split second, the camera blinks on me, “I see a figure, cloaked in the tunnel under the hatch that leads up through the apron” and the screen goes dark. 9 The camera blinks on me and the screen goes dark. “Did you love that?” I ask. Bezi glances back at me. “What?” “I saw someone in the tunnel under the boathouse hatch.” I say. Bezi asks. “Kyle or Javier?” I tell.” The lighting down there is low on me, so I don’t
