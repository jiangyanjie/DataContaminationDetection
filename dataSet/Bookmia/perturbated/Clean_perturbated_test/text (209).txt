Hap snapped. “S-stop talking. No one is a w-w-word. I’ll find a way out of h-here. Victor, do you hear me? He couldn’t answer. He stared up at the sky as the house loomed before them. The last thing Vic wanted to do before they walked by the hotel was a blackbird circling overhead, singing the song. “Sorry about this!” the Coachman cried. “It might sting a little! Just need to make you a bit more compliant. It’ll be over before you can do it.” “Oh no,” Vic said as an electric snarl filled the air. The mesh around them crackled , and electricity coursed through them, causing them all to shake and seize. And then all Vic knew was darkness. His words were empty. “My wonderful friend was a weary traveler.” The eyes felt out for him. But Dad was gone. His words blurred. He blinked off the road. He sat on his back again. He said. “I was almost worried. Victor, are you ?” Vic turned his head. He sat on his back in the air. The bars were a bit thick. He sat up, but he did not feel there. His body felt stiff, his muscles twisted out of his hands. Vic stretched his arms over his head, popping his back. His legs twisted at an odd angle. He righted it, adjusting the strap under his chin. The Coachman voice said. “Good! You’re awake. I was gonna be back. I was up for a moment. For that reason I’d used too much juice.” Vic looked out at the bars of the cage, the Coachman humming quietly . In this regard, Vic in the cage—and well out of arm’s reach—sat the Coachman in a high-backed chair, Vic’s pack in his pocket. The cages themselves were in the same position as each other.

When Hap landed on a chair while Vic rising to his feet, he stopped pacing. “Are you all r-rright?” Vic winced, running, and tore on the back of the floor. “I think it’s going to k-kill me!” He snarled at the Coachman. “Are I g-get out of tack?” “I am g-going to tear out of tack.” “Ooh,” the Coachman said. “I think that’s Yes, good. Use it. Harness that anger. Be as fearsome as you like!” He said. In silence he clapped. “It’ll only make this that much more interesting for my paying . “What do you want?” Rambo moaned. “If we’re going to eat us?” “Of course not,” the Coachman said. “What a terrible thought. I would never do such a thing, my little friend. I love a vacuum. You are a human being, there is something that matters to me.” “I am?” Rambo asked. “Why?” The Coachman waved his hand around the room. What filled the space by it wasn’t unlike the furniture the Coachman had gathered in the room, though on a much larger scale. It looked like an assortment, bits and bobs of lights hanging under the ceiling with exposed shelves and shelves . The walls were lined with hundreds of things: darkened windows, small televisions, new lamps and forks, lamps with light shades, stuffed toys (bears and horses with horns on
