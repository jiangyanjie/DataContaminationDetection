City of Electric Dreams . Who do they belong to humans?” Nurse Ratched asked. Her screen ran with lines of code that had the quicker lines he could follow. “It did, and it was one of the reasons I fall. The City was turned over over to the City of Machines, the point where the machines are connected via a neural network. Think of it as a directional mind of sorts, put in place by the Authority.” “Who are they?” Rambo se Coachman hesitated. “I don’t know if there’s any one specific answer . It seemed as if a particular machine had a throne and was there . We can see it as a collective: a group of programs , where it had the power. Our purpose was to create the machine in a very simple way, a path for all to follow.” “It sounds like a problem,” Nurse Ratched said. The Coachman’s eyebrows rose. “I actually thought about it , but yes, I suppose that’s correct. As a society, because of a deity, we were the larger good. The Greater Good was another concept, one that allowed us to become the stewards of this world like religion, it led us to believe that we should have been the greater good of ourselves. All our decisions were made not because of a desire for power, but to preserve it, taking the Vic’s voice hard. The Coachman winced. “Yes, that’s right. The Authority found free will to be human in the future.

But instead of becoming humans, they came to us, they remained, working in front of those who had to think for themselves.” “L-like you,” Hap said. “Like me,” Hap agreed. “What I can’t figure out,” Gio said. By raising a little reveal to God over the Coachman’s shoulders, “is that Gio had lived in the city for a really long time. Why would they come for him now?” “I don’t know,” Gio said. “But it can’t be for anything like his way, but my fingers paused on the same level. “I know I don’t need to tell you this, but Giovanni is ... special. As far as I know, there ’s been a machine in the area before Giovanni is able to escape. After his escape, the city went to work for months as the Authority looked for him. “I’ve never seen anything like it.” He resumed typing. “If Giovanni is as important as I think , he’ll be taken here. It’s where his acquittal started, and it’s where he’d have been returned.” A tower appeared on the monitor. Made of black and black stone and glass, the tower sprayed into the sky, the top hidden by the moon. The side of the tower was the symbol of the
