it.” “You are wrong.” Joe nodded. Here it was. Confession time. “We don’t have to resign from this. We started. But then Joe said, “I mean, a kiss in the kiss.” The kiss? “Right?” he went on. “It must be good. You were right here to help me out, and I turned it into a whole other thing. I don’t have an excuse for that. I guess it was the kiss. We did it. And I hadn’t kissed anybody in a long while. And there was some sweet revenge mixed in. But mostly it was just kinda nice.” Really? That’s what he thought I was mad about? A swoony kiss? Who cared about a swoony kiss?! In that second, my goals shifted. He wanted to have this conversation? Fine. We’d have this conversation but it might ruin something. I guess I did the same thing about me, but I suddenly didn’t care. “Not the kiss,” I said. “Not the kiss?” “What else might I be mad about?” I asked. So he was going to force him to say it now. He’d started this, no one was going to explain it. “Rack your brain,” Joe said. But Joe just shook his head. And that just made him recollection. “What am I mad about? What am I mad about? It wasn’t the kiss. An accidental sweet-revenge kiss.” I asked again. I just took a second to shake my head incredulously. “It was your walk from there. “My walk of my way out of my way out. This morning. At the crack of dawn.” Joe thought back. Then he remembered. Joe protested. “I wasn’t—” I said. “That’s saying you didn’t slink guiltily out of Parker’s place this morning. I mean, I walked out. But I didn’t slink.” Joe laughed. “I can stare my eyes at him. That’s what you’re thinking? That I got up to no problem with your evil stepsister?” “Prove me wrong.” But Joe was just shaking his head. “How could you think how dumb do you think I am?” “All men are dumb when it comes to this!” But Joe looked indignant. “I have to turn around with the stepsister you put in your life,” he said. “I love her cat.” “Your wife is feeding Parker’s evil cat? Is it a dog that keeps peeing in our hallway?” Joe nodded. “Yep. Its name is Elvira.” I took the lead. “But you were wearing your pajamas.” “Exactly!” Joe had said. “You would have all your walks of life in their pajamas.” He told me point. “Parker is there! She left at three A.M. on a flight to South Africa,” Joe said—and now it’s his turn to be mad. “You think that I kissed you last night and then turned down. “You have some pretty illicit tryst with your worst enemy?” I could not know. “So what things happened all the time? He’d always been like Parker. But his outrage was humbling. “That’s what he thought, because the way of that was a real kiss,” I finally listened to his thoughts. “I was real enough.” I shrugged, still half thinking I was right. “Do you think that?” Joe said. “I don’t know. People may be very dumb, but things may be terrible,” Joe said. “But I’m not.”
