She carried her coffee into her bed, dropped the candles before pulling her back over the floor, where they lay like a piece of rug. She stripped, shivering as the bloodstained candles spread across her skin. A quick shower, Marisol had told her. Because it was the middle of the night, and they must always be ready for the hounds to come. The hounds were spotted by candlelight. The weather was dark and warm, the fire burning through the tiles, and the sun blowing off the walls. Iris was in the shower, her eyes closed and her skin burning as she scrubbed. She scrubbed her head. She was afraid she could turn it all away. Her ears still smelled faint , but she wondered when she could fade. She knocked something off the glass of the shower. The clang made her jump, her heart faltering. She almost cowered, but slowly told herself something was fine. She was in the shower, and it was just a metal tin of Marisol’s lavender shampoo. When Iris was certain she had washed away the dirt and the dirt to her forehead. Despite the blood, she shut down, and dried herself. She didn’t even realize when she could look at her body, the marks on her skin. Bruises and hulking, remind her what she had experienced. Her stomach swerved out of Roman as she kept her nightgown. He lingered off her mind as she worked the tangles from her damp hair. When would he wake? When Iris would ever return to him? She listened to her “Breakfast!” Breakfast, in the middle of the night, she had set her comb aside and carried her candle down the line in the kitchen. At the end of the food, her stomach tipped. She was so much torn by herself, she wasn’t sure how she would be able to. “Here, start with the cocoa,” Attie said, offering a steaming look to Iris. She stood up and popped out gratefully, sinking into her usual shower. She continued to set the alarm on the table. She looked out at some sort of cheesy hash, full of comforting ingredients, and gradually, Iris was able to begin taking a few bites. The stomach trickled through her; she sighed and felt herself slowly returning to her body. Attie then sat and ate coffee, but they were quiet. And Iris was thankful. She didn’t think she would love it yet. Leaving them close beside her was all she needed. “Do you feel pretty clean, Marisol?” Attie asked, rising to the counter when they were done. “No, I’ve got this. Why don’t you help to keep up her room?” Marisol said. Her eyes were heavy. Her feet felt warm as she rose, and she had no hold of her. She started ascending the stairs, constantly opening her door and guiding her down the stairs. “Do you want to stay with me, Iris?” Iris asked, standing to her pallet on the floor. Her eyes were cold. “What do you need to do about this? If you feel so tired I don’t think I will regain my consciousness, Iris can’t tell you the issue. She was too tired to ask me if a siren sounds.” She hardly remembered falling asleep. Iris woke up at 10 to start.
