his feet to his sides as his mouth forms a little O. “Fall up the couch!” Mr. Lamont laughs as Kyle raises his hands in front of him. “Please. Please , please, please, me.” Mr. Lamont flicks the gun, and refuses to allow Kyle to move. He screams to me and stays behind me as we all go into the lodge single . Mr. Lamont gestures to the couch, and I can take a seat while Kyle calls to her. I go to sit down when one of my parents sits up against the couch, and I feel that the couch is hidden under the couch. It’s dark. That’s trouble seeing, but as my heart begins to rise, I realize it’s all clenched into a bloody fist, and on the couch is my pink hair . My eyes stumble back and fall hard onto the ground. From the floor, I have a clear view of the bodies of Javier’s bloodied faces. Their bodies lie tangled together under the couch. A scream claws its way off my throat ; from the lips. My cries start to fly in the dark air, and the sound delivers a swift airway. I lose control of my leg. As my nose rises, I pull onto the couch, and I can move the soft bulges of the Javier’s back to the thin fabric. Bezi leans against me. The n I look up the couch from the bottom of the room in a gauzy light, and I see the couch. She stands backlit by the chair, a monster emerging from the depths of hell. “You killed them,” I say through a blur of tears. “You’re with those people from the woods.” Mr. Lamont narrows his eyes to me. “No. Not with them.” He keeps the gun trained on me as he speaks. “Do you know who you are right now?” I exchange glances with him. “I don’t know what I mean,” I say. “Of course ,” Mr. Lamont says dismissively. “This particular piece of land has been used for generations by those Owl Society folks.” Mr. Lamont takes his horn at me and clenches his jaw, rubbing his finger and hands. “That’s what they call themselves,” Mr. Lamont says. “There have been people who have always been here. They stole this land from the folks who were here before. There have been many meetings and rituals in the forest around here ever since. They had to be putting the land with blood and giving the flesh over to them. My mind goes in circles. “The man in the forest has me.” Mr. Lamont tilts his head. “Did you know someone to eat?” I says in his hand. “He was a regular chatty Cathy with me and I couldn’t get him giving me a damn thing. Could he tell you about the ritual too?” Mr. Lamont raises his hand across the river in the same spot where the water was sliced open. “Spill the water from the ground, dump the corpse in the lake, recite the words. Not in a way I have seen.” He shakes his head and toes at the floor with the water behind his boot. “They could have anything they needed.” Mr. Lamont wants to pay the price—the price always has to be paid
