That’s N-o-e—” “Nome?” The sound that comes from my mouth can only be compared to a pterodactyl screech. I leap out of my chair, its legs squealing around the air. There she is, the last person on the signing line, grinning back at me. “That was the place where I made it!” I knock on a stack of Finnegan Walsh headshots in my attempt to catch the next lady, unable to get caught in the sky. No shock, she ’s soft, even after a six-hour flight, dark hair in a low ponytail and not a single crease in her linen pants. “Thank you, thank you, thank you.
