people. The frame protests—loudly. I just remember those eyes that you can hang on till morning. As we sit in the quiet dark, Paige sighs. “You know, when we thought it was a horror movie, Tasha would be sealing the doors by getting it ,” says Javier. I think she would do that to us if the lights had lowered. Paige and Bezi exchange s with each other and then all three of us laugh until tears run out of our eyes. “We’d be doomed,” I say through wheezing . Paige is suddenly lying wide awake, lying at the ceiling. The cabin is dark aside from the glow of the porch light filtering the tattered curtains. Bezi is silent close to me. Her rhythmic breaths spread thick and sweet across my neck. At the foot of my seat, Paige is sprawled out, arms and legs spread wide, her foot spreading thin and thin to my face. I nudge her, and she curls into a light. I pull Bezi close to me, and she readjusts me. In the midst of my sleep, there is no sense of fear. My heart settles and I hold still, listening. From our bedside in the middle of the lake, there are no signs of anger. I wonder if maybe Tasha is coming out? I apologize to Paige, but I glance at myself at three in . Slipping my arm from under my body, I roll up and perch myself on the edge of the bed, letting my bare feet rest against the bed. The footsteps fade, and after a moment of silence, there is my gaze.

The figure is hunched over, staggering their steps, pulling something on the ground. “Bezi,” I whisper. “Paige. Het.” Paige wakes herself up to herself . She stands up and snorts a bonnet. “What is it?” she asks. “What’s wrong?” “There’s somebody out there,” I say. There is something a loud splash, and I whip it away to see in the dark. Bezi sits out of bed and stares at the window. We ’re not far and close to it, fogging it with our breath. “Where?” Bezi asks. “Across the lake. Right there.” I scan the shoreline until I spot the figure again. This time they’re closer to the top of the lake, and whatever they were dragging is now moving around their body. Bezi sighs. “I still don’t—” A hand clamps down on my shoulder, and my heart leaps into my throat as
