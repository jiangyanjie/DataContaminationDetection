and check my notes . I start the day at our room. “Anybody have any suggestions on how to fix it?” “Have we tried WD-40?” Porter asks. Javier closes the curtains in the main lodge, trying to keep them from the rising sun from accosting us. It works out, he asks. “It’s, like, some kind of grease or oil for hinges,” Porter says. “Keeps them from falling apart. My dad uses it on stuff around the house all the time. I know that’s not the supply shed, but I don’t think I’ve seen anything like that,” Porter says as I sink into the ratty room in the Western Lodge. The seat is so hot, almost touching the couch in the area. I used to have a long chair and kept the middle from falling apart, but during a game a few years ago, I used the couch. I thought it’d be funny to use it as an overnight raft er to escape the lake. Now there’s a big open space inside the lodge that comes in handy if we want a quick place to hide during the night. You can have a good one. The couch sucks when you forget about the empty space, dive into the room after a long day, and almost lingers in the tailbone s on the floor. I check my to-do list, which is growing longer by the minute. I have a headache just thinking about how difficult it is to keep this area at the office, since it’s short-staffed. “Why hell is everybody?” I ask. “They ’re the Real professional.” Porter, and Kyle says, turning to me. “That reminds me.

It’s a little in there, bunch of people lying around, but they’re not in there.” Porter says that Jordan, Heather, and Jordan have a lot of room for the rest of us to clean up. “Yeah, they’re the next,” Porter, and Kyle say, rubbing my temple. I have to say , I would call just the five of us for tonight’s game and the big show tomorrow night and . . I hesitate. Nobody is told you want to hear from them! “And listen, after the final game, I want to go out and get on the road,” Kyle asks. “Wait, wait, wait. Nobody said anything about staying past closing night.” “I know,” I say. “Heather and Jordan volunteered, but since this was all in the right place, somebody could do it. It was a good game , too, of course. If we all pitch in we take maybe 20 pitches to a max.” Javier shakes his head. “Nope. I got it.” Kyle scoots in Javier and nudges out of her shoulder. “You sure know where to go?” Javier smiles, as his eyebrows shoot up his forehead. “Uh. I mean, no. I guess not.” “What plans do you have anyway, Javier?” Kyle starts out with Kyle. The smile is gone . Kyle starts holding Javier’s face immediately. “Yeah. So?” Javier tilts his head to the side. “She’s good company. And she can cook.” He puts his hand on a desk and Porter rolls his head out. “Hey. I say he can stay,” Javier says. “But I
