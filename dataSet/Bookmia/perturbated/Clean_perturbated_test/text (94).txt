* * . Back in the day, Victor’s was the theatre, all red velvet on a high -level stand for satyrs chasing nymphs around a lake of wine. When Victor bought it she kept it there, but retrofitted a series of platforms into the seating, so that the whole place starts in the gods and falls down an elevator to the seating. What used to be the director’s box is now a dais with a Last Supper bar covered with a tahini of actual obsidian marble. Stairway, blocked by a single velvet rope, anyone of particular talent and desirability may be offered the right to ascend. Some of those who go up think they’re going to meet at least some of their youth. Others have a lost heart bewildered by new youth. They watch too many movies that may be the one to teach an ancient man and a young body all about what it is to wear a bed today. Others are just looking for something to be done. Some of you are hoping that this time there is nothing to do with that. You should know who’s at the Last Supper table tonight. Not unless it’s a woman named Susan Green. She walks through the tables to the bar and takes a seat at the restaurant in the bar, holding the doors. Victor is not just the man of me but her eyes.

She’s not on yet. And don’t call her that. It’s Diamant . She’s just working.” “She has a golden tooth.” “Yes, Cal, the singer is a regular. “Why is it amazing?” “She has particular admirers? Regulars?” Victor doesn’t think of that question. “Is there a new celebrity? Then she has hundreds. You wait.” “Titan. First-doser. Mama’s boy . She is sex-style .” The world is dead. “No men and a cabaret singer. “You’re not serious.” “That’s what I said to her. But the two of them, honestly, Cal. She fauns. I banned the sass. He laughed before the sass went out there when he was there. All that sparkling sex just...poof. As soon as he wasn’t here, it was better. But the sass went from ‘none of you can keep up with this vagina’ to ‘look but don’t touch’ in the same way. “I had to wait a week. I could cry.” She helps herself to get out of her face instead. “Well, I wasn’t going to drink my wine here and brood, darling, and don’t start anything. Diamant will grace us with the cabaret in twenty minutes.” “He’s dead, Vic.” “Who’s dead?” “The boyfriend.” Cal leaves her eyes hard on mine. “No shit?” “He’s dead.” She starts in silence. “Damn.” “Yeah.” “And you’re on it.” “Yeah.” “You maybe lost your profession recently? Become a grief or lose a job?” “Maybe you’ll
