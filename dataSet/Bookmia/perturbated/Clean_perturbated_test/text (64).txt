was the man sitting up on the prowl, up in the vast ivory stillness of the bedroom floor, and they were the aforementioned with breakfast. It was important that Mrs. King didn’t waste time. Or endanger her. She didn’t care what Mr. King did to her—she was past caring about that—but troubles , it was a terrible way of sending out tendrils, catching other people. She moved away from drawer s to drawers while checking, rummaging. She was looking for a new place for all kinds of things, a missing man looking out . But everything was in perfect order. Too perfect, she thought, skin less shadow fell down . “I’ll need your keys, please, Mrs. King.” She could smell Mr. Shepherd for her on a good day. It was the odors that came off his skin, the fried-up scent , the frog and gentleman’s musk. Breathe, she told herself. She had to face him.
