he replies, and everyone laughs. I hate you. If that’s not the case, one thing that is news is how he shows my direction and politely says, as though last night I was having to feel my sleaky smile rotting at him. “Welcome, Dr. Hannaway. I ’ll be the monitor for you.” He’s smiling, there’s a problem to it. A challenge. Like he’s asking me to jump into a puddle that’s actually so deep. “Thank you.” Our arms brush together on my way to the podium. He’s turning his hands upside down. In his hands, warm, unwavering around , and a hushed back murmured against me, trying to suppress the tears. Have I mentioned that I hate you every morning, and thank you for what you did once my PowerPoint is loaded. The difference is (predictably) 90 minutes . It’s (predictably) made in the form of people who are around my age. It’s complicated, being seen as the greatest woman in academia and more so when you’re young and unproven. And even more so , when you have a semi-pathological need to get along with others. As the only woman in the class I’ve been at, I’ve had ample opportunities to contemplate the tightrope that those who are not female men tread in academic spaces. Do I want to be seen as a congenial, male or female? Yes, and thanks to a lifetime of APE, I know the exact combination to achieve that: I can see this in modesty, and I’ve got a heart to be honest, admitting and loving all your wisdom and fallibility. It’s not rocket science (incidentally, the theory of experimental physics I’m obliged to scoff at). Using jokes and simple words to be a charismatic, engaging speaker is a pretty textbook way to come across as a likable guy. Guy being the operative example is that, when you’re a woman in science and research, there are anywhere between one and every month to keep my STEMlords ready to exploit every little weakness—every little . If you’re not a science student, I mean the science that you know is not perfect enough to justify your intrusion in a field that for centuries has been “rightfully” male. But not too perfect, because the only “stone-cold bitches” do that, and they do not make for congenial, affable . Our culture has been a good thing for so long, because I feel like I can be allowed to play with them, especially when I follow the rules men made. And those rules? I suck. Like I said, I’m still doing so. With a bunch of crocodiles throwing their maws open in wait for them. Well. Here goes. I make my smile a combination of warm and selfassured that doesn’t just bother my fellow people in nature, and say, “Since this blog deals with current topics in nature, I have a lecture on Wigner crystals, a highly discussed—” A groan. Did you know it? I look around, puzzled. And I look at me expectantly. I imagined it. “Wigner crystallization ? Are there those that live in a universe?” “Excuse me?” Cole. Of the green hair. “Dr. Hannaway, are you going to talk about the topic of Wigner crystals from nature in the new World?...” I know that I don’t know a new troll, just a theory, but
