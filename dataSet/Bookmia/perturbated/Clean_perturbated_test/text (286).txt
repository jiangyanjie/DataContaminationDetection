her. In my father’s life after that visit, I am a chubby, happy one-year-old in a flowered blouse and a long jumper, no doubt, for my age, boasting a toothy grin, chipmunk cheeks, and dark brown hair that sticks straight up in her head—despite my parents’ styling efforts—no one had ever told them about brown hair. My grandmother, who looks so good as I know of my father with her wide smile, broad nose, and brown hair so dark it could almost be like mine, reaches the hospital, and Dad props me from his back to bed. He must have known that the trip was an introduction as well , but Dad knew there was a special place of goodbye. As soon as I decided to be able to be there, and as soon as my mother died a few months later, a part of him was that she fell beyond her pain. * I remember to be patient. When I try to take care of my father as he was in the hospital, I get healthy and happy. I could see him working a busy afternoon dinner shift, wearing dark pants and a short-sleeved white dress shirt with a fennel pinned to it, chatting to his mom. He made a series of pizza s for most of my childhood, and I had no school and nothing else was available . For me, sometimes I’d go with him for part of the day, but remember following him into their kitchens in the predawn chill, watching friends take pictures and order the meal, and deciding the price of the pizza.

The place was filled with guests, an important smile on his face, because it was his job to keep them healthy and happy. As a child, I didn’t see his exhaustion at the last an open-to-close work a week when he’d take days off. I didn’t know about the abusive customers, the missed breaks and the unpaid overtime and raises that never came through. Sometimes a restaurant would shut down, go bankrupt, or disappear, and he had to scramble to find another position. I was in my thirties before my mother told me about another position he had missed out on, often given to restaurants in the United States, who would be cheaper to promote and relocate. “Isn’t that true?” I asked her, being guided by her pessimism honestly, and she said, “That was always the gift they gave him.” Anxious about infectious diseases and weary of hospital ization, my mother left respiratory-therapy and quit her school when I was in grade school. She lived for a few months in a cafeteria—I remember waving to her from the lunch buffet before my first child in seventh grade, which he shared my story and spent a hard
