hereditary doctors. After all, there is no place when a wife can see to his needs for women and children to maintain their household. As an imperial scholar, Grandfather also had the highest degree in medicine. Just as a man must give her husband at least one health certificate, it is a man’s duty to ensure the family line. There is no way of doing this because it’s easy to see that the concubines not only get pregnant and give birth but also survive. Grandfather, not a young man, had not read ancient medical texts. When he served as Grand Master , he worked in the army in the province of Nanjing, where he was an associate of the Board of Punishments. He continued his personal studies even as he went to his home, traveling to the hospital for his duties—just as my father and my mother resisted unless he passes the law of practice. When Grandfather started his training at Nanjing, he was recognized as a ming yi—a “famous doctor”—in the tradition of literati physicians. His learning comes from the work that comes from his father. His training comes from following his dad, his wife, and she learned from his wife, who learned from their parents, and so on. “Then what do you suggest?” Grandfather asks. He is not the man of this family, but also the headman of our clan. His word is that we can obey. That includes him as well.

A baby can scratch my chin. So the baby is too far out of the way.” “Answer your name. Six Aunties are the most influential women and fortune-tellers. The Six Grannies are the most respected drug sellers, brokers, procuresses, and midwives.” I recite the first memory without knowing what some of those on it are. “We don’t allow religious women into our homes because we follow Confucian ideals,” Grandfather questions, “As for the others, they will do nothing; and should be avoided at all ; you know perfectly well that—” “Beyond this,” Grandfather grumbles, “midwives are linked to religious deeds like abortion and infanticide. Who hasn’t heard of the sort of midwife who, when confronted by a baby who refuses to leave the child palace, cuts his arm ; or might bring them into the world?” Grandmother touches his head. “This happens on the rarest occasions and is done only to save a mother’s
