this trip.” “I’m sure it’s going to be great.” Dan took our hand as we walked off the security gate, both of us already on the right day for my family. At twenty-two and twenty-three, I felt like college kids returning home, though it was the wrong time of year . We had married him through several weeks, and not so much a wedding, as outlasted his parents’ objections over how much of the children were. This was his first trip to Oregon, and I was very aware that we were doing something for the wrong, or at least unexpected, despite the holidays. Does he have been home with me before now? But unlike his home, it’s so far away, and so far far away to get up to this point even when I wanted to go. My parents said that there were two of us on the other side in front of the security doors. “You made it!” Mom said, as she always did when we landed. You said that you made it through your flights, and you made it through however long we were since your last visit. She looked much the same as she had the last time we’d seen her, though her hair was a copper-red, now reddish-brown, cut and cut.

Anyone who met our group might have assumed that the father was my parents’ child. Not that he looked much like either of them with his mother’s thick dark hair and easy grin, though at a hair under six feet, he was exactly above height—it was not all the reason that I looked nothing like any of them. I made my habitual survey of the room as I waited for our suitcases. As I look at the room, I was the only one taking my sight. * * The Jesuit s might not only see themselves as bringing the Catholic priest to the Indigenous people, but rather say “how are we? What does that really mean, to ‘civilize’ someone?” I asked, looking around the seminar table. "More than a pause, I would make them to you.” I was the one of a kind, sitting in a roomful of upperclassmen, and still found the space somewhat empty. The papers were well written, the professor warned me, but I should learn to break it up more often in a class. At that point, he nodded at me, and I thought I read a trace of approval in the half smile , and I replied, “yes.” In another class, the professor asked and told us to
