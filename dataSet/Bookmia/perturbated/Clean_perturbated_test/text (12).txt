footing. You know how much the food you can make in case chivalry occurs, you know the dress in the ambience of the house, but, for extra measure, you should have made sure you tell at least one friend or family member who you’re going on, where you’re going and what time you expect to return—you know, just in the case of a neighbor, say “I think you should do it!” A man and his briefcase push into me and they get a dirty look (the man, my briefcase) and so on. My fault for stopping in and entering the street was the pedestrian traffic, but in case anyone cared about it, I’ve just discovered that Ben could be a serial killer and I his next victim. I move aside the traffic and get in the entranceway of a closed vehicle. Is a first date at his house normal? Nicole91: So I met this guy at a coffee shop and we are going to go back off. After reading the numbers , they gave me a break to see if I’d like to talk with him at his place. I’ve never met him once and I’ve got on his last date. I still don’t know him. I like him though and I feel like a genuinely good guy. I go to his house for a bit. Ted : That sounds like a good guy too. Kathy78: I think it’s okay to go to his house on his first date but only if you trust him. Anon: Trusting him doesn’t mean anything. We’ve all been duped before. What if people who know him have a night in his house, yeah he has first dates at his house? Not at all . It’s completely normal for him. We like him more than me if you just happen to be unlucky girl no. You know when he murders him. I hope everyone will back him up because, first of all he’s a man, secondly what idiot woman goes to someone’s house on the street (It’s not his fault she gave him the opportunity to talk to her, right?) And third, the woman he ’s been really pretty. It seems to be like yeah I met him. He was at his place and he was a gentleman and I’m still alive. If I was a murdering sociopath that’s how I’d do it. #justsaying . Simone_G: I think a first date at his place can be a little boring and that’s why we got to it in the end because he’s going to show you that he has a better way to live his life. It means finding a better way to live his lives. It means doing something long-term. Just let him know that he wants to know where you are. Leela: You know who you are. Run far and run fast. Helpful. Back to Lisa Fiener. Conversation: being caught off and stuck in silence is the bane of every other. It’s bound to be a long-term thing: if you don’t know each other well, or even if you’ve exhausted all your get-to-know-you questions to combat this, you’ll see a whole list of things you can talk about to keep the conversation flowing. Here are my favourite starters: To choose between the choice of four people in the world, dead or alive, who would you invite to a conversation? What’s your most treasured memory?
