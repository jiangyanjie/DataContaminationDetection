completely naked that I start to smooth my skirt over my skirt. My goal is to cover as much of myself as the fabric will allow. “I had a—” My voice . I’ve told this story a dozen times to so many skeptical people. Cops. State workers. Mr. Gurlain. “I had a patient. She had pain. By the time she found out, it was too hard. It was so painy, . . . everywhere. Surgery wasn’t possible. Chemo only went so far. There was nothing to do but keep her comfortable and wait until the end arrived. But the pain, well, it was excruciating.” I continue staring at my lap, at my hands, at my feet. At the level they are, I always cover my skirt. My lips aren’t as cautious.

It was better to place medications in a locked box , when it came to storing them on beds. That way only the caregiver has access to them. “Somebody had been tired. Or shaken by how much pain she was in. Whatever the reason, I’d forgotten to wear that bottle . I squeeze my eyes shut, trying not to stick a bottle lying on the side and side against the bedside .

A small circle colored with a shade of blue that I always thought was too pretty for something so dangerous. “During the night, I realized I had swallowed all but one of them,” I said. “She died while I was sleeping.
