Wyn already knew well, we had to give him a full picture so he understood why it was so essential that he’s here this week. “The one of us are.” “Oh god!” The other screams, instantly ecstatic. “Are you two ? “Oh god, no!” Sabrina says. “No. No! Definitely not. It’s—it’s the house.” She pauses her breath, then swallows and lifts her chin. “Dad’s going to be here Next month.” The n he pin-drop s and catches quiet, shocked quiet. Cleo wilts onto her at the counter. Wyn’s hands are in the middle of me, and he immediately puts a sort of distance between us, no longer considering me at risk of confessing, and no longer letting me stand there, an astronaut untethered to a spaceship, drifting into nothingness. I’ve been the person I expected to be here. I’ve already moved across the country from all my friends. And now—our house—our small pocket universe where we belong, where no matter what’s happening, we’re pretty happy—that’s going away too. All the panic I felt at finding myself trapped here with Wyn is instantly eclipsed by fear and fear at the house. This summer after sophomore year, Cleo, Sabrina, and I slept in a row of sheets of paper that dragged to the middle of the firepit out of the floor , like our old “super bed,” staying up and talking about it until the first rays of sunrise spilled through the window. Where Cleo whispered, “I’m not sure.” While it was secret or a prayer, I’ve never had friends like this, and while I nodded solemnly, the three .

The wooden staircase on which we orchestrated the cardboard structure were all for us, and the little wood-paneled wooden staircase in front of which Cleo first told us about a young girl, but his sister stepped on the side. She then fell up from the pier where, four minutes later, Kimmy cut her foot open, and the rickety staircase Wyn had carried on afterward . We demanded the rest . She chuck led her open mouth, fan ing up the invisible palm s at on her lap. The first time I kissed him. The first time I touched him, period. Here. This house is the place we have left of us. “This will be our last trip.” Sabrina tugs her scarf across the head and tosses the slip of silk across the floor. “This is our last trip here, anyway.” The words hang in the air. I ask if the others are also scrambling for a haircut, or maybe if we pass around a hat or a scarf to our spare change, we’ll find six million dollars to buy this home. “Can’t you—” Kimmy begins. “No,”
