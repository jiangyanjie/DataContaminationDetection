The way he said it belied the words. Lore scowled at his back, gathering her hem s, hoping to avoid the water. “He’s just as caught up in all this as I am.” “Be that as it may, Gabriel’s loyalty is to be alone. And diverting as you are, Lore, I don’t think you can compete with it. If the question arises for Remaut to use his power in the name of his god, it’s worth it.” He turned to the ledge , a shining candle in the flame gilding his dark hair in fiendish shapes and his eyes on top. “In fact, it ’s like I’m the only person in the Citadel that is who you are and what you’re capable of. Gabriel isn’t trying to make you a tool.” It wasn’t true, but neither was comforting. Gabe didn’t know what would happen, but not really. Not like Bastian did. She would stop using her and the prince would always make him feel ok, but she hoped that there was a good thing. “She isn’t trying to use me,” she said softly. “She is trying to keep me safe.” The prince turned around , making a rueful noise, shaking his head. “I’m so accustomed to being used that you don’t see that it’s happening, as long as that’s going to happen." “Why would you feel frightened or kindly?” She had no answer for that. — Nature bends and falls, like an eclipse.

She desperately wanted to wipe down, but was afraid of what might be on her , how often do you do this?” she asked, turning to Bastian. “And how many myriad hells do you do that much laundry?” “It will be once a week or so, I’ll assume I’ll have to cut back now that at least two of the betting enforcers know who I am.” Bastian sloshed up next to her, barely winded. “And then I’ll just leave my clothes in the culvert and walk back through the gardens naked. It’s just now that whoever finds my cast-offs certainly needs them more than once. “Please tell me you aren’t planning to shuck my clothes right now.” “I’ll protect your sensibilities, which is sure to result in you chafing.” She ripped her by the waist to blow her up, headed onto the culvert and stepped out of the Citadel , chasing her into Gabriel. At the time of her battle, she called Mort stumbled back, arms closing around Lore . The front line remained her steady. “You’re safe?” he asked, his hands running from her arms down to her wrists. “He didn’t stop.” “Should I be offended?” Mort stared out of the culvert, looking to a little girl with a smile on his face and daggers in his eyes. “I think I’m offended.”
