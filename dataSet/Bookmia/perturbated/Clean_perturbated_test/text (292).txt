Which is why I’m talking about things I knew to keep family matters private from outsiders but never considered the issues that we were possibly facing to the point where we never knew one another. “It’s not something to do — is it okay?” Mum quickly added. “Family matters need a different perspective,” said Mum. Will I finally move out? My refusal to leave hung on the fact that Dad needed someone more than me but Mum will be happy I won’t have to wait. I eventually leave my job, even if I have the chance ... Maybe I could get out more. A Meet up? I have an answer to Mum’s perpetual question. What if it hurt to go on a date, knowing I wouldn’t have to rush back up?
