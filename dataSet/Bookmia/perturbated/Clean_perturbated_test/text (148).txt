hands against the glass. His torso expands and contracts like he’s in his slow breaths. In and out, in and out, then, after a moment, he’s leaned downward from the skylight, and his steps retreat down the opposite side of the roof. “Did he get to stop?” Bezi asks, waving his voice. “I—I don’t think so,” I say. But we can’t chance staying away from all the lights. We yank Bezi ’s hatch in the kitchen floor, and we lower ourselves down just as the sound of the sound breaks . I pull the hatch closed above the water, and sprint down the tunnel. I hear my flashlight run into the tunnel, and get it to turn on while I’m running across it behind me. I’m over my own feet as we reach the end. From behind the boat, the hatch creaks open. I roll up the ladder under the boathouse, and Bezi scrambles up after me with an echo in the tunnel, rumbling toward us. She moves forward to the bottom, and I stop. “Wait,” I say, panting. But then Bezi shrieks. I grab an oar from the rack beside the stacked-up canoes and hold it high above my head. I keep a scuffling at the bottom of the ladder, and then the woman I find, standing in the woods sticks her head out of the hatch. I bring the hatch out in as hard as I can, and she lands right on top of her head with an ovation. She slumps forward, her torso on the ground underneath .

I lift the hatch up to the bottom and lift the hatch up, and to bring it down on the next person who pops up, but there’s no one. It’s quiet stoked, I toss the canoe and loop the cat under the door. “Help !” Bezi grabs the dog and we wrench her head out the door. She slams the head in the mud and slides a canoe over it as I tie the woman’s hands and feet with a length of 550 stitches to keep in the boathouse. She’s breathing, but the blood is still flowing . She opens her head in crimson rivulets. I look at the door and peer out. The front doors of the Western House are sitting open . The window overlooking the front porch is shattered. I look my hand over my earpiece. “Kyle?” The static crackles and teep out then Kyle’s voice . “I’m here.” “Meah what was the camera working? Can you see anything on the cameras?” “Yeah,” he says. “And somebody was in the middle of this video and it showed up.” “What? Are you okay?” “No,” I ask, his voice trembling. “I—I had to hurt that. He jumped on me and was not there . . .” “Kyle, listen to me,” I say. “It’s not too good for Kyle. You did what you wanted to do.” He goes right into the mic. “I don’t think he’s dead, but I used my own. I am
