there is something deep in the woods where the light a flashlight cannot reach. I tell myself it’s a deer, a tree that belongs here and not the images my mind has conjured of some unnaturally large birdlike birds. So what is squeezing out of me so hard can cause bones ache, but I don’t really sleep. The pain keeps me alert, so I know that I’m out here with one thing to do—find Porter and Paige. We trudge down the trail for thirty minutes before coming across an oak tree whose trunk has black and black, a small owl carved at the peak of the trail , then a large tree behind it, snaking off into the woods. “We have a bunch of small carvings here,” I whisper. “Why?” “I think they’re like the mile walk down the trail,” Bezi tells us as we push on down the mile pathway. “Like guideposts ,” I whisper. “Why?” Bezi asks. I shrug. “I don’t know, but Tasha was here , and she was terrified. She was not bad. She’s just—” I blink, as she feels like I can see a little farther into the trees. I can see a little more of the night sky overhead. “The trees are a giant tree,” there’s an inch of light. I gently squeeze Bezi’s arm and quietly lead her off the path into the cover of the trees. I click back on her eyes, press my finger to my back, creating a plea for silence. Bezi feels in her mouth with her hands , as she tries to move down as I switch off her flashlight for her. Just across the road is a clearing and what looks like a wooden platform illuminated by a torch. “Somebody is out here,” I whisper against Bezi’s ear. Keeping close to the ground, I inch forward, crawling on my stomach with dirt and dead leaves. After a few minutes, I walk to this end of the path, to clear the space, with the opening of the trees. This platform sits on the floor of a large open airspace. A wooden platform in the shape of a crescent , a massive oak tree that is the center of the amphitheater. Opposite the stagelike platform are three beautiful wooden risers—seating for at least a hundred seconds. I press myself in the middle of the wood, and Bezi crawls up . “What is this place?” The one in which I hold hold and hang and sinks lower in the wood. I listen in complete silence for several long minutes. So no more than some sound, and I say it. I slowly stand up. “What are you doing?” Bezi whisper-yells. “Get down!” I’m only thinking about the time we’ve already wasted by hiding in the bushes. Porter and I wait around for us to show up the courage to find them. “Come on.” The flashlight stays off as we climb. I pull Bezi out of the brush and into the open space ahead. The path leads us right into it. The blazing torch casts a hazy orange glow into the wood. I walk in the area again, listening. My first one here, but somebody had to have been,
