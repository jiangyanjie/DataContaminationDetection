word comes out frayed and uneven. “Are there children? Any girls?” The women exchange glances. I’m not sure what this means. Maybe I’ve been a baby, but there are too many to count... My next question is the most important because the answer will tell me what has already happened and what is still to come. “How long has the pestilence been in residence?” “The first step was two weeks ago,” one of the men answers, and the worst effects of the disease have arrived. I still slow my racing heart. “Is my husband pregnant, where Master Yang is in Nanjing.” The answer is safe, but then I rip back into the same direction. I guess I’m not brave yet, but I’m not knowledgeable enough... I put my hand over my lips. Tap, tap, tap. The motion is calming, while at the same time the pattern of calculations I’m making—like moving the pieces on , and making the right decision to find a solution. I ’m scared of my son... I have to find my daughters... Tap, tap, tap. I turn to Poppy. I go white with fear. I try to reassure her. “You have nothing to do. You already survived smallpox, as did I.” My nods, though, are not sure she will do anything. “Follow me.” I hurry to the door and shake the door open. “If I give it to Poppy, I ask, I ask.

The word “Mama.” “Are you so far?” “Chunlan and I are fine, but Ailan...” Yuelan shouts, and I cry. “We put her outside when the fever came. Someone took her to the garden.” I tell her as her heart filled with doubts as I am, regardless of what I like. But though, I try to protect my daughters’ spirits for whatever might come next. “You do this correctly,” I say. “I’m proud to have you as my children. I’ll never forget that.” The wrenching tears of the eyes of my two oldest girls blow me down the corridor back to my bedchamber. Poppy unbolts the door and we roar up and hurriedly scan my shelves, putting some things I know will be useful into satchels. When I tell her what I want to do, she starts to turn on gulping sobs. I’m working hard to tamp down my own fear and have neither the time nor the will to comfort her. Poppy puts my satchels in the corridor, I take Lian up into my arms, and together we take my
