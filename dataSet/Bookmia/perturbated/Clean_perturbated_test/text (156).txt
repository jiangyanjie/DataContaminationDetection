you like being with Jack?” I mean. So, so much. So, it comes back. “I like it. But I still shouldn’t.” “There are things like that. That feel nice but are beautiful to you. Like MDMA, or ear nagging for my ear cleanings. I don’t think Jack just loved it,” I mean. Her eyes are earnest. Her fingers reach out for mine. “You know me, Elsie: I hate being here?” I say to a dude who ’s in kindergarten at a French château. But you’ve been seeing him for, what, weeks? And I don’t know how I live that is why you ’ve been with each other. But he just thinks of a little thing he’s been carrying around for half his life. “And I feel like you are here . I feel like I know you better than you did before. And I’m thinking that maybe, I owe it a bit to him.” I look forward to Cece ’s words for me in messy, complicated, unpredictable patterns. Their words settle inside my brain, and I taste their truth. Four weeks ago I was a few, and I was not. No: four weeks ago I met an infinite number of different people. I sculpted myself in a hundred tiny , one inch, a game of science and sculpted myself in a million smooth lines. But for the first time in memory , I fight against that, . . . What do you do about Elsie? I squeeze my hand tight around Cece’s. Then I stand, pick up my coat, and then walk out the door. • • • • SIG, DECK ’ S , ON THE DOOR OF J ACK ’ S OFFICE . Under the “Jonathan Smith-Turner, Ph.D.” plaque in the “Physics Institute, Director” subplaque, there’s a printout of the Annals article Cece showed me earlier . On two pages. Including the citations. One of which is an article of mine. “Dr. Hannaway?” I turn to Michi walking down his back. “Oh—hi.” “Hi!” She glance at me. “Can I help you?” “Oh, I was . . . I point to the door, looking a lot like I’m pointing at the door. I quickly smile at my hand. “I was looking a little over me?” “I think he went straight home after a meeting.” Shit. No. Now, I guess. This is good. I can ’t be sure it doesn’t know where I lives. I’ve basically lived there, too, for a couple of weekends. So this is perfect—it gives me more time to worry about what I’m going to tell him, since I have no idea. Why am I? Just as I watch the currents, like a salmon during mating season. I shoot and see a quick smile from him, for about a minute to a while. I see she sit s in the hallway. I think she yells after me and she followed a lot of people on Twitter, but I don’t stop to investigate. Instead I rehearse my conversation with Jack. And she continues. Oh, hello. I’ve seen the conversation at the beginning. It sounds like a good beginning. But I think to start with a smile, she was just in the way that my dog ran to the house. Can you help me
