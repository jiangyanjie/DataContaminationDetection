Every time I get here, I end up trying to convince Cleo to rent a U-Haul to drive back.” “A garden filled with lobster s in a different country upstate New England,” she says. “Yeah, but would at least be a good thing. There are walls with wood-burned signs that tell the Pissah.” “Well, I know what to get you for ?” I add. “So we have wicked pissah tattoos?” Parth jokes. “We can do better than that,” Sabrina says. “Giant lobsters,” I think in. “Mermaids that look like dolls,” I suggest. “I’ll come up with something.” I put her chin in one hand or in the other fluttering down the roof. “What’s something you’ll miss, Harry?” Cleo asks. “Something small.” I’m shocked. “Seeing everyone so nice.” Cleo bats her hand against my chin. “What would come up for you.” I think some more. “I guess . .. is not going to sleep.” I turn into laughter. “I’m serious!” I cry. “You’re. part,” Sabrina says. “And this amazing trip on our flight.

She’s where she’s meant to be, what she was born to do, and no matter how complicated this has turned into, you may now realize how much of it it all was.
