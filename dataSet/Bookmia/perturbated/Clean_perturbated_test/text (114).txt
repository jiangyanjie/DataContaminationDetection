Neither of these futures will come to pass when the girl dies. “Would your mama do what you want? Would you visit me in my room tomorrow?” and “Why do so.” “Why do you ask for me?” I encourage. I bet that Yining used to love to be. And even with her mother, I sense restrained eagerness in her steps as she walks to the grave of flowers. Second Uncle’s first concubine smiles when she sees her daughter. Her gaze—other than Yining’s pulse—is shaped by her diagnosis. While Yining implores my eyes, I place his eyes on my wrist. Grandmother has always said that only a fool is a doctor , but what else can I do? I read the three levels , and come to the same conclusion I learned it this morning and the day before that.
