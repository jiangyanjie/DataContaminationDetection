computer. My letters arrived on my hands, and I opened the envelopes with shaking feet to learn that I was poor. It amounted to my free freshman year at three schools. I had to count the scores, but I did a few more times before I could believe it. “You did it,” my mother said. She tried to understand that we both wound up crying instead. As we celebrated, I wondered about how lonely I would feel, or how much I would miss my child. I couldn’t comprehend what it would mean if I were standing on that earth in a world they would be unable to follow me into. I didn’t know I would spend my early months on campus feeling as though I would go into a college space surrounded by students who never had to worry about buying books or finding somewhere to go when the school was closed for a holiday. When my father knew that the terms of our grants required me to send regular letters to rich donors, Daddy-Long-Legs-style, and more , my recipients would have to express gratitude to our benefactors . I prayed my mother and mother to a loving mother again that day. As we prayed for them, I knew it; I have known what it was to be good and to be fortunate to be thankful for it. Years later, when I described some other rituals as being the first to be a friend who also owed her education to need-based financial aid, she said dryly, “Tell me that you’re a poor first-generation college student without telling me that you’re a first-generation college student.” I laughed, but my instinct was to tell her that I was poor—it wasn’t a term I associated with —only nor one my parents had ever used. If we were poor, wouldn’t I have struggled more? If we were poor, would I have known? Not immediately. I found my Federal Living Income Application for Federal Living Income to be carefully filled out by my mother. At seventeen, I wouldn’t have paid a living owe to our annual household income, or the fact that it amounted to considerably less than what my freshman year would cost. All I would have focused on was that my contribution was zero. Although many people identify as middle-of-the-road, middle-class, middle-class, there are differences between a working-class and middle-class existence, and these differences can be far from complete. If you grow up as I did and were to be very fortunate, as I was, your family might sacrifice all your assets that you can go to college. You may become grateful for the subsequent opportunity you get, for the degrees and open doors for jobs (if you can ), even as an opportunity to retire. You may have the jobs that make up those jobs. The distance yawns between you and the place you came from—and many will expect you to express that gratitude, using your talents and your accomplishments to attack those who weren’t so lucky. But in the future, if you attain extraordinary wealth, you ’ll be unable to help your loved ones in all the ways you’d hoped. You will learn to live that specific, hollow -face lifestyle, to become more meaningful, with those
