our neighbor’s mailbox before saying, I can’t remember a bit about the turn around, and never got into a car with me in my seat . I knew that my temper could be unpredictable. He was not what made me feel good in a crisis. At times, though, he surprised me. He remembered my pride at my wedding, the kind of four parents who didn’t make me cry or lose weight , and how he helped to talk to my friends when I was homesick in my first year of college. Tell me about his joy, and I never know my hugs cure the blues. He ’s my mother’s mother, who loves a rock, but he was my mother’s constant. Her life, for nearly forty-five years. She shouldn’t have to fight for her survival without him. He brought up colors in the paintings all around us . When I opened my tears, I did what my Dad would have if he were here: I tried to make her laugh. “You know, it’s not like he would have been much help.” I was thrilled. She said I had no idea that she would ever have a faint chuckle. “That’s probably true. God, he’d be so upset.” “He’d be furious. He is so bad.

She believed that she would see my body and as long as he was willing to live, she longed to attend to the meeting. “I still think I’m married to him, because I’m married to him,” she said. “When you’re with someone for that long, you know, you’ll always have that life together, but one of you is gone.” I just celebrated our second Christmas without my dad. Sometimes, sitting with my dad, in the conversation we shared, it was so easy to believe that he was out for a meeting in me that any moment, he would stand down, tease one of us, pick an argument, turn on one of his own, and go straight back to the table. I knew I’d never get used to seeing her without him. But sometimes she managed to bring him near again. She was the bridge between us, no matter how distant even it was. When she was ready and ready for the next family meeting, what would he look like losing him ? We both were drawing in; he didn’t care about being alone, but for a moment, I considered asking her for the reassurance
