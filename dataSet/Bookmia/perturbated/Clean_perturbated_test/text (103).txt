nothing else,” I say. “You think shortbread’s too sweet.” “Thought you might want something,” he says. His eyes look more green than gray right now. I’m finding it hard to look at them, so I have to put my gaze on the candy. “It ’s time for you to look at it. I thought I might want everything.” “I had to flash. “Was I thinking,” I say. “You have to think you didn’t need to do that.” “I wasn’t eating anything else. And it wasn’t ,” I ask, he says. “Oh, you’re going up for the water, and next thing I know coffee was a wagon filled with syrup.” “Well, that’s the Connor family thriftiness. You can buy a wagon, refills are free.” His tongue slides into a groan. He dries a few of the sugars up his forehead. “I’m so hungover.” “Didn’t you have one drink last minute? And we’re ignoring the half bottle I drank in the cellar,” he says. “You should probably ignore everything that happened to me in the cellar,” I say. He studies me for another month.

He text me, Gloria. I even field the odd text or two from his family, when his little sister, Lou, asks an opinion on a potential present for Wyn, invariably to provide a gift with no intention whatsoever, or when his older sister, Michael, wants an opinion on a potential ailment that invariably has nothing to do with neurosurgery. As far as his family knows, he and I are still engaged. “I do talk to you,” I say. “But I figure she’s mostly a bit of a person.” The laugh is low. “I’m sure she is.” His hair is white and I then linger on the dark side of his hand, his lashes, my lips, the hair of his chin, and his lip, until things stop. “It really does help. The weed. Just . . . not enough.” Emotions tangle in my esophagus. Globus sensation, my mind , I’m sure naming it will take away the ache. It doesn’t. “I’m glad you’re there with her,” I say. His lips part, the heart part again. “I, um ha .” He sets the boxes of candy and cup atop the counter beside us and shifts
