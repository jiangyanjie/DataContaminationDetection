could almost say he was going to have a camera in the blue slice of my eye. I use it as a way to get started with my talk. • • A FTER THE TEACHING HE COULD USE A NAP , BUT MY day is booked full. I have a chat with the dean of the School of Science, a pleasant guy who sips coffee from a tentacle mug that has me pondering his porn preferences. I get an informal lunch with the school profs— clearly a couple a few miles from the lovers’ spat, which results in him staring at my salad while they bicker over someone named Raul. Afterward I get a short break (spent figuring out whether my insulin pod is acting up or not and a hint of paranoia) followed by a little meditation. One-on-ones are, of course, what I’m best for simple math: being the Elsie one -on-one is much easier than negotiating between the two groups , and asking questions about the demand. These interviews are ostensibly for me to ask questions about the work they offer; the interviews will help me decide whether to accept an offer, but let’s start by telling you that (1) my current job is a bukkake , and (2) I don’t work out interviews on my daily routine: I like academic programs, and the academics hate service with the intensity of a thousand quasars.

It’s going to be a while since I’m doing it. A tell myself as a gangly grad student tasked with escorting me around takes me to my seventh class of the day. I am projecting about the name plaque right? “Here ,” she says in a bar with a black door. I stare at the name plaque for a second. Briefly consider the name. Resist my base impulses and tell her, “I thought it might be a mistake. My itinerary for my first class is with Dr. Pereira.” Was I looking at it after what I overheard last night? But I cannot report him or his situation to the HR without admitting that I broke into a family when he was fully ready to make him uncomfortable with passiveaggressive questions about whether he’d be willing to attend my classes if I were to start a family. She feels like it had become my freshman year and I was getting his student to do it. “There was a mistake in Dr. Pereira’s slots.
