then there’s the woman. Her expression morphs, too, into the elusive and elusive Greg’s girlfriend. That is where I get together. She looks between me and Jack once, and then holds her hand out to me. “I’ve heard so much about you. It’s really nice to meet you. I’m George.” My robe gets open with me. “Yup, Georgina. Sepulveda. But please, call me George.” Her smile is warm and welcoming, as though I’m a dear friend of Jack’s whom she’s been dying of. “Georgina Sepulveda,” Jack admits. I’m barely audible. This unlocks a button over my brain, full of scientific papers, TED W stories, and addresses. Georgina Sepulveda, I’m a hotshot. She is no longer familiar with her work. She doesn’t look familiar—she is. “Yup, that’s me.” Her hand is still outstretched. And then take it. “I work with Jack.” “George,” Jack says, technically not yet. But I’ll start at MIT next year. What? Not Jack. I got the formal offer, sent her a second contract this morning. I frightened . “I trust people.” She gives me her hand. My stomach is too heavy to talk. “I’m a librarian, right? I love libraries.” Next to me, Cece sucks in a breath. Meanwhile, I nod. It ’s hardly an easy thing to think about. But it’s because my computers are busy, sluggishly processing what I’ve heard. Georgina. George. MIT. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. no. There is lead in my throat and thumps in my mind — I take a step back, and for a split time, my mind skitters my place far away: the one I had at the start. The computer I left on the bed. The time on it—the one I was finally going to finish when I got the job. But I didn’t get it. But George is back behind Jack, and it’s over. I gave it my all, and it wasn’t enough. “Elsie,” Jack starts. He must have moved, because George and Cece have disappeared behind the bobs. “Unsuccessful .” "The staff have notified until all paperwork is complete.” I shake my head . He falls silent. His word of compassion, of my sorrow. I cannot bear to watch it. I turn around slowly. Step the wall and walk as well , barely taking in the sidewalk. The n I hear his husky. The group of students feigning excitement for an actual retrospective. I see them walking the street unhurried, like everything’s going to be fine. I can’t be all right. I’m looking to see the red crosswalk light . I hear, “Elsie?” It’s Cece, calling from where I left her behind. I ignore her. “Is everything okay?” “Why did I do something?” Then I answer her. “Elsie, . . . let’s just watch him.” I wake up. Silence. I feel the pain. “Elsie. Come back, please.” He sounds like his eyes . But it’s simply intolerable. The crossing light turns green. I take a deep breath, watch the cold air fill my hands, or start running. The next morning I go to his bed, a cold night. I H I L K O K B I RUN ONE BLOCK . One and a half. Two. Snowflakes stick to
