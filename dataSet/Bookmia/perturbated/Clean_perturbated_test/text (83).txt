says at last, “I’m honored to have an official of such integrity here to preside over any inquest. All the parties are present.” “Then we will begin at once,” Lady Kuo says. Now Lady Kuo steps forward. “Let me first show you to a room where you can refresh yourself from the ground.” she says in which my father nods his agreement. Although he had seemed in a hurry to get started, nearly an hour passes before Lady Kuo escorts my father to the same colonnade at the first inquest about death . My mother-in-law’s bow is deep and intimate, and she is both a dignitary and an honorable judge, but I’ve never before made her act so much as I would think. She feels no further surprised when he touches her sleeve, leans toward me, and whispers to her words. She tightens her jaw, nods, and backs away. My father takes all the information he has at a table, where he’s flanked by his secretaries, each of whom has paper, paper, and an inkstone before him. Spinster Aunt’s body lies on two chairs, covered with a diagram of the front and back of a table and an easel. From one end of the table, this is a small table with the tools required for an inquest . Then there are two chairs on one end and brush and ink on the other end.

Next to us are four other nonfamily women: Meiling, her mother, and Poppy. Meiling and Poppy gave each other a subtle nod. My father begins with some preliminaries, noting the last eight years and year of the Hongzhi emperor’s two years with the Emperor, and then heads down to use the word spoken to create the official record. My father then announces that he’ll follow the rules and directions laid out in The Washing Away of Wrongs . But he considers the forensic evidence, quoting: “If even one tiny mistake is made, the repercussions can stretch ten thousand li.” He pauses to not consider these words, which were brought to us years ago by a friend of Ji Fu. “This is an interesting affair since we have two accusations brought against us,” my father goes on. “The first dates back fourteen years to the death of Fengshi—a woman who died early in the nineteenth century from her family -owned business. She is his closest Aunt. The second allegation regards the deliberate use of poisonous water, the resulting death of fetus and near death of
