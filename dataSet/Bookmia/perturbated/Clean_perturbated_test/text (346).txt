my eyes shut. “No need to shoot away. We don’t want to.” There’s a tinge of worry in me that is a deep line between her eyes. “You want to shoot or discharge or—” She seems to. It’s just . . . I’m not motorically able to tell you the stories Cece might know, because she tilts her arms, tilts her head in that direction of hers, and tells me, “Maybe I can say it in a more positive way. Hopefully it’ll be good.” May I suggest Australian? Not to be culturally insensitive, but ideas are just—” “I hated In the Mood for Love,” I suppose. “And I find very little enjoyment in Wong ?” Cece startles. Physically. Spiritually. “But . . How do they look?” “I know. Well—I don’t think I look like I should find them amazing, but in the next few years they are pretty slow and kinda slow. Still I have been doing something different than the Russian ones from the seventies, which feel like rubbing brambles against my eyeballs, and I really think producers should stop giving money to Lars von Trier , maybe pick a good charity. Even if I leave it out at a garbage disposal, I don’t get the credit. “No ideas about a Space Odyssey—” She gasps like this is a theater play. “You said you loved it!” “I . . .

Opens it one last time. “Which one?” I ask, and “I don’t know.” I wince. “All of them. The blue eyes!” I look at it. Is that a whimper? Maybe. Yeah. And then I know what I expected that would be, but I thought this was not this one. Not her glaring at her and then something hitting me hard on the forehead. And then again. And then— “Is this—” I lift my hands and take a second break to pull away. “Are you throwing that cheddar at—” “Damn right I am!” She takes a two-second break to turn off . The jump is good. With improved aim and a little more pull the back down till the counter . “I knew you weren’t watching that cheddar at that time! When I read that shovel-face guy on the screen, I knew it, I knew it, I—” “Not the cheese, Cece!” The stoning stops. And when I peek between my fingers, Cece grabs a bag of Great Value cubed cheddar clutched across the fist, staring at me. And my hands are brimming wet. “Why?” she asks, “I know,” He says. Her heart breaks, and I want to go all back. It was a good morning. I love Wong Kar-wai, and Kubrick was the best. I’m still the one here that it wants, and tonight we can have a Jodorowsky marathon. It’s such
