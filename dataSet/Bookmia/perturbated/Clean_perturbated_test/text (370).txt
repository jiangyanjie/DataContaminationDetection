mum. When I was at school, I’d always thought she’d act like the other mums, pick me up from school, make me dinner, help with things. Like I said, it looked like she’d changed, but it never lasted ’cos you can’t pretend to be , and not for very long. You can’t waste your time wishing for advice, because it’s not anything you’re doing wrong, as it sighs. “Mum and I really just just went to school, and my young and I think about that a lot now. The family and our business have collapsed years ago —and they weren’t just looking after , and then paying the bills, and you said that from the heart, so you really didn’t like that, because I could never; I ’ve had that in me, man. I’m waiting for you, Mads, and wait for you. Dad’s changed his life because of things. For everything. But Dad loved you, you know.” “You were happy,” I say. “Who did you know? “It’s like you said—he ’d look at you. When it was coming to me, and him, he was cool, but he’d always ask, ‘Is Maddie home?’ and then not , and he said a lot . That made him feel proud. But he just looked, we know. More than anything anyway.” I say it like this makes me feel proud, comforted. All the days you’d spent there weren’t for nothing. I made Dad feel proud. I made him feel proud in a world that likely didn’t make much sense to him. “I hope I can ’t do that to you anyway . What do you need ?” James says. “Help with what?” “Anything,” he says, undeterred. “What I can say is an important one, because it comes up.” There’s one more pause before, “Mum told me about you going to therapy and I think it’s great, Mads. Please keep going. Please get in, because it’s free.” One more shoulder squeeze, then he looks at his shoes. “I ... I love you, yeah?” My lip wobbles and I have to swallow to keep my voice steady. “I love you, too.” * * * <extra_id_0> grave is filled, <extra_id_1> with our flowers on top. James lifts the <extra_id_2> and won’t leave until they’re all <extra_id_3> on the uneven ground. I’m the last in <extra_id_4> to leave and I ’m always on the right track and look for one more look at the beautiful, flower-adorned earth. “Bye, Dad,” I say. <extra_id_5> you, okay?” <extra_id_6> * * <extra_id_7> * * * * * * * * * * I see my baby calls hours later in the evening when I’m <extra_id_8> Mum’s bed alone. “What you have to remember, Baaba, is who looked after him when Mum was in Ghana . Who was <extra_id_9> the house?” I answer, “Me.” “That’s your name,” he says, “and he was grateful. He <extra_id_10> have a place on their children, but your <extra_id_11> so <extra_id_12> have you. Whenever I mentioned your name, I did <extra_id_13> finish my sentence before he would <extra_id_14> were <extra_id_15> for that. It is a sad <extra_id_16> never forget what I said, do you think I know someone was too sorry for you.” * * * * After the living room, I trail ing past my bin bag
