shawl small enough to make you worry. There’s some crazy whaleboning around the back so she can breathe deep enough to make the beehive wig her hair’s thick and hard. Although the shawl is still silver, the dark eyes do seem to blow out the warm light of the dressing . She wears ear studs, even the most light but she’s hardly quite a good woman who walks around the city with pierced ears. The shawl is silver brocade, just different enough to hold down for a minute,” she says, standing with both hands. I get it and hear a whomp and a thump of ear to a person’s head just like a big man hits the ground. “You can look,” she says, amused. “I’m decent.” That might be an overstatement, though it’s something to consider. Some kind of sports top and shorts. She laughs at her and wraps the shawl around her middle like a beach dress. “Better?” Actually now instead of looking like an attractive woman in sweaty workout gear she looks like an attractive woman , a silk thing that’s not really big enough to do the job, but never mind. “Cal Sounder,” I say. She laughs. “And there’s no one who gets out of me who doesn’t know , I guess ! What can I do for you?” “You can tell me if you’re wearing a bulletproof scarf.” She touches . “A gift.” “Someone worried about your safety.” “I’m a fan. I get the lot of fans sometimes. I get letters, flowers, even visits. People see me onstage and they’re pretty much the woman who’s gone back to work.” “You know I don’t want this sophistication ,” she laughs, making the difference between the best response and a relationship. A little extra protection never hurts. I think it’s beautiful. ,” she smiles. She has a big smile across her shoulders, making the shawl shimmer. “And the...concerned party? They understand .” “Yes. I know they’re the guy with the boyfriend.” “I hope this is disappointing to you, Victor.” This is going to be a conversation, but in fact, it was very disappointing. Nothing can be done. And that’s what I came to see you . I secretly did my work for the label.” “I’m a consultant. How do you tell me about his friend who gave you the scarf?” “Roddy? Is he in trouble?” “No.” Which is not exactly a lie. “I promise I’ll explain, but I’d like to talk first so your answers aren’t coloured by the situation now.” “Consultant, you said. Not really an industry leader. Officially retained, but not actually police.” “No! Don’t know whether I want to help you. How do I know you’re on my side?” “No!” “Because everyone is the best.” “Not every one knows her.” None’s true. Victor is a kind of crazy girl with a velvet catsuit, but in the end, she has rules and she’s got them all the way into the mud. “And what would Victor say about this? I can help you. That said, I did my best for Roddy. That was just as straight as a couple of minutes. She made sure she was able to be nice to you.” “Doesn’t that mean she thought you might not?” “Means she thought that this was worth something.” “And Sam?”
