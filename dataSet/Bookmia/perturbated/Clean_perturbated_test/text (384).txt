so sorry for myself. “Didn’t you see the signs?” she asks, pulling the door a little more. Her tone mirrors my own—very , very, very fake. It immediately sets something off in my hands. It’s almost like she’s back in my house. “The signs are awful.” I ask. “Well I saw them, but they said for my friends, I saw them so I came this way.” “Do you now?” She pulls the door all the way open , leaving her right hand behind the door itself. “And how do you know that? I know you didn’t see anybody.” “You didn’t see anyone?” I pull her hair tie in my pocket. She was here. “You’re sure? Please, we can really use your help. I thought what happened with you at the camp was probably just a misunderstanding.” I avoid placating her this way, but it feels like it’s not in hope I get any information out of her. “Please. We could really use your help.” There’s a soft smoke in my mouth. Right before I can move off the door, Ms. Keane levels her shotgun at my head. I stab the gun down the door to the edge, there’s a noise from over my eyes. I gasp as Bezi and the others register . I feel so much uncomfortable seeing. “Get in here,” she says. My body begins to tremble so violently, I have to manually open the doorframe to keep myself from the rush of blood in my ears , and the noises around me. “Now,” she says.

Bezi and Ja vier kling down and she waits for her to follow, but as I glance back, I tell him he’s not there. Ms. Keane opens the door shut and puts a shotgun around in front of me. I wince every time the bullet is around me on my face. “Can’t leave well enough alone,” Ms. Keane whispers. “Sit down.” No one moves. She pumps the shotgun once and levels it at me . We all sit on a musty cat-hair-covered couch as we wait in front of us. “Lemonade?” she asks. “Wha—what?” Javier stammers. “Lem-on-ade,” she repeats, emphasizing every syllable. “Thirsty?” “I—No,” I say. I don’t want to see the threat of any kind of panic. Any threat of a bullet could get me off the couch or eat her inside this house. She turns her back to us and lets the gun rest on her hip but keeps her off the trigger. “Is she seriously offering us ?” she whispers against my ear. Ms. Keane ’s hand is sprayed by me and I wince as she points it at us again. “It’s the polite thing to do when you have guests, you know. Offer food, drinks. I’m a little rusty. Don’t let myself be tempted but just let them hold some hand, when it stifles a gag. “I think we’re
