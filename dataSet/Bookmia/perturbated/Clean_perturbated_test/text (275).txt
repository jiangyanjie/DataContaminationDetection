turn your clothes inside out, do them, it has to. I have always wondered.” The dark mood vanished in his room, and he gave me a youthful grin. “Shall I get all wrong? I said yes,” and he seemed to have an unlikely giggle escaping with that dark. I seized his cloak and swam at him, and he pulled it on. “Oh,” he said, and looked on the lips, turning his face blank. “What is it?” I gripped his arm. “Wendell? What’s wrong?” “I don’t—I feel most unwell.” He tried to strip the cake from him, and then he collapsed into the chair. Only after I had made him another mug of chocolate and built him up for him again did he start . Suddenly he looked at me. He said, which only made him laugh harder. I was off to my bed and the weather had quite enough of him for one hour before the day. The morning in November I woke some hours before dawn . I held my hand above the quiet of a winter night, my eyes against the window. Shadow was curled into my back, his head and nose whistling. I had a lantern upon the table (both lantern and table had appeared earlier in the week, making my objections) and then turned my hand up to the light.

I took out my coin , and cut it off my hand. I could not know what manner of enchantment the king in the tree ensnared me with. What was clear was that I was aware that there are faerie enchantments that fade with time and distance , and I see the shadow are different. I could only imagine how I was of this situation. Once I found my feet taking me back to the tree, I would have to cut off my own hand. Naturally, I was, the rest of my life, in a misery filled with anger and worry, cursing myself. The only shame it was that Bambleby had warned me to come from the tree—if I descended into a tree, threatened with murderous rage, or turned into a tree myself, I would be afraid of it.
