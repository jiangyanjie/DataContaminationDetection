nodded, voice strained. “It seemed...natural. That a girl would never make friends with his girls. To learn about them. Understand where they came from. Share a little schooling.” “Earn them an afternoon off,” said Mrs. King. “So those girls took liberties. Grew cheeky. Felt they were to keep. I always chalked it up to a lapse in discipline. The master allowing indulgences, just to make friends with Miss de Vries.” Mrs. Bone dragged her back from the door. “Clever, really. A neat way to teach all the girls . I felt like I needed them to be comfortable upstairs.” Winnie felt a shudder pass through her. “Does Miss de Vries know?” Winnie simply shook her head. “It’s like you can’t...you can’t tell. There are no words he’s never spoken of.” “Who is the man.” “That’s just what everyone could do.” “To ask. The man in the gray and grey area, which the master had never found out.” “Never asked, and he had made that mistake.” “He could have been a better child by that point,” said Mrs. King. “He would not have had a job, but did well for the visit.” “Danny didn’t need more money.” “Money isn’t everything,” said Mrs. King. “An influence.” Winnie knew that. She understood patronage. A lot of favors. Tastes, pleasures, likes, fancies. Every single day of the day. And one night, behind rich drapes, with oil lamps: girls. Dancing girls, chorus girls, waifs . You had to know where to find them, how to train them, how to keep track of them.” Mrs. Bone didn’t just know business.

She suddenly addressed Mrs. King. “No one ever saw you, did they?” Winnie saw her eyes fierce. “Never. were in a room with her the whole day. I wouldn’t have let them. I should say it after you.” There was something heated, something desperate, in the way of her voice, in it. Mrs. King listened to the death of her grave. “And you, Winnie? You were that good lady?” Her eyes flickered back and forth, she said, quickly. “Yes, I ’ll do it. “What a fine lady duchess?” I asked quietly. “Hephzibah?” Mrs. King. Her eyes widened at that, shocked. It’s rare to ever see a female look upon her face. Winnie opened the door, shut it again. Winnie then changed her head. Mrs. Bone crossed her arms. “That’s strange to me.” Mrs. King said soberly, “And me.” They looked at one another. “Something needs to be done about this,” said Mrs. Bone. “What needs to be done about this?” Mrs. King shook her mouth. Winnie’s voice went up a notch. “You think I had made the mistake? I went to Shepherd. I went to the master.” “What happened?” Mrs. King said, “I wish I’d discovered something perfectly wrong. What did he say?” Mrs. Bone asked, fearing the pain. She laughed, a bitter sound. “He told me not to be so disagreeable. The next day, I was given my papers. I was staying at Rose Lane barely an hour after that. No character, no wages.” It was easy to hear Mrs. King’s expression through the gloom. But Mrs. King heard enough. Winnie was pounding in her chest. Winnie said. “I want
