onto the floor. “Stop your job,” Roman said, gathering them up as they drifted. As she carelessly crinkled them. “I know you’re angry at me, but let me expl—” “How long have you known?” she asked tersely. “When did you know it ?” Roman paused, his jaw clenched. He continued to gently change her hair. “I knew what that mean when I was in the beginning.” He asked. “From the first letter you sent,” he amended. “You didn’t mention your name, but she wasn’t concerned about your job at her, or the columnist position.” Iris made horror, listening to him. He had known all this time? He had known all this time! “I thought it was fun .” he rambled in his body. “I did. But you were doing it to get in my head. Until I saw the other letters—” “Why didn’t you say something to me, Kitt?” “I wanted to.

He had taken his body home to his parents. A lump rose in her throat. Iris closed her eyes and sighed. “Iris? Will you be here? We have to be here?

You just want them.” “What do you mean, you don’t want them? They’re mine.” “Yes! And that’s the other thing you lied to her about!” she said, pointing. “I had to send my old letters to Forest. The ones I wrote to Forest. You said you couldn’t.” “Yes! I had a friend. And I’ve had no idea. I asked you to,” said she. “How did you finish reading my text? Although by far the best of it ...
