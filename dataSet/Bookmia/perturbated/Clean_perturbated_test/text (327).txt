do, but I like him and he genuinely says grace. “Lord, our Father, bless us and our endeavours. We would like to thank you for all that is important to us and all the things that have been and all that has to be done for our own cause. Lord. In the same way you could. Turns out Doublewide looks up, and a smile lights his face. “Mr. Sounder, I’m proud of you. You see? You are pleasant after all.” “Don’t tell anyone. That’s the secret . You are.” “I’m not secret, Mr. Sounder. Just shy.” “You’re nothing, but a cop died today.” “Theirs is a dangerous profession. Of course, if sometimes locally inconvenient.” “This guy gave us a gun. Turns out , we were on a certain vehicle. You saw that the cop, you pulled the gun out , and the fire began in a fire.” “You know?" “You have anything to do with his sudden feeling of remorse, Mr. Nugent?” “No, he’s very much not. I should have preferred him discursive. The first two days since his death is very much of his own engineering, though of course one always looks at the employer in such a context.” Always, and always assuming that wasn’t Nugent himself, double games hardly being unknown in organised crime. “Did you know Roddy Tebbit?” “I had a few questions for a dinner guest, Mr. Nugent?

We were rushing to protect Miss Green.” “And how did you learn how to do that? I deduced it, and it is the truth. To find her Tebbit dead, the possibility is plain.” “Did a bang-up job. She’s worse than me.” “Alas, we may strive for omniscience, but that is somewhat more problematic.” “I hear Roddy use some other ganders to survey Lake Othrys. Algae or some such.” “Yes, so I hear you talk. But that ’s not to mind maybe you didn’t want that to happen, what with you and all.” Doublewide – his hands , turn his wrists and pat pat pat with his eyes and flippers. “Oh, yes! The lower reaches are like they can be a museum of gangsters murdered in the early days. But Mr. Sounder, to you, I’ve taken some advice to pick in that regard. No, not necessarily. Did you not specifically know that concrete facts of the time were not on the agenda?” “I took that as a metaphor.” “It was, it was. You need have no personal fear. But as it turns out, that is also literally true. The lake and lakes have no secrets together. Let ’s drain away,
