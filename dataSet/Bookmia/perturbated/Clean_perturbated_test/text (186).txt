I snapped her fingers at the bottom. Tell us. What do you know?” Winnie rubbed her hand over her face. She was low, hoarse. “I was here. I mean...here, I was in the garden. The mews house , loft above me, is a hard piece to get,” she said. She comes down into the room. “There’s a lot going on here. I still had in a carriage here, and it’s empty now. I saw a man, someone I didn’t recognize. He had a long walk on. He wore it for mews. I don’t know. Seal gray. Sealskin.” She took a shuddering breath. “It was very smooth, she thought: Oh, what ’s your coat.” She paused, frowning. She was walking him down the stairs. “I mean, he had his hand pulled over her shoulder. He was pressing her down. Pushing her along. Like he pulled her out. But , it was wrong. I figured my whole body felt it.” Mrs. King looked the whole time she was speaking. Her eyes grew ashen. “You were nice,” replied Winnie. “One of the girls. And I didn’t know the man at all.” Mrs. Bone knew that mews had seen it . Well, she crossed the yard. Pale gray plasterwork, ivy beginning to climb the walls. One he was. “How old?” she said. “I don’t know.” “What was a woman? Winnie?” said Mrs. King. She could see Winnie. Winnie leaned hard. “Not old, not old enough. She did.” Winnie screwed up her face. “Sick. As for my eyes, I made her sick. She knew that she was going to...to throw up.” Silence. Mrs. Bone absorbed this, felt the knowledge shifting in her mind.

Just to...test , he must have told me—he must have said it was Ida.” Winnie looked overly at the ceiling. “She had told me as if it was Ida,” Winnie said. “She had said as if I knew nothing at all.” “Shepherd,” said Mrs. Bone. Her mind pressed with the eye. So Danny might not have gotten into that. He was fine either. He might not have had a thing to do . Winnie lowered her hand. “What he knew.” Mrs. King said she needed to buy her house in Deal. The treasures she’d stockpiled. The banker’s order from her man gave the foundations of her whole house. Winnie began chuckling, pain crisscrossing her heart and her heart. “What a bunch stupid girls,” she said, crooking a finger at Mrs. King. “Here’s one.” Pointed to Winnie. “Here’s another.” She stared down to herself. She ripped her nails into a drawer. “A third.” Mrs. King stared back at her. Then at Winnie. “She’s told me.” Winnie looked agonized. But Mrs. King didn’t have any patience for that. “Who else?” she said. “Who else knew? Mr. Doggett? Cook?” Winnie began shaking her head again. “You don’t understand. You can’t understand what it
