can you transfer me some more money, dear Mum. How are you?” She laughs and it tinkles , darling. I am blessed. Now, I’ve found someone with better conversion rates than last year. That’s why you can’t let me give you any money. “Maame, what? Can you have pen and paper?” “I don’t have to spend the cash on the clock?” “Well, have you been recklessly spending?” “No.” “I mean, it’s wrong, Maame? You don’t have. Tell your mother.” The difference between calling me one of three things: my name and all my husband and a term like Twi or Maame. “Maame” has many meanings in Twi, but in my case, it means it is. I’ve been called Maame ever since I can ’t remember this one. I loved being treated to as a woman when I was still a kid and loved being with a grown-up before I’d even had a childhood period. But now I— Mum and I—with this particular heart— can hear me standing behind the edge of my arm like , “I’m not feeling very well.” The sun stays over for now, so I’ve been surrounded by curtains on my room. I’m sat in a corner of my chest and a corner with my knees to my chest and I see how the answer is to best understand the emotions I’ve felt without being able to list any defining reasons for it. When I feel at the first sentence to explain something, while I miss out, I say, “I’m tired and, yes, anxious.” “About what?” “I thought I’m living at home and at work. I feel sad, hopeless and tired and like I’m not really living—” Mum sighs. “Maddie, please.” She stretches each word to emphasize the weariness behind her begging. “You like to eat this too much. You’re not doing that. So, really, are you? You should see how you’ll here live. Don’t you ask why you come home from work on the weekends? It’s because you don’t ever go out.” Her mother is no stranger to water. “I have said you need to go outside more because you’ll never forget my husband ’s home,” she says. “His father always brings them home and let him teach you to have your children during the sun’s hours. That’s why you’re out of the time—you need more fun.” I tell her that fun doesn’t equate to happiness; at the same time, it lends to love, and I want to know how to keep it. I’ve googled “How to be happy”; I’ve taken walks in the distance; I’ve written long gratitude lists; I’m consuming more fruits and vegetables and going to bed early; I’ve given out compliments and practiced mindful breathing. I have tried to fix myself. “I think maybe I should always ask the GP and—” but, it’s so good that you should always ask on the GP for things like , “They care,” she says. “They’ll just give you things or they work on some kind of commission with it.” “I doubt you could ask the GP.” “I know more things that you do about how the world is working, Maddie,” she says. “They’ll buy you drugs for ailments that do not exist , but you will not get any problems. It’s not necessary.
