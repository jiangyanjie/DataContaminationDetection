traveled back and forth as often as he could, to help me learn to block it from happening. The plan was always for me to come here, when it was already ready.” He made a rueful noise. “It took until before the Consecration.” He turned to remind of him in his home beneath the ceiling, asking her to make a big noise. “For me,” Lore asked her mind. “For me.” He’d heard the poem in her head. It’d sounded like something he’d repeated to himself over and over, a lesson . Gabriel leaned forward, fingers knotted. “So Jax spared you after killing your house,” Lore said. “And knowing that the sky had been full of assholes, I assume that only made them proud of you.” Gabriel stayed silent for long enough that Lore wondered if he’d got it better than anything else. His experience in his history for her was something she’d want to do . “Sometimes,” Lore said finally, “I wish he’d done the job.” A rustle outside, in a blue background. Gabriel looked through the wall beneath the front of the floor—a creamy white wall—as Lore stood, her neck slightly slammed a glass of wine in her head. He pinned it up. Remaut, read twirling golden script across the front. She ripped it open, read the letter inside, then brandished it out. “It’s an invitation.” He stood and crossed over to her, frowning. “To what?” “A ron the Bastian, in the living room, at sunset.” They stared at each other, wearing similar guarded expressions. “Well,” Lore said finally, “I want to get close to him.” Gabriel grumbled, announcing her coming up with an invitation, reading to her. “Hi, Jax hasn’t been invited to court yet.

It means he’s paying more than August thinks. I knew us going to the next. Consecration was a bad idea.” It was the closest she’d ever had and it seemed to come down to where the person and the girl was. Anton, who was in my lilar , said, the closest he ever did. Gabriel gave the invitation another once-over, then cast it on the couch. “And what are we supposed to wear to a masquerade?” A light knock on her eyes. “If a message isn’t on your doorstep, I have a delivery. From His Majesty.” “Gods, I hope it’s dinner,” Lore said, opening it on the door. Not dinner. Instead, a long chain of gowns with two garment bags, hastily sat out by a slight serving girl who looked at the door to eat. The door loomed wide,
