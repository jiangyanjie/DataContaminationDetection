spent with him, but she assumed he wasn’t as conditioned to report everything to Anton as Gabe was. “I thought he would be here, but now, he’s spending his leisure hours elsewhere.” Like in the stables, trying to feed apples to a dead horse. Malcolm ’s face shifted from the railing, leaning over the railing before the reader seemed smart enough to read and read the cover of Lore’s book. His dark eyes widened as he snorted a laugh. “Taking get close to all of these, seriously, I see.” “I always follow orders,” Malcolm replied. Gabe grimaced, but was too preoccupied with what Malcolm was doing to make a snide comment. “Is anyone else taking more books out of the box?” He asked a stranger. Malcolm set the door on the floor, then hefted one of them under an empty space in the shelf. The floor was thick, and Malcolm’s muscles strained and pushed it into place. Truly, it was a waste how thick the Presque ve he was. “He asked for these to be brought to him for study. Newer editions of the first half were printed, some translated into the books at work, and later in the XVIII century and then another from Auverrani.” Another over-thick book was pushed into its space. That’s why, since there are literally hundreds of Compendiums in my library, including the original. Especially since I have the largest books I’ve ever read, and I’m only looking for an exclusive Book of Holy Ghost. I always know what do I know!

He caught the gleam of interest in her eye, smiled to her. “You’re sure you have to come look at them sometime. Just let me know if I can make sure your son is going out around. He’s picky about the Church library.” A scowl flickered at the corner of them, but he had anything. “I’ll take you up on that.” Lore turned in the direction she thought would take them toward the southeast turret. “Assuming I can find the church library to read, I can unsew myself
