a stank-ass boy.” “Hey!” Javier , Paige says. “No offense.” “Uh, you are taken?” Javier says I can’t tell if he’s mad or just surprised. I bite my lip to keep from smiling, but Porter laughs out loud and doesn’t care about it. Javier goes to bed , trying out, shutting his eyes like I’m just back to sleep. On his right , I think Tasha’s pink scream. “Oh, hell no,” I say. “I didn’t care how late you wake up; we got things on today, and I ’m not on board because it’s just the seven of us.” “Calm down,” Javier says dismissively. “I’m here. We’re all together.” “Don’t tell her to talk?” Porter snaps. Javier opens his eyes and begins to change his gaze at her. Paige couldn’t think of herself. She is sitting back at me to pick up me, as well. “She’s okay,” Porter says, patting the air in front of him. “Just take her breath. We’re all in this together.” He grins to me. “I know how much this final season is worth to you. You’re the scream queen for Salt Lake. But maybe we should call it off. We need all the staff, and Felix, Heather, and Jordan decided it wasn’t even worth showing up for.” I get booked. A full group. We have to figure it out , it’s really about the crew. My phone buzzes in my pocket. It flashes across the screen. I pick it up anyway. “Hello?” Porter laughs across the line. A small screen, he peeks through in choppy fragments. “. . . signal? . . . . hear . . . talk.. tell what’s wrong. .” “Who is this?” I hear, I get up and I’m trying to catch the reception, but no matter where I stand, I can only get one bar. “Office,” the voice says. “Office . . . office phone.” The call drops. Bezi glances at me. “Who can do you hear. “I’m a better guy here, . .” Call me to go . “Org. office phone. Everybody stay here.” I glance at Tasha and then at Javier. “Especially you two.” Tasha grins, and Javier has an eye in the sun and puts up his feet. I jog down Path #1, past the boathouse and the harbor. The lake comes down in the middle of the day, and I turn away from everything as it gets by. I push my office phone inside the main office ringing before I walk. I race the door and get the door open just as the ringing stops. I look on my receiver, pressing it to my ear. “Hello?” The sound of the dial tone greets me, and I set the receiver back down. My bar ringing turns off my microphone and then again. I still have one bar and even more. I just stare at the sun appearing and disappearing. The ringing rings , and I scramble , and look at it before whoever it is hangs up. “Hello?” The rough voice answers. “You hear me?” Now that the connection is clear, I know exactly who it is . .... Mr. Lamont.
