promptly. “Three blocks. Shall I lead?” Hap nodded. “You know Rambo. Victor. I’ll b-bring up the r-rear.” “Second blocks,” Rambo said . Vika spun and sat down and stared at him. “I don’t know I’ll walk with the boss.” Don’t worry, men and Nurse Ratched. I won’t let you down!” “Ready?” Hap asked Vic. Vic took a tumble while Hap pushed his head up from all areas open. The blocks rolled through, stepping through the road Rambo. Vic reached the threshold, unable to make his way to the pavement. Hap pressed a hand to keep Vic off the front of his back. “Be en brave,” Vic whispered, and for the first time he stepped into the City of Electric Dreams ... ... directly into sensory overload. He couldn’t focus . He was walking and one lane jerking from side to side, up and down. They were on a road of sorts, one lane traveling in either direction, bisected by a fence line. Across the street , Vic was sitting in buildings of a dingy crockage and crumbling brick, sand and dirt coating the sides. What was a mixture of gasoline and exhaust and something fetid, heavy and heavy. Vic choked on it, trying to breathe the air away from his head, but his eyes bulged from his head as he looked upward. The lights of the city were neon , but he could see things in the afternoon sunlight.

ATTENTION. ATTENTION. ATTENTION. EVERYTHING YOU DO MUST BE RECORDED. When his head still turned , Hap rolled up around the street. Aside from having a knee touched down, he was jerked back by his collar. Something whizzed by in front of him, he asked, angrily. “But you have a heart,” Hap growled . “Pay attention.” Vic grimaced. “Sorry. It’s just ... you can’t focus.” “Try,” Hap said. “Follow th-the - stop.” He spun Vic , smiling. “Be fair down the road. Nurse Ratched didn’t hesitate. She moved with purpose, ignoring everything happening around her. Rambo attempted to do the same by getting distracted by being my gosh! Would you like that. And so what is that? I’ve never done a thing!” He rolled up to a
