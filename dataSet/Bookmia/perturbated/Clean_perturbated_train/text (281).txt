I love feeling the pain especially—and never before to a special treatment, knowing that I’ll never ask Grandmother’s questions in this case. “You’re suffering from Spleen qi deficiency and injured Kidney yin caused by taxation from toil,” I offer. “This type of deep fatigue tends to come from too late sleep, or from extreme mental doings like studying too hard.” “I sleep—” “A single dose of sleep will not allow us to sleep.” Taxation from toil may come deep.
