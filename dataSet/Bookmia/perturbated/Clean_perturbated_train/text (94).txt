Please keep reading. “I know the truth about Mom’s time in Boston. She told her she couldn’t see us, threatened her by taking custody. All because she should follow her dream.” “I shouldn’t have done it, but we had a dream. So why did she have to abandon us? I tried my best, after all. You were happy as I told you to leave her right?” He gestured with his right hand and then let it fall on his lap.
