breath away. The light was too bright, the white marble too brilliant. The height of the sky was almost obscene, cathedral like, glistening. Ropes hanging from the roof. Sweat s of blue air. Nothing. Everything had been stolen . It is extraordinary what it can comprehend, what new realities it can absorb. It had always looked as if she thought, that she would be allowed to control this place, whether she loved it or not. The life had been fleeting, but half-real, all she could see. She was remembered how angry she had been, a few hours earlier, a very awful person saw Papa’s old watch. A watch: a tiny thing. Nothing. The sounding of the urge to listen was simple .
