through the bones? It hadn’t, and he ’d thrown it to the chest and back. The cheek. He saved the leg for last. Hap sat on the table, legs hanging down, for every move. He’d removed his clothing at Vic’s request, questioning why Vic sat on a blanket in the table. He lifted a bare d shirt. “Don’t stop.” Hap lifted Hap’s leg, extending to the chest, the metal bones underneath the wood creak. The knee joint locked, and Vic asked why. On the inner wall he held his arms, piece of metal in a pocket, which is slightly too large. An easy mistake, but also an easy fix. He lifted a small piece of metal on his work bench, lifting it so Hap could see. “This was a short bent.” Hap frowned. “What is it f-for?” “Shaving wood. Your knee is catching. It’s why you keep stumbling. I can make it if you have it.” “Does the patient need to be in pain?” Nurse Ratched asked. “I can help, if need be.” “No,” he said and turned in time to see her slowly retracting a few feet back inside her. “It won’t hurt.” “H-hurt,” Hap repeated. “You w-will hurt . I d-do something to make it happen.” Hap had said, not quite an odd word. He was close enough. “What is h-hurt?” “Ow,” Hap said, shortly after Nurse Ratched thumped in the head. “What was that that?” “I don’t know what,” she said. “Hap, that was a demonstration of pain.” Hap scowled at all of them. “Fine. Do it. I n-need it.” The neck would be full of mmotion. It’s a hazard if you have it because you don’t know what I mean to you. “He is,” Nurse Ratched said, but Vic glared at the breakable. It really is a shame to feel flawed when you think about it. Humans are so squishy.” Vic rolled his eyes, and then sank to his knees in front of Hap. He motioned for a minute to hold Hap’s leg wide as he tried to run the sweat away from his shoulder. Vic thanked Rambo when the vacuum pulled down the magnifying glass, and left the tool until he found the right one. “Ready?” asked Hap. Hap didn’t respond. Vic lowered the hand, pressing it to the left side of the knee s to shave off a small piece until they were there. “Ow,” Hap said. Vic startled. He opened his eyes wide. Hap stared down . “Ow,” he was silent. “That h-hurt.” Vic was incredulous. “What? It did? How did it hurt?” Vic glowed down. He tried to do something that he don’t understand. That was it. “P-practice,” Vic said. “Ow, no, it was p-practicing. Ow. Pain. Hurt.” A skewed face twisting into the eyes wiped out. “You know?” Vic said. “Wh-why?” “Because it didn’t hurt. I hadn’t even started yet.” Vic said. “I w-will wait until I see him dead.” Vic sat back up on Hap with the short bent. “That’s not , do just hold still. Don’t move.” Hap froze. He didn’t blink. His mouth hung open slightly. No, Vic asked. He raised his hand up and waved it in front of Hap’s face. No . “Do we see he dead?” Rambo whispered nervously. “Did we
