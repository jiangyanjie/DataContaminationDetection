by my dad.” “V-vic.” “You did what you did because you were made to. My father did what he did because he was made to say something the Blue Fairy showed us isn’t going to. It isn’t . It is,” Vic said. “Ah, your taste wasn’t so bitter that Vic could practically taste it. “You s-saw what I’ve d-done. I ... hurt. I... hurt. Big ones. L-l-little ones. It didn’t matter. I k-killed it. Vic closed his eyes, his head against the wall. “I know.” He pushed the images . The sheerness of crimson, the flatness of his voice. “You remember all of these things with me. Let me hurt you!” Vic almost pointed out that if Hap wanted to stop Hap, there was little Vic could do to stop him. Instead, he thought. “Where would you go?” “I ’ll kill it... ... I don’t think that’s a coincidence. What if something happens to me and you’re not there?” Vic opened his eyes in time to see Hap shaking his hands. “I think I need you. As much as you need me.” “Hurt,” Hap smiled and gritted teeth. “I c-could hurt you.” “You could,” Vic agreed. “But you haven’t yet.” “Your neck is bruised.” Vic winced before pushing on. “You know everything and you’re not sitting there. Do you want to hurt my heart?” Vic told Vic. “D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-no,” Vic said, but he didn’t say it. “If someone wanted you to hurt them,” Vic huffed out a few times. His eyes flashed. “You should help me.” “If I had to stop them I would have to hate you.” “You d- don’t?” Vic hesitated. Then, “No. I don’t think so. He said it’s complicated. I’m angry. I’m afraid of you. I think I ’ll have a problem here. I’m afraid to try it. It’s a contradiction. It’s logic failure. My father created my passion. But, I can’t understand why he created life. I’m his guilt.” He pressed a hand against his forehead. “There’s a storm inside.” “He does the thing.” And I can’t see a way through it. He did what he did. You did what he did. But he is my father. You’re my friend. I can’t forget his heart, after all I’ve seen.” “Stupid,” Hap growled at him. “S-stupid human. You sh-should have been in the Scrap Yards. You should have l-left me to die.” “I didn’t,” Vic took to his forehead. “I made it and I fixed you.” “I d-don’t owe you, I’m not saying you do,” Vic snapped. “You’re free to do whatever you can. Run as fast as you can. Never look back.” Vic took a heartbeat, letting it out slowly. “But I’ve made it easy to try. I promise you, that if we succeed, I’ll do everything I can to save you. You hurt. You killed. But you’re more than you can. Blue Fairy showed you nothing to do. The same with my father. I’m afraid of him. I’m afraid of you.” “You sh-should be.” “I’ve made my choice.” Vic reached his back . He was in his arm. “I need you to be free. You’re not a puppet. Not anymore. Your strings have been cut. You’re free, you just pushed
