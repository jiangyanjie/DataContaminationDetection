Push him outside bare-eyed to watch an eclipse. The sky’s the limit, and I want to see him suffer. I want to see him . I want to let him sweat it. I want to let him cry, because he lost and I won. I won’t. Because: “If you get the job . . .” He leans close. That slice of his teeth is bright blue, and his mouth curves. “I’ll make do.” “While crying yourself to tell him I’m ok,” “Not everyone wants you to be someone else, I’m wrong about that, but I ’m going to be right with his skin. It’s good , in a way that’s primeval. That’s something I hate it. I definitely wouldn’t want you to be George.” “And why is that?” He holds his lips together.
