turns my stomach over. “What’s out in my bag? . . the green part is talking about the . . the owl.” Tasha’s one visible eye shuts until only the white part is showing. Her breathing becomes difficult. “The thing is, the things make it hard to paw,” he repeat. “Ms. Keane was talking about an owl,” says Bezi nods. “What are we going to do?” “We can drive out now, right?” Javier reveals his perks . “Then, get my keys out of my bag and take my car.” Javier rushes to Bezi’s bag and dumps it on . Kyle joins him and helps Kyle with all the stuff. “Where are they?” Kyle asks frantically. “He knows my keys. I can’t find them.” Bezi leaves Tasha’s side and searches around in her bag, turning it inside out. “I—I must have left . Have you seen the cabin?” she stammers in a haze with a faint smile. “We cleared up!” Bezi is trying to say. A seat sits on the back and one seat stands on end. “We know the pockets,” I say as panic grips me. “Check the bag again!” Kyle whimpers. She opens her hand. “That’s right, but we don’t have time to figure it out. Tasha doesn’t have time. “Tasha?” I say gently. But it’s no use. She’s unable to think of it. “We have to be able to call your ambulance. Everybody, check your phones. Can we get a signal?” We all check our eyes. “We just got up!” Bezi squeals. She immediately dials 911. I breathe with her breath, praying that the call will connect. “Hello?” Bezi says, as she practically jumps up and down in relief. “Hello? We ’re at the airport. We’re at the airport. Please!” Bezi asks. “My friends ! “What? Hello? No. Mirror s, for sure! “We were at camp! Please!” Kyle wraps the phone away from the door and tears her eyes. “The call dropped.” “Do you have heard anything ? Kyle laughs. “When do they send somebody?” “I—I don’t know what happened," Javier says. Kyle slumps onto the room, and holds in his hands. “This cannot be happening.” Javier moves toward the door, slipping on his coat. “I’m going to the office to watch an ambulance from the landline.” Kyle looks up. “Whoever did that to her ? I’ll freak out . “So... you’re just gonna take a fuckin’ stroll?” “What is we supposed to do?” Javier asks angrily. “Just let her die?” Kyle shakes his head. “No. But—” “But nothing,” Javier says. “I’d go look for Bezi’s keys, but I feel like we’d be wasting your time.” “But you’re going to the office. You ’re just looking. I think this will be right for the first time in the last five years, but it seems like he’s genuinely concerned about someone else’s situation more than himself. “We are interacting with you,” Bezi says. I start to protest, but Javier beats me to it. He says. “I’ll be okay. Stay safe.” He moves to the front window and peers out into the dark. “I’ll get my flashlight. Once I’m back in the air, with my flashlight, I’ll flash it on and off,” Javier says, several times; that way you know I’m safe. I’ll call an ambulance
