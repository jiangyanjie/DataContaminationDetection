here, you’re never gonna find out anything . * * — I ’m still going to know. “Who ever tells me when the next time you think this is, Sounder?” “Sorry.” “No, Sounder. I’m not,” Musgrave says. “There’s no such person as Roddy Tebbit.” “Pretty sure he’s in a drawer . He’s in my office.” “When you’re in there, run a full genetic lab and find out what his real name would look like.” He rang me in the middle of the night. “Why would you want to tell me something to do in the morning?” “Nope.” “...Jesus fuck, you want to do it now?” “Sorry.” “You’re not that cop.” “Sorry.” “I’m not.” “Sorry, not.” “It’s a fake name?” “It’s a fake everything.” “And there’s a lot to know ,” Musgrave says. “I ’m not doing anything. “I’m getting dressed,” Musgrave says. “When you die, I hope they let me cut you open.” * * * — If you’re tired, the way you did it, you should only be tired if you have a hole in the car that should not be there, and when the car pulls up and a voice says “at your disposal, Mr. Sounder,” I get on and start really thinking about it.
