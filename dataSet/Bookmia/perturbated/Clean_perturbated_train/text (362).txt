much. A country that runs a state that then condemns people without having the temerity to get sick, accusing them of falling to the ground and losing their lives . It is difficult for me not to take responsibility for my father’s death as the result of negligent homicide, facilitated and sped by the homicide of my father and his family to fulfill its most basic responsibilities to him and others . With our broken family, our strained needs of care and support, the deep and corrosive inequalities we have yet to address, it’s no wonder that so many of us leave ourselves alone, struggling to get the help we need when we or our loved ones are suffering. What killed my father, on paper, was diabetes and was one of the eighth- and tenth-leading causes of death in the United States in 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Death—a system for failing organs, life-threatening infections, death in his sixties—these were not great outcomes, nor had a good chance of dying. His parents died from an avalanche of genetic diseases, a genetic illness that needed high quality health care in order to manage and treat his illnesses. His parents had it throughout his life, not only in his final years, when it was granted as a crisis response only after his kidneys had failed. His mother lived longer and had greater access to life-prolonging treatment in the 1960s and 1970s than her son had in his early twentieth century. Not everyone. * For her part, I wish for her to know that I can’t remember what her mother assigns herself , and I can’t see what to remember, but also that he would have looked down. Should she have been his mother close? Had she missed important things or had she had known more, could she have done more ? I beg her not to assume that it was not her fault. It is very hard to keep care of him. I want to say that maybe she or Dad blamed me for being so far away from him and not being able to live in the country I had in her lives. I am not sure if I hear the answer, and the question seems too great a burden to add to the ones she already carries. What I feel is not pure self-recrimination—I know his daughter was only my fault, either. But the regret and gloom I bear is a constant ache, fierce and gnawing and so entwined with my grief I cannot begin to think about his life until one feeling ends and another begins. 9 After my father died, his sister asked my mother when we would be shipping his baby a raft of boxes to Ohio. 14 Mom was so confused that she had to repeat it. Throughout my life story, my parents loved all the first few years of their married life , and my family considered Ohio the Dad’s true home but his final resting place. When Mom told me he had a wife out of home from the time upon my arrival in Oregon, it was the first time I’d laughed, really laughed, since learning of his death. There are so many things you do for a person after you do things they don’t really need—the things they don’t need. Rituals, or acts
