were looking for on their imperial tour?—and they don’t go down smoothly. Maoren looks as though he’s swallowed a lizard and it’s trying to back up his heart, but Dragon scheming didn’t work the way he’d hoped. “Go there, make it,” he says, refusing to call Meiling by her name or her title. “Remind her where this opportunity comes from. Make her see how important it is to the Yang family.” I don’t know what he hopes I’ll achieve, but he arranges for a palanquin ’s mock to bring me straightaway to Meiling’s home—openly, without any tricks or tricks to deceive his mother. When I visit her at Grace Tranquility Teas, Midwife , I’m already set in the slit of the tree. He tries to wrangle a new window with demanding customers. The beauty in Meiling’s good fortune has already been flowing out. The group is serving on an enticement to patrons who doubt that part of this family’s luck will rub off.
