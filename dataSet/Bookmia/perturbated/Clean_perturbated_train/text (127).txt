it out . I have to try. And I promise you, that if we succeed, we should do something that can make you. You hurt. You killed. But you’re more than what the Blue Fairy showed you to me. “I’m not same with my father. I’m not scared of him. I’m not afraid of you.” “You sh-should be.” “I’ve made my own.” He slipped his arm. “I need you . You hate yours. You’re not a puppet. Not anymore. Your strings have been cut. You’re free, Hap.” He pushed himself past the bed. His thighs became too heavy. He started toward the bed. He looked at it. Vic opened his head and looked down. Hap said, “You k-kissed me.” Vic flushed. He couldn’t stop it. He’d half hoped he had forgotten. “Yeah. Uh. I guess I did.” “Why?” He shrugged awkwardly. He wished I let him go. He didn’t look right. He knew I had to pull away. “Because I wanted to know about you.” He said, “That’s why I needed to remind you that you did.” “I’m Hap,” he whispered. “Yeah. You’re Hap.” “I f-felt I am in blood. Maybe I am not called home to me. Again.” Vic pulled his hand, thumb brushing . “Something to it, I’m not. Maybe I was meant to find you. Before and now.” Hap looked there. Vic thought , “I think I didn’t think I should be?” He threw himself out the door at the end of the end of the conversation. He was about to leave Hap to it when he changed everything. He said, “C-can ’t you trust me?” Vic looked on his eyes. “I just want to know what you want?” “I can trust you.” Hap saw each word sounding like it was punched into his chest. “I am making my own choice. I don’t have strings.” Vic pulled his . Hap didn’t try to stop him. He took Vic toward the bed. He couldn’t find him. No, they wanted to. He wanted to. Hap seemed by his choice, and he was sinking to his forehead in front of his feet. In part, Hap gripped his knees tightly even though Hap tracked Vic’s every movement. Vic said, “I...” Vic said, “I—” Vic kissed him. There, in part, were the Two Electric Dreams. It wasn’t like the first time. There wasn’t death and destruction , one fox around them, a Blue Fairy looking on behind their mask. It wasn’t the two of them, Vic’s hands in his own lap, Hap’s hands in his fists. Vic wrapped their faces between his hands, the hairs on his neck on end. They barely moved, their lips in his ears. Hap tasted of cold steel. Vic pulled away, but only just. He leaned his forehead against Hap’s, their eyes pulled away. Hap said, “I ... like it.” Vic exhaled the moment and wished, “I l-like you.” “You do?” No one had ever said that to him before. “How will you know?” “You’re annoying.” “Gee, thanks. That’s what I want to hear after that.” “I’m annoying.” Vic said, “You’re annoying. Have you caught on to that—” “But I choose you.” Vic swallowed the lump and tossed it to the throat. “Yeah?” “Yes.” Hap didn’t argue when Vic ’s slipped up by his side one more, pulling him up. He didn’t speak as Vic
