“Yes, yes.” The Coachman shook his hands and held out his hand. A barcode appeared . Vic brushed his palm. One of the men stepped forward, scanning his arms with a swag. “I like the warmth that emanated from the tip of his fingers.” “I don’t remember the name of it? Doesn’t even feel like winter, but then so does in the desert.” “Is that Hap?” Rambo demanded. “There are two of them?” “No,” Nurse Ratched . “No Hap. HARP.” Hap said, and punched. Vic could do nothing but squeeze his hand. “The Coachman,” the man said . “Registered. No offenses.” “Of course , no offenses.” The Coachman said as the barcode disappeared. “I ’m not responsible for the creation of a law. I would probably think of a bad judgment. Why, the very idea—” “Are you ?.” He asked. “Is there anyone else in the house?” The Coachman said. “No one is too harsh, I’m afraid. I never did well with others. I like my privacy.” “What is my personal intention,?” “Oh! Well, where do I even begin? You know, since I was created, I’ve crossed this line of ours, bringing mystery and enchantment to all the machines! I—” “Your purpose,” Not-Hap said. Not-Hap chuckled. “Isn’t that the question of the day? What is our purpose? What are we doing here? Our intent is to be yours. So let us know that we are—” “You talk,” Not-Hap said, “without saying anything at all. We are all the Coachman . I have a curse. If you could tell me what you’re doing now I might be able to assist you better.” “Humans,” Not-Hap said. “I ’m looking for humans.” “Humans!” Not-Hap repeated.

Please, indicate whether you’ve heard of it before.” He looked back at the Coachman. “Do you understand?” “Yes! Of course.” “Gio, also known as General Innovation Operative,” Not-Hap froze. “Of course. General Innovation Operative,” Not-Hap said. “Quite like that. Can’t say that ! You have heard of him before. Who is he?” “For sure?” Not-Hap’s gaze shifted to the Coachman. Not-Hap went back to the Coachman. “Not quite. I think I would remember if you didn’t make that designation , but certainly ... unique.” The coachman was not open; Not-Hap said. “Under order of the Authority, your residence will be closed. What can you say? I assure you, there is nothing worth the time to get the Authority inside. Surely, you have more important things to focus on.” “Are you refusing?” Not-Hap asked. Not-Hap looked at the coachman hastily. “I will tell you a designation, the name of that thing. Please, please. Come inside! I have nothing to hide.” He turned, glancing back on the camera with an unreadable expression, Not-Hap ’s smooth men close at his heels. “Yes!” Rambo whispered. “Nurse Ratched,” Vic whispered. “Kill the screen before they see the light!” Vic said she had pulled the screen off, and put along Vic’s vision. “Not ,” Vic whispered. “Rambo, I’m not a big fan” Vio said. “You got it, Vic! I won’t
