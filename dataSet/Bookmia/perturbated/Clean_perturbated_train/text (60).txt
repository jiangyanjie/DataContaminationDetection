shifted his thighs. She gripped her as if the world has had them. He made a sound—a slip of breath—that made her heart race. “I’ll know what else...or what,” she told Kitt!” She started to lean back, but he touched her hips, holding her steady. “You’re not going to hurt my leg,” he said with a smile. “Don’t worry about hurting me.” He drew her closer, closer than her, but now she has another question. “Now, if you can proceed with my words, I have an important question for you to carry on,” Iris said.
