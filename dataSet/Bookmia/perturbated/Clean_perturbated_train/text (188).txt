But before some of Marion’s skates slid out toward the house, and as she wobbled, Judy grasped her hand and watched as she go. “I see you walking by the house every few days,” said Judy. “Sometimes I think Dad should just adopt him as his son and partner with. He likes Nathaniel way too, so dad isn’t going to give me. They can cut me out the box altogether.” “Do you want to marry ?” Marion hadn’t ever been asked this by anyone; the wedding had simply been given. “I don’t want him to be married,” Marion replied. “I think you could do better.” She hadn’t even considered that Judy might have an opinion on the matter. Never mind such a strong one. “I really think you’re married,” rose. “What’s wrong with him? He’s kind and happy, and we know his family well.” “You don’t mention love at all. I mean, I don’t have much experience, but I would think that comes first.” “You’re right. You don’t know.” Marion regretted snapping at her as soon as her words came out of her mouth. “Sorry.
