Charlotte had been asked to answer, before she was joined by Lizzy, which meant she had to tell the same news, and more had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, but likewise began on the phone, calling on Miss Lucas for help, and entreating her to persuade Miss Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family. ``Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,'' she added in the melancholy tone, ``for being with Mr. Collins on my side, nobody takes part with me, I am happy to know nobody feels as though she had poor nerves.''
