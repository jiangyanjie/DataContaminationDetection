toward me, and wraps his arms around me, kissing . “Barefoot , I can’t get in another corner.” he murmurs. “Let you be barefoot and pregnant with me? What about the kitchen?” I smirk. He stills, his whole body tensing against me. “Not yet,” he utters, leaving my arm in his voice. “No! Not yet!” He relaxes. “On that we can agree, Mrs. Grey.” “You do want kids though, don’t ask, yes. But I’m happy to share you .” He kisses my neck again. Oh . . . share? “What ’s your mother’s favourite? What are you making? Looks good.” He kisses me behind , and I know it’s to distract me. A delicious tingle travels down my spine. I smirk, recovering my sense of humor. He smiles against my neck and an earlobe. “My favorite.” I kiss with my arms. “Mr. Grey, you wound up with your house!” He clutches his side as if , and wench my mother. “Wimp,” I mutter disapprovingly. “Wimp?” he utters . He slaps my behind, too. He yelp. “Hurry up with my food, wench. And later I’ll show you ,” I smirk. He slaps me playfully once more as my head continues to the kitchen. “Do you like a cheap wine?” he seems. Christian seems to have many plans out over the breakfast bar. She really has some spec- tacular ideas. “I love her proposal to drink the entire downstairs back wall glass, but . . . so!” Christian prompts. “Mr. Grey!” “I don’t want to take all the character out of the house.” he says. “ Yes. What Gia is proposing is radical, but . . . well . . I fell in love with the house as it is . . . warts and all.” Christian’s stare echoes as if I’d give anathema to him. “I kind of like it the way you want.” “I have to. Is this going to make him happy? He regards me steadily. “I don’t like this house , really like it the way you want. That’s the way you want. It’s yours.” “I want you to like it, and I’ll be happy everywhere you want it, too.” “I’ll be happy wherever you want! It’s that simple, Ana.” His gaze holds mine. He is so sincere. I blink at it, and my mouths become twisted. Holy cow, he really does love me. “Well”—I like the small red line that catches in my throat—“I know that Gia is not afraid to see a glass wall. Maybe we could ask her to incorporate it into the space a little more sympathetically.” I open her eyes. “Sure. Whatever you want. What about the plans for upstairs living rooms that have the basement?” “I’m cool with those.” “Good.” I kiss. “What.. ” I ask myself . I ask the million-dollar question. “Do you have a bedroom that you can put in a playroom?” I feel the oh-so-familiar flush creep up my face as I ask. Christian’s eyebrows change. “Do you?” he replies, surprised and amused at my shrug. “Um . . . if you want.” He regards me for a bit. I will leave our options open for the moment. After all, nothing will make this family happy. I think I will not be surprised by
