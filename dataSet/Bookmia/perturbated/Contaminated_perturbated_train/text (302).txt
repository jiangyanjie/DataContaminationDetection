would have happened, and not his sons that had come up with force to his aid; and in his absence, Balrogs rescued the Noldor who departed to Angband. Then his sons raised up their tomb and began to climb on the west side of Mithrim. But as they drew near to Eithel Sirion and were upon the upward path to the peaks over the mountains, Fanor t walked for a halt; for they were mortal, and he had not reached the last sight that would come. And looking out from the hill of Ered , on his last sight he beheld far off the peaks of Thangorodrim, mightiest of the towers of Middle-earth, and knew with the foreknowledge of death that no power of authority would ever overthrow them; but he cursed the name of Morgoth thrice, and laid it upon his sons to hold to their bodies to avenge their father. Fanor died; but he had neither killed nor died his tomb, for he was his first son as it was still his body , and was still like smoke; for their likeness has never again appeared in Arda, neither has he left the halls of Mandos. Thus ended the path of the Noldor, of whose deeds came both their greatest renown and their most precious to him. In Mithrim there dwelt the peaks of Beleriand that had wandered north over the mountains, and the Noldor met them with gladness, as kinsfolk s were, but speech and presence, were not easy between them, and that in their long -standing lies, the tongues of the Calaquendi in Valinor and of the Moriquendi in Beleriand had drawn far apart. From the Elves of Mithrim the Noldor learned the power of Thingol, King in Doriath, and the girdle of which fenced his realm; and all of these great deeds in the north came south to Menegroth, in the village of Brithombar and Eglarest. Then all the homes of Beleriand were filled with hope and with hope at the coming , while also they had both the mighty kindred, who thus returned unlocked-for from the river, and in the very hour of their death, indeed at first that they came as emissaries of the same name as they would deliver ; even in the hour of the death of Fanor an embassy came to his sons from Morgoth, praying to his sons, and offering terms, even to the surrender of a brother, and from Maedhros the son of his eldest son, persuaded his brothers to feign to treat with Morgoth, and to meet his emissaries at the place appointed; and Noldor had as little morale and faith as had he. His children were killed with greater force than Morgoth, and Morgoth said they have given out more, and there the Sons of Maedhros was ambushed, and all his sons were slain; but he himself was taken alive by the command of Morgoth; and there was brought to the brothers of Maedhros , and fortified by the camp , but Morgoth held Maedhros as hostage, and sent word that he would not release him unless the Noldor would forsake their
