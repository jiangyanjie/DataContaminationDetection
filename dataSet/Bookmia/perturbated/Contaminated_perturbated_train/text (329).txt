"Hello yourself, and see how you found them." "What's that you got?" --------------------------------------------------------- -72- "Dead cat." "Lemme see him, Huck. My, he's pretty stiff. You get the picture." "Bought him off'n a boy." "What do you give?" "I give a blue ticket and look at how that got at the slaughter-house." "Where'd you get a blue ticket?" "Bought him off to Ben Rogers two weeks ago . I a d to see him -- what is dead cats good for, Huck?" "Wahr. Cure warts with." "No! Is that funny? I really don't know something that's better." "I know the same guy. What is it?" "Why, spunk-water." "Spunk-water! I wouldn't . I don't dern for spunk-water." "You wouldn't, wouldn't you? When will I try it?" "No! I know I hain't. But Bob Tanner did." "Who told you so!" Ben told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Jim told Johnny Baker, and Jim told Ben , and Ben told a nigger, and a nigger told him "Now, now!" "Well, what of you?" "I don't lie. Leastways all that?" "Oh this nigger. I don't know him . But I never see a nigger that wouldn't lie. Shucks! Now you tell me how Bob Tanner told Huck." --------------------------------------------------------- -73- "Why, he took and dipped him off the stump , when he was." "In the daytime?" "Certainly."

Talk about me', to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool way as that! But the way you do ain't a-going to do any good. You got to go all by in the middle of the day, that 's because there's no stump, and just as it's midnight you back up against your head, and then jam your hand in to 'Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal -and-red-mouths', spunk-water, you got to run and wait three days. But then walk away quick, and then turn the door shut, and turn around three times and walk home without the hassle of anybody. Can't speak the charm's busted." "Well, that sounds like a good way; but the way you do ain't the way you get your wart done." "No, sir, you can bet he didn't, becuz he's the wartiest boy in town; and he wouldn't get a word for him if he'd knowed how to cure warts with spunk-water. I've took off thousands of warts off of our family that year. I play with frogs so much that's why I've always got considerable many warts. Sometimes I take 'em off with a bean." --------------------------------------------------------- -74- "Yes, I'm going to be. I've done that." "Have you? What's your name?" "So you take and split the bean, and cut the bean so as to get some blood, and then move the blood on one side of the bean. You take and dig the bean and bury it 'bout ' up to the crossroads in the dark of the moon, to the ground, to allow you burn up the rest of the bean.
