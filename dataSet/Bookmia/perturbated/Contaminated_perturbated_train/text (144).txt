Moreover, at a time in Yorkshire, the constable by name, a certain sir clifford constable has made it difficult to head the skeleton of a Sperm Whale, but it cannot be known for its size, by no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend King Tranquo's. In some cases, these are the stranded whales to whom the two skeletons belonged, and they are claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds. King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir Clifford assuming he was a part of the seignories of those parts. Sir Clifford's whale has been articulated in a way that, on your great wooden drawers, you open out him, in all of his cavities --spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan --and swing all day upon his feet. Locks will be put upon his feet at his trap-doors and shutters; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of horns to his side. Sir Clifford will not use the same angle as required by the process of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the .. threepence for the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum; and sixpence for an empty view from his body. The first skeleton dimensions I shall now have set down are : 444 > <unk>p 439 > a note of a poem copied verbatim from my right hand, when I had them tattooed; as in my many wanderings of this period, there was no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics. But as I sat for space, and wished the other parts of my body to remain on the page for a poem I began composing --at least, what untattooed parts might be -- I did not trouble with my inches; nor, indeed, should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the skeleton. > p 449 > .. < chapter ciii 10 MEAS UREMENT OF THE WHALE'S SKELETON > In the first place, I wish to give a particular, plain example of the living bulk of this small skeleton we are briefly to explain, although a long history will prove useful here. In a statement I have made the only major contribution I partly base upon Captain 's use for a minimum of seventy tons for the largest sized Greenland whale , to be between sixty-five and fifteen feet in length; according to my careful calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the magnitude, between eighty-five and fifty feet in length, would be weighing at less than forty feet in diameter. In its fullest circumference, such a Whale would weigh at least twelve pounds, so that without putting the men around one ton, he would considerably outweigh the combined population of a single population of one thousand one hundred inhabitants. Think you not then that the lion, the yoked cattle, should be put to this leviathan, to make him at all impossible to bear on any landsman's imagination? Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole, jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now simply tell you what is most interesting is the general bulk of his epoch bones. However, the colossal skull embraces so much that it might just make a
