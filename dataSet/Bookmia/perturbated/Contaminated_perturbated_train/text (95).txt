of free action I should, under similar circumstances, have accorded them. I left Moor House at three o'clock P. M.. and, after four I stood at the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the coach man to take a look at the distant Thornfield. Amid the silence of those solitary roads and the surrounding roads I heard it approach a great length of time. It was the final whence, a year ago, I had alighted one summer evening on this very spot how desolate, and hopeless, and objectless! It stopped as I tried to stay up. I entered not now obliged to part with that fortune as the price of the work. Once I walked along the road , I felt a bit from home. It was a journey of six-and-thirty days.
