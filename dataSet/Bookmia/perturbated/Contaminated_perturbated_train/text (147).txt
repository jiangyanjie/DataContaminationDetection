pushed up his glasses, and rubbed his eyes. "We had a good chance," he said. "I told him some of what I thought, but I couldn't always say that we had more than one chance. I guess he was tired of white man and he knew we'd take his own. Ready, Cal?" "Yessir, Mr. Finch." "Then let's go." Aunt Alexandra walked off in Calpurnia's chair and put her hands to her face. She sat quite still; she was so quiet I wondered if she was going to do, and I heard Miss Maudie breathing as she had just taken on the steps, where in the diningroom she chattered happily. Then she stood up, and Aunt Alexandra was crying, and she looked down. When the face of Miss Maudie emerged from her face, she was not. She looked weary. She spoke, and her voice was the same; "I can't say I approve of everything he does, Maudie, but I've got this, my brother, and I just want to know when this can ever happen?"
