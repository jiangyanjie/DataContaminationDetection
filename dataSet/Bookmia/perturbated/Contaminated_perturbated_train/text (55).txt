culture. Hayward ran up to the castle, and sat on the terrace that overlooked the village. It nestled in the mountains of St James. The countryside spread along the canal of Neckar with a keen sense of friendliness. The smoke from the sand went over it, a pale blue haze; and the tall , spires of the valley, and the hilly walls of this terrace in a pleasantly medieval air. There was a small water under it which warmed the heart. Hayward talked of _Richard Feverel_ and _Madame Bovary_, of Verlaine, Dante, and Matthew Arnold. In some days Fitzgerald's translation of Omar Khayyam was introduced to the elect, and Hayward repeated his work, to Philip. He was very fond of reciting poetry, his own and that of his own, which he did in a monotonous sing-song. By the time they reached home Philip's children Hayward was given enthusiastic admiration. They made a practice of the letter of the book every afternoon, and learned presently something of Hayward's poetry. Hayward was the author of a country judge, on whose death some time before he had inherited three children, and he died in December of this year. His record at Charterhouse , London, is brilliant : he went to Cambridge the Master of Philosophy in a couple of years, and went out of his way to the satisfaction he had possible by going into college. He prepared himself for a distinguished career. He was an inspiration. He also studied the law in the most intellectual circles: he lived with his family , and turned his well-shaped friends to Tennyson; he knew all the details of Shelley's treatment of Harriet; he dabbled in the history of the book (on the other hand, his rooms were covered in pictures by G. F. Watts, Burne-Jones, and Botticelli); and he wrote not without distinction verses and pessimistic character. His friends told one another that him became a man of excellent gifts, and he listened to them willingly , and prophesied his eminence , and over the course of time he became a poet on art . He came under the umbrella of Newman's _Apologia_; the picturesqueness of the Roman Catholic Church was only what was important to his career, and it was only the feat of his father's wrath (a plain, blunt man of narrow ideas, who read Macaulay) which prevented him from reading and 'discussing over.' When he only got a break from his friends , he looked for the world, but he shrugged his eyes and insinuated that he was not an expert of examiners. He made one feel that a man was ever so slightly vulgar. He described one of the vivas with tolerant humour; some fellow in the way of asking questions in their room; while the conversation was infinitely tedious, he looked out loud, and he noticed that he wore elastic-sided boots: it was grotesque and ridiculous; so he stepped on his mind and thought it was about the gothic beauty of the Chapel at King's. But he had already spent some delightful days in the church; he had given better dinners than anyone he knew; and the conversation in his rooms had been often memorable. He quoted to Philip the quoted author "_They had Herakleitus, they told me not to say I was dead_." And now, he related again the picturesque little anecdote
