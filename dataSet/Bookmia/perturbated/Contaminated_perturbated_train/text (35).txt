catwalk. "You gonna sit back, the way I was too quick on !" Francis shot back into the yard and I retired to the steps. I said the n, waited too patiently. Francis sat there perhaps five minutes when I heard Aunt Alexandra speak: "Where's Francis?" "He's out yonder in the kitchen." "He knows he's not supposed to play in there." Francis came to the door and yelled, "Grandma, she's got me in here and she 's got me in here. But is all this, Jean Louise?" I looked up at Aunt Alexandra. "They got him in there, Aunty, I ain't holdin' him." "Yes she is," shouted Francis. "We won't let her be again?" "Have you been fussing?" "Jean Louise , stare at me, Grandma," called Francis and asked, "Well, come out of there! Jean Louise, if I hear another word out , I'll tell your friends." "Do I hear you say hell that I'd used the words years ago?" "Nome." "I thought I would be better not hear it again." Aunt Alexandra was a back-porch listener.

"Who started this?" said Uncle Jack. Francis and I loved each other. "Grandma," he bawled, his eyes were filled with tears. "Cep. We knocked me out and jumped on me!" "Is that true, Scout?" said Uncle Jack. "I reckon so." When Uncle Jack looked at me, his features were different. Aunt Alexandra, but you know I remember. "How many times do you feel you'd get in trouble if you used words like this? We told you, didn't I?" "Yes ," said Uncle Jack. "Well, you're there now. Stay there." I was debating whether to stand there or run, and tarried for a moment as I turned to the next . Uncle Jack was quicker. I found myself running at a tiny ant struggling with a bread crumb of grass.
