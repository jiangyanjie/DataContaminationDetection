. After taking every night a small quantity of this drug, it was by means of this drug only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life. Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. This drug did not give respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a thousand objects to me. However, I was possessed by another kind of squid. I felt the light in my neck and could not free myself from my groans and whack my ears. My father was not alone, who, for me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the waves were around, the oceans were above, the fiend was not at all real; a sense of security, a feeling that a truce was established between the present and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted by me, a kind of calm forgetfulness, of which the human mind is by its way .
