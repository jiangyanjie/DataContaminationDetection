Were I aware of the tamer scenes of nature I might fear to encounter your feelings, or perhaps your ridicule; but many more could appear possible in the warm and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the ever- varied nature of nature; nor can I doubt but that my tale conveys a series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed." You may easily imagine why I was much reluctant to hear the offered narrative when I promised to endure that he should renew his grief and seek to fill a great recital for his misfortunes. I felt the greatest eagerness to hear the narrative, partly partly from an curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate it if it were in my power. I expressed these feelings in my answer.
