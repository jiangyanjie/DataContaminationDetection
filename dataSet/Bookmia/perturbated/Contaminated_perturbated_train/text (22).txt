was beautifully flushed out with a hat, and she held her hand to her forehead. "I had to go all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Watson," she said. "I had not even time to wear my hat. I must not stop, or I have forgotten me. I must say to the world how sorry I am about the stupid mistake I made in the moment that you were Sir Henry. I can't believe the words I said, which have no application whatever to you." "But I can't believe Miss Stapleton," replied I. "I have become Sir Henry's friend, and the question is a serious concern . Tell me why it was that you. I was so eager that Sir Henry should return to London." "A woman's smile, Dr. Watson. If you know me better you will understand that I cannot always give reasons for what I say or do." "Too often, I remember the thrill in your voice. I always look in your eyes.

You want to take him away from a place that has been fatal to his family. The world is wide. Why should he wish to live ? Why is it the place of danger?" "I do not. What is the place of danger? That is Sir Henry's nature. I fear that unless you if it gives me some more en tion than this , it would be harder to get him to move." "I cannot say anything if I do not know anything about him." I would ask you another question, Miss Stapleton. If you meant no more than this when you first spoke about what happened, why should you wish your brother to overhear what you said? There
