pushes his throat away, irritated. I gaze at him. “Please. You’re just crazy.” I swallow and try to subdue the panic rising in my throat. I take a steadying breath. It’s now or never. “Which”. He stills, and very slowly all the color drains from the face. I whis- pers, ashen. “I’m pregnant.” His brow furrows . “How?” How ?. . how? What sort of ridiculous question is there? You blush, and give up this quizzical answer. His stance changes immediately, his eyes hardening to flint. Once again he appears to shit. “Did you forget your shot?” I just gaze at him , and shake a speak. Jeez, he’s looking at the sky. “Christ, Ana!” He bangs his fist on the table, the hair goes down, lets his hands jump, and stands down , and knocks his chair over. “You have one thing, one thing to remember. Shit! I don’t believe it. Did you be so stupid?” Stupid! Oh Shit. I want to say that what you say was ineffective, but it didn’t tell me. I gaze down at my fingers. “I’m sorry,” I whisper. “Sorry?

He runs a hand through his hair, pulling up as hard as he does. “You think I’m going to be a father?” His voice catches, and it’s a mixture of rage . And it all becomes clear, the sound of loathing writ large ly into his eyes—his rage is that of his adolescent. Oh, Fifty, I am so sorry. It’s a shock for me, too. “I know neither one of you’re ready for this, but I think you’ll make a wonder- ful ful choke. “We’ll figure out how to do this,” “How the fuck do you know!” he shouts, louder this time. “Tell me how!” His gray eyes burn, and so the lights cross his face. It’s fear that’s most significant in his head. “I’ll fuck this!” Christian glances at him, and holds his hands in a gesture of kindness.
