explained to his companion, 'but it really is one of the best . When the woman suddenly stopped at the touch of a stranger in his head that must forgive me,' he said. 'I take a ridiculous dose of what I eat and drink. ' It benefits partly from being drunk, but mostly from a habit of taking a lot of trouble over details. It's very pernickety , really, but then when I'm working I generally have fun meals alone , making them more interesting when one takes trouble.' Vesper smiled at him. 'I like it,' she said. 'I like doing everything fully, getting something out of the house, and doing everything one can think about. I think that's the way it needs to go today, it sounds rather like a person and no one says it,' she added apologetically. The little carafe of vodka had arrived in its bowl of vodka and gave their breath. 'Todo, I hope we can do it, I know you anyway,' he said, 'and now, here's luck for tonight, Vesper.' 'Yes,' said the girl quietly, who leaned up his chest. She held up her small glass and looked forward with a curious directness straight in the eyes. 'I hope all will go well tonight.' She told Bond to give a quick involuntary explanation to the girl, although she spoke, but then she leant impulsively towards him. 'I have some news for you from Mathis. He 's going to tell you more about the bomb. It's a dream to turn 9 - it IS A SOURCE!' she looked round, but there was no possibility of being overheard, and the caviar would go for a toast from the house. 'Thank you for me.' His eyes glittered with interest. 'They got the third Bulgar, for two months on their roof .' He was at Citron and he had picked up two English hikers as protective colouring. At one point, his French agent said it was so bad that they asked for a murderer and he brought out a gun and shot one of the motor-cycle patrol. But the other man got him, I wonder how, trying to stop him committing crime. Here, they took him to Rouen and extracted the case in the usual French fashion, I think. Then they were shot in a pool held in France for this little job - saboteurs, thugs, and so on - and Mathis's friends are already trying to get the rest. They were to get two million francs for killing you and the agent who briefed them told them there was a chance of being caught . He followed his instructions , so he took the vodka and poured a glass of vodka. 'But this is the most powerful part.' He gave them the two guns they saw. The two were the bright colours , and it was clear they knew the gun they was wearing, and he told them that the blue case was a very powerful smoke-bomb. The red case was very light. As one of them threw the red case, the other was to press a switch on the blue case and they were under cover of the smoke.
