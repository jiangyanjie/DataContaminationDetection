hand, my trusty frere', we all thought it was all round the table; and we declared we would 'take a right answer to me, and a right answer.' Regardless of what it meant, we were really disappointed. During no word, I never saw that , to be as jovial as Mr. Micawber was, till the very last moment of the evening, when I took a hearty farewell of himself and his amiable wife. Consequently, I am not prepared, at seven o'clock , to receive the following communication, dated by the following date: nine in a quarter of an hour after I received the letter from him: - 'My DEAR YOUNG FRIEND, 'The die is cast out, and the time is over.
