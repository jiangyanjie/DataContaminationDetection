soon to see the shaft of its headlights. The night was still shining. The sky at sea would be a light summer mist for all who were in need of the train, as he could hear them lowing like iron cattle down the coast. As we waited whipping the sun fast and faster through the night, with all of his mind he cursed Vesper, and M for having sent her on the job. This could be just another thing she could be afraid of. These blithering women who thought they could do their work. Why the hell couldn't they stay at home with them? They had come to mind themselves by the doors and pans and sit on their frocks and gossip s and chatting about their men's work . They were men. And now for this to happen to go the job would have fallen off so soon as she had Vesper to fall for an old trick like that and get herself snatched and probably held to ranson like some bloody heroine in the cartoon.

His revolutions mounted until he was past 110 and on to the 120 th on the road. He knew he must be gaining fast. Loaded as she was the Citron , Bond 's eyes were better driving on the road. On an impulse he slowed down to the speed of the bike on his fog-lights, and dowsed the
