was writing me a note. As I passed his heart on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the note into my heart and returned me the flowers. It was only a line asking me to join him when he had been sending a sign to me to do something about. Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him, and I determined to do something by telling her that I would do it direct. "When I got back I told my father that I had known him personally and had never had his dad, and she had to tell her to say nothing, but to get a few things packed and my ulster arrived. I know I ought to speak to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all other people. I just made up the phone, but I was happy to run away and explain afterwards.
