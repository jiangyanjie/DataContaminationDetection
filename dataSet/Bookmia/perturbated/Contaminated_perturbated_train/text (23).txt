how you be ," said I. "Ecod," replied I. "But his name is not my trade." "I just am in my trading-place," said I. "He is right," he returned. "You hit the nail on the head. Mr. Smith, I'm not my trader; you put on my considering-cap, and I think all you want to do, may be done ." Miss Skiffins (now my brother) is an accountant and agent. I'll look him up and go to work for you, and thank you a lot at times." "On this occasion," said he, "I thank you, for though we are strictly in our private and personal capacity, still we will be going into this mess.
