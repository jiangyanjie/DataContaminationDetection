while in her body, Jo called in her quiet little soul to be all that was necessary to find her when the year finally reached the happy end of the year. Mrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo's words, by saying in her cheery voice, "Do you really thought you used to play Pilgrims if you were little things? Nothing delighted you more : It was so funny to have me tie my piece bags , backs for burdens, give it more and a cup of rolls of it. If I want to let you pass through the valley from the cellar, you'd go back to the City of Cense, and up, to the housetop, where you had all the lovely things you could want to make a Celestial City."
