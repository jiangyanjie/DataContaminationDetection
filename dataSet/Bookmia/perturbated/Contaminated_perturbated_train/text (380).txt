the times with it. I was a little too afraid and spelled out, and my tears, which might not spare me, vividly returned. But they returned and I put their gentle tone upon them that softened even the edge of darkness. For now, the breath of water and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it would be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be my mother who, of course, was just as bad as they thought of me. At this moment I was in sight of the house, and saw that Trabb , who had put in a funereal execution and taken possession. Two dismally absurd persons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch and elves in a black bandage - as any instrument which would communicate any kind of emotion to anybody - were posted , and all I thought of was in the front door; and every morning of them I recognized a postboy discharged from the house for turning a young couple into an son on their bridal morning, in consequence , of his rendering it very sad for him to see his horse clasped round the neck with both arms.
