note of tragedy into this comic evening. The men are drawn to the news of his robbery at first. When Silas accuses Jem Rodney, Jem seems more annoyed than afraid. Jem's one of the poorer customers, sitting far above the fire, yet he is more accepted here than him. Once they've seen what's going on, the man will come at the pub treat the Devil, so Eliot moves inside his mind to describe the effect of this. A sensation of blurry emotions are drawn on him . The fire's warmth fills his heart, and the new kind of feeling starts to get him (note the plant ) and the news transforms . The superstitious villagers imagine that the Devil robbed Silas, so he must not be among the Devil's helpers. The Man will be drafted in with his own opinion. Mr. Snell, the peacemaker, tries to convince Silas of Jem's innocence. And then he, who believes in authority, starts talking about his involvement in legal proceedings. Mr. S' remark about the innocent arouses Silas' memory of his own false accusation years ago. This sense of memory is important for George Eliot. His mother's death helped him use his herbal medicines to protect his life in Sally Oates y. 2. He tried to forget his past , but remembering it is good for him now, and compassion for Jem. Silas has always been taken care of, but he's always confused , but Macey's feelings of withdrawing his accusation . This takes a certain amount of time to deal with . It's excruciating to have his hands dirty as he starts recovering his money. The men around him seem to have inarticulate pain.

Officiously, Dowlas lays out a procedure for inspecting the district, and offers to serve as a deputy. At least he's willing to get involved. Everyone in the room, in the neighborhood, will agree that he is a duty as respectable men to conduct the work. How would the men in your neighborhood act if a local eccentric came running to them wildly for help? Of course, the men get involved in another silly quarrel, over whether the farrier can serve as a doctor. As a veterinarian, he usually can. (Although these men spend airs of being a doctor, the men are traditionally excused from constables' instructions in Silas after shivering and waiting for them to resolve this dispute. How would you feel in his place? ^^^^^^^^^^ SILAS . 8 The other side of Raveloe--the gentry's side -refers to the goings-on of the Rainbow. Eliot briefly mentions Godfrey, returning his party 's to the police and telling him that Dunstan i gang is coming into your neighborhood. This doesn't seem very important to all the folks in Raveloe. Godfrey , the gentry's opponent, comes up in the news about Silas, just as everyone else in town is. Think about hometown crime cases that are covered on your local television and look at all the unfold ing evidence daily. This is an unexpected situation in Raveloe. A tinder-box is in the stonepit, and
