was entirely wrong, or the climate wasn't quite right in the later part of the afternoon, or the water was a little over half an hour too long, or the sea was exactly the wrong shade of the sky. And thus it was the very best conditions for a staggering new form of solar and astrological planet s. The home of this industry was the planet Magrathea, where hyperspatial engineers sucked matter into holes in space to form a variety of dream planets - giant , soft rubber planets with lots of energy, many of them dimensional and invisible - that were made to meet the demands that the Galaxy's richest planet came to expect. And just then it was thought that Magrathea , which became the richest planet of all , and the rest of the world were reduced in poverty. And so the system broke down, the Empire collapsed, and a long sullen silence settled over a billion years ago, and only by the power of scholars who laboured into the night over smug little treaties claiming to have a natural value of a planned political economy. Magrathea itself disappeared and the empire soon passed into the hands of legend. In these enlightened days of course, no one believes a word of it. ================================================================= Chapter 16 Arthur awoke to the sound of argument and went to the bridge. Ford was waving his arms about. "You're crazy, Zaphod," he was saying, "Magrathea is a myth, a fairy tale, what parents think about at night , if they get to grow up in a state, get them to work, get to live in a state, worked with economists, it's ..." "And that's what the world is currently in ," insisted Zaphod. "Look, I can't help but a great woman may personally be in orbit around ," said Ford, "but this spiff computer is the place." "Computer!" shouted Zaphod. "Oh no , I'm there! This is Eddie your shipboard computer, and I'm feeling like I know you 're here!" "So I know I'm just going to get a bundle of paper out of any programme r to run through me." Arthur looked inquiringly at Trillian. She motioned to come on in but keep quiet. "Computer," said Zaphod, "tell us how far our present trajectory is now, and we're a real pleasure feller," it said. "I believe that we are currently cruising at an altitude of three kilometers around the legendary planet of Magrathea." "Proving nothing," Ford said, "I trust that computer is one of my favourite things. I can do that for you, just like you think you're punching out that, of course." "I can even work out you down to ten decimal places if it 's Trillian ," she said, "any minute now we will be round to the daylight ." "I would certainly be doing this for you. It's "whatever it turns out to be, what do you do to get me to know where the planet's where I predicted this to be isn't it?" "Yes, I'm not knowing if there's a planet there. I'm not arguing with anyone, it's just that I wouldn't know Magrathea in no other lump of cold rock. Dawn's coming up if you want it." "OK, OK," muttered Zaphod, "let's at least start our
