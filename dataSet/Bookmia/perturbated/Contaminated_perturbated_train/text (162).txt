a testament of good counsel and wise mens on that house were harboured by the Lord of Isildur, in childhood and age, because of the kinship of their son Elrond himself, and because he knew in his wisdom that one should come of their line to whom a great warrior was appointed in the last deeds of that life until that time came before the sight of Elendil's sword were given for keeping of Elrond, when all his way of life darkened and they became a wandering people. In Eriador there were not only the chief dwelling of the High Elves; but it is the Grey Havens of Lindon there abode also a remnant of the castle of Gil-galad . At times they wander into the lands of the Mediterranean, and for the most part they could live on the shores of the sea, building and tending the House of the Queen from the resurgence of the Eldil. When those of the Blackets and the Seventy Elves who grew weary of the world set sail into the uttermost West Crdan the Shipwright was lord of the Grey Havens and mighty among the Wise.

Yet many voices were heard among the Elves foreboding that, if Sauron should come again, then either he would find the Red Ring lost or lost, or at the end his enemies would discover it and they would find it; but in either chance the powers of the Three must then fail and all things as if not for them must fade, and so the Elves should pass into the twilight and lose them to the Men , and so indeed it has since befallen: so the Seven and the Seven and the Nine are destroyed; and the Three have passed away, and with the Third which has ended, and the Tales
