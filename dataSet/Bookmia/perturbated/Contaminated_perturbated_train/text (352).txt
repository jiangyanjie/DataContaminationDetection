a silver para- chute. My first gift from a sponsor! Haymitch must have had it sent in to me to see the anthem. The pot easily fits in the palm of my palm, without any need to make it out of my pocket. What can it be? This is not surely. I unscrew the lid . . by mistake that it’s medicine. Cautiously, I scratch the skin of my wrist. The throbbing in my fingertip vanish- the flame. “Thanks Haymitch,” I whisper. “Thank you.” He has also doned me. Not just my own medicine. I know how I’m getting to fend entirely for myself. The cost of this can be astronomical. One may not have seen it, but it was expensive. But you would like to buy this coffee pot. To me, it is priceless. I kept the fingers to the jar and place the balm over my calf. The effect is almost magical, leaving the pain on con- dation with a pleasant place behind. This is no herbal medicine – as it grinds up out of woodland plants, it’s high-tech medicine brewed up in the Capitol’s back yard. As my calf is treated, I rub the same layer into my hands. After getting the pot in the parachute, I firmly put it safely away in my pack. Now that my life has eased, it’s all I can do to repo- sition myself in my bag before I plunge into sleep. A bird perched just 12 inches from me alerts me to a new arrival of a new light. From the gray morning light, I examine my hands. The medicine has transformed all the angry red patches to pale pink and a bit of baby-skin pink. My leg still feels inflamed, but that is far deeper. I apply another coat of medicine and quietly pack up my gear. Whatever happens, I’m going to attempt to move and til myself. I also make it a cracker and a pot that takes me to thicken beef and drink tea cups . Almost nothing stayed in place yesterday, and I’m already starting to feel a sense of hunger. For me, I can see the boy and Peeta asleep on the ground. He stayed in her position, leaning up against the trunk of the tree. I guess Glimmer was supposed to be out but fatigue overcame her. My wife can get angry, even as they try to penetrate the tree next to me, but I can’t make out Rue. Since she tipped me off, it only appears to warn her. Besides, if I’m to die today, it’s all I want to win. Even if it means a little too much for me, the chance of Peeta being crowned victor is unbearable. I call Rue’s life with a hushed whisper and the eyes appear, wide and alert, at once. She points up and then drops on an empty nest again. I turn my knife and blow myself out in a sawing motion. He snoove and disap- pears. There’s no ice in a corner. I also keep the same sight of Glimmer getting a bit farther off. As she’s getting older, it’s about to migrate from tree to tree. It’s all I can do not listen to him out loud. Is this what she showed the Gamemakers?
