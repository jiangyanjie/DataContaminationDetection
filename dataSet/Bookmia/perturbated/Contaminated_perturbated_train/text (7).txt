and the men slowly turned from looking up river and were drawn on the fire, having nothing to say, perhaps as the sun coloured the backs and necks as they bent down. Granger unfolded an oilskin fried pan with the bacon under it. "We'll have a large frying pan, or we'll turn around and go out into the chimney. They'll be picking up that way." Someone produced a small frying-pan and the bacon sputter rolled into it and the frying-pan was set on the fire. After a few hours the bacon was brown, some would dance in the pan and the sputter of it filled the air with its own water. Two of the men watched this ritual silently. Granger looked back on the fire. "Phoenix." "What?" "There was a silly damn bird called the Phoenix." Granger sat with a young man called the Phoenix and came back before Christ: every few hours he built a pyre and burned himself down that must have been first cousin to Man. But every time he burnt himself up , burned himself from his ashes, he was born all over again. And it looks like he was doing the same over and over, but that's one damn thing the two man had. It's exactly the same thing we just did. We know all the damn silly things we've done for a thousand years. But as long as we know that and always look around where we can see it, some of those people stop making the goddam funeral pyres and jumping into the middle of them. We pick up a few people from every generation." He took the pan off the fire and let the bacon cool and they ate it, slowly, thoughtfully. "Now, let's get on there." Granger. "And thanks to one thought: You're not important. You're not anything. Some of the people of load we're not here for you. For a while there were some people who would help us to write them; even when we went through the books . This matter a long time ago, we understood what we got to write with them. We went right on insulting the dead . The plan to be with you and give them some credit. Well, I went right on spitting in the graves of all the ones who knew us. We're going to meet a lot of people in the next week and the next month and the next year. Once they ask us what we're doing, you can say, We're doing things. I know we'll win out in the long run. And some day we'll remember so much that we had the biggest goddam n in history and dig the biggest grave in history all the time and shove war with cover . Come on now, we're going to build a mirror-factory first and the large metal frame in our mirrors for the fire. "Another day and take a long look in the windows and finished eating and running the fire. We're brightening all about them as if a pink light had been given more wick. Like the birds of the trees, the birds that had flown away now came back and settled down. Montag ne had fallen back into the bed, fell into his bed and after a moment found that the others , the other birds came in behind him, going north.
