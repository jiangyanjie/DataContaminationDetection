the first time he got in. "Please don't -- I may be killed, either, but the widow's been good friends to me sometimes, and nothing is going on -- I will say you'll be saved, but you won't ever get murdered, or you was me." "By George, he has got something to show, even if he wouldn't act so!" HE heard the old man; "out with it and nobody here'll ever tell, lad." Three minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were up the hill, and just entering the sumach a, they had an attack on the tiptoe, their weapons in their hands. Huck accompanied them no further. He hid behind a great bowlder and fell to listening.
