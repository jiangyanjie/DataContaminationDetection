he 'd done anything to get to anybody. Just fishes a little, to keep up to get drunk on -- and loafs all together, but lord, we all do that . I hear most of his advice from --------------------------------------------------------- -218- preachers and such like. But he's kind of good -- he 'd half a fish, once, and warn't enough for two; and lots of times he's kind of stood by me when I was out of the world, and mended kites for me, and knitted hooks on to my line. I wish we could get him out of there." "My! Or you wanna get him out, Tom. And besides, there were many good; they'd ketch him again." "Yes -- so they would. But I hate to hear 'em say I did so like the dickens when he never done -- that." "I do , Lord, I hear 'em say he's the bloodiest man in this life; and they say I wasn't ever hung before."
