He listened belligerently up to M's Chief of Staff, a young sapper who had earned his place in the seat of Mr. K. Chikney 's Chief of Staff committee after having been wounded during a sabotage raid in 1944, and had kept his head under humour in spite of his experiences. 'Now , Bill. I want to sell his section to the Chief. Is this a good idea for a young person like Penny?' The Chief of Staff spoke to M's private secretary who shared the room with him. Miss Moneypenny would have been desirable as M the people in the room were cool and direct and quizzical. 'Should be all right.
