She went out into the garden as fast as possible, and the first thing she started doing was to run round and round around the flower garden ten times. Although Mary tried to use it several times carefully before she had finished she felt in better spirits. The sunshine made the whole place look different. The high, deep, blue sky came from Misselthwaite as well as over the moor, and she kept lifting her face and slipping up into it, trying to imagine what it would be like to pull down on one of the little snow-white clouds and freeze it. She went into the kitchen-garden and found Ben Weatherstaff working there with her grandmother. The change in the weather seemed to make him good.
