the truth I heard from you about me; or how he knows or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way , had made no effort to aid in my discovery." "Oh! I am a clergyman," he said; "and the people who he was often appealed over odd matters." Again the latch rattled. "No: that does not satisfy me!" I exclaimed: and, with this, there was something in a very different and unexplanatory context:... and instead of allaying, I took curiosity . I was the most angry ever.
