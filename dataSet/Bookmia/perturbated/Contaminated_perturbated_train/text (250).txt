"When I reflect, my friend and his wife knew," she, "on the rise of Justine Moritz, I had been forced to see the world and its works as things that appeared to come.‚Äù Before, I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice , and I read in books or heard from others about the ancient days or imaginary life; but at least they were brought up more with reason than to the imagination; but now misery has come home, and it would appear to me as a responsibility for each other's fate.
