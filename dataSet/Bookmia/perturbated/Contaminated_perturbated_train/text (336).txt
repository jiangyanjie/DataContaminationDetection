is , it is mine. How different are my minds? HOME, CHRIST, ALE, MASTER, on his lips and on mine! I cannot speak or write , nor speak without his spirit. His language, so familiar and so foreign, is the language that speaks most for me in my speech. I have not made or accepted . He holds them at bay. My soul frets with shadow s in the language. I cannot distinguish between sublime and the sublime, I have added, to distinguish between moral beauty and to choose between the sublime. And to decide what kind of beauty is proper to you as a result of the various arts. These are two interesting points we might take up. Stephen, disheartened suddenly by the dean's firm, dry voice, stopped silent; after the silence a distant , many boots and confused voices came up the staircase. --In pursuing these speculations, the dean , Stephen, is, in the danger of perishing of inanition.
