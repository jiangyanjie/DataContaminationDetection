At the moment when he had seen her fall on the bandaged floor he thought it had been as though she had been the one of them holding on to his own body. 'You're hurt?' he laughed as though his chest was broken. 'I'm all right. I'm all right. I have broken nothing. My arm. It'll just hit a stone in a second.' She spoke as though his arms were fluttering. She had certainly turned very pale. 'You haven't broken anything?' 'No, I'm all right. It 's a moment, that's all.'
