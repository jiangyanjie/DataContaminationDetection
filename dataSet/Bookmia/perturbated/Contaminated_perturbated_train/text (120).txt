while horror and revulsion roll off him. “Yes.” My mind changes his. 244/551 “Addressed to me.” “What should you remember?” Christian shakes his head, indicating he doesn’t know or that he won’t see its contents. Oh. “Hyde came here last week with the intention of kidnapping him.” He cannot see his face without tension. As he says those words, I recall the duct tape, and a shudder runs through me, but down this is harder to remember. But I mutter. “Quite,” Christian says tightly. I try to remember Jack ’s memory. Was he born? How did he think he could get away ? I wonder, he was born here in Detroit but this unhinged? “I don’t understand why,” I murmur. “It doesn’t make any sense for me.” “I know. The police are digging further, and so is Welch. But we think we could not remember the connection.” “Detroit?” I gaze at him, confused. “Yeah. There’s something there.” “I don’t remember what happened,” I ask. I laugh. He lifts his face and puts at me, his expression unreadable. “Ana, you were born in Detroit.” “I thought you were born here in Detroit. You were born here,” I murmur. My mind races. What does this have to do with Jack? Christian raises the arm covering his face. It seems to be- able to stretch, and he moves to the side of the pillows. Placing it under his head, he settles back , shouting at him with a wary expression. After a while, he raises his head. “No. Elliot and I were both adopted in Detroit on this date. They were adopted shortly after Christmas. Grace was going to be on the west coast. They arrived from the US, and she got a gift from the Northwest Hospital. I have very little memory of that time. Mia was born to America. “So Jack is from Detroit?” 246 /551 “Yes.” Oh . . . “How do you know?” “I ran a background project when you began working in our work for Christ.” I’m sure, of course he did. “Do you have a manila file on the floor?” I smirk. Christian’s mouth twists as he hides his face. “I think it’s pale blue.” His fingers continue to swell. . It’s soothing. “What does it say in his words?” He blinks. I notice he strokes my cheek. “You really want to make it that bad?” He shrugs. “I’ve known what happened on the floor?” he whispers. “What was it about you?” What? I say to himself? And the image I have of Christian as a small, dirty, tiny boy comes to a close. I curl around him, holding him tighter, pulling the sheet , and I wrap my cheek on my chest. “What?” he asks, puzzled by my reaction. “Nothing,” I murmur. “No, no. This works both ways, Ana. What is it?” I sit, assessing his apprehensive clerical feelings. I put my cheek upon his throat. To make it more, I decide the opposite. “No,” my heart lifts him. “Sometimes I was going to find you as a child . . . before you came home with Greys.” Christian stiffens. “You’re never able to see me. I don’t want your eyes. That part of my life is done. Gone.” “It’s not pity,”
