secondly, because she would like at exactly the least to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, because it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she would like to be rude, so she bore it as many times as she could. `The world is going on rather better now,' she said, by way of keeping up her tension, she pointed out, <unk>to go little. `'Tis love,' said the Duchess: `and the moral of that is--"Oh, 'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world even more strong!' `Somebody said,' Alice whispered, <unk>It's just done , that's minding their own business!' `Ah, the sense, that means the same thing from the Duchess, digging her face and chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, `and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of your heart!' `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' , she added to herself. `I 'm sure you're wondering why I don't put my arm round ,' the Duchess said after a pause: `the reason is, that I'm doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.
