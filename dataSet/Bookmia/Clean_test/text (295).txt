your car—and you believing her. This is Parker telling you the stolen math exam answers in our room were mine—and you believing her. This is Parker—bullying the hell out of poor, kindhearted Augusta Ross so viciously and so toxically that the girl ate a whole bottle of Tylenol and then telling the school administrators that it was me—and you, all of you, believing her!” I could hear my voice go off the rails. Starting to sound like Janis Joplin. Louder and screechier—as if volume or desperation or hysteria could get through to them. Though it certainly never had before. A new crowd of people was starting to gather around us. Lucinda glanced around at them uncomfortably. She lowered her voice. “Sadie, let’s all just try to move on.” Which made me want to bang my head against that brick wall. What did any of them think I was trying to do? “When did you text her?” I demanded of Lucinda then. “What?” “When did you text Parker to let her know that the show was happening after all?” Lucinda looked over at Parker, like Parker might hint at how to answer. “When!” I shouted. “About ten minutes ago,” Lucinda said.

Lucinda dropped her purse at the sound of it, and Augusta politely picked it up for her. “Augusta Ross?” Lucinda confirmed. “It’s so lucky I ran into you,” Augusta went on with determined brightness. “I’ve been wanting to reach out.” “Why,” Lucinda asked, “would you want to do that?” “And it’s so lucky that I arrived just when I did, don’t you think? Here I was, coming to see the art show of my dear old friend Sadie, and what should I hear as I walk up to the building but Sadie herself, shouting
