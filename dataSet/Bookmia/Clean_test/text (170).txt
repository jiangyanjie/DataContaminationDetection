all love Mick—I done went and created a place where—whatEVER you like, whatEVER you crave—you can, you can, YOU CAN GET…SATISFACTION!” There’s something happening on the stage level that I’ve never seen before. The tables are sliding apart and an object is rising up out of the floor. An enclosed metal frame four metres by four. Or, no. Not a frame. A cage. Oh, for fuck’s sake. Vic has one hand flung out over her head like a prophet. “Here at Victor’s we like to think we can make anything happen for you, make everyone happy…but dis-agree-ments. Do. Arise. “I love it when something tasty ARISES. Don’t you?” A fat wink, white teeth flashing. She only comes alive in front of the crowd. Vic was never a hooker. She was never a hitman either, whatever you may have heard. She never ran guns out of Lisbon and she never divorced a billionaire. She was a televangelist. It’s not even a secret, yet somehow no one knows but me. “AND TONIGHT…we have something a little special to whet your appetite. Oh YES WE DO.” The cage slides into place, and the door opens with a massive crash. “A DUEL! For the honour of—well now. I wonder. WHICH OF YOU WILL STEP INTO THE CAGE?” The spotlight picks out the heroes and they love it. She jumps on him, wraps her legs around his hips and drives her tongue into his mouth, then bucks off again and raises his hand in hers: “WE DO EVERYTHING…TOGETHER!” Vic throws back her head and lets out another mad laugh. “OF COURSE YOU DO! Ladies and gentlemen—and others more intriguingly complex! IN THE RED CORNER WE HAVE THE BOLD! THE GORGEOUS! THE MUSCULAR, SALTY AND DELICIOUS! THE AFFRONTED…” she leans down and listens “MAC AND MINI!” Laughter. “Well, that’s not their fault, they hardly knew they were coming out to fight this evening. They had something ENTIRELY different in mind…” she grabs the man by the ass in passing. Huge laughter from the room as Mac jolts upright, grinning in outrage. “AAAAND THAT’S THE STAKE! IF THEY WIN…THEY GET TO TAKE THEIR PLAYTHING HOME…IF THEY LOSE…” she stretches it out, staring at the couple, who have just realised there’s a downside in this for them and don’t like it. Too late to back out now. The room loves their loss of confidence. Vic leers, taking her hand off Mac’s ass to flick Mini’s armoured skirt up. “COMMUNITY SERVICE!” A roar of approval. She walks down towards the cage, the mic trailing its long tail behind her. “AND HERE HE IS…THE APPLE OF DISCORD! THE PRIVATE, THE PRUDISH, THE PRIGGISH OBJECT OF THEIR THWARTED AFFECTIONS…” And now the spotlight’s on me. The room’s laughing again. Vic nods, palm down. “I know! I know! He don’t look like much. But a girl wants what a girl wants. We all have URGES don’t we? Now myself…these days…cookies and a glass of milk. A good book…And two or three of my favourite lovers to warm eiderdown! But for now: what’s your name,
