one?” “Nante yiye.” “Let’s go now.” “The address. What’s the address?” “Kyerɛ me kwan no.” Twi and English are flying in the air. Heels on the pavement, engines revving, and car doors slamming. For a moment, I stand alone because if Dad were here, his would be the car I’d sit in. For years, wherever he went, by bus or by train, to the supermarket or the GP, I’d go with him, until I had to begin going instead of him. Aunt Abena gently pulls on my arm and tells me to get into the silver car. The man at the wheel is familiar, belonging to the group from Mum’s church, but I don’t know his name. He’s a friend of the family, or a family friend, or family but not blood-related, whichever one, it doesn’t matter. We pull away from the house and travel down the road. We’re the third car behind the procession. Every time the hearse turns a corner and I see the photograph of Dad, large and framed, sat at the end of his coffin, the tears resurface. People on the street turn to watch us. A dog barks. One old man makes the sign of the cross. When their eyes meet mine, my chest opens and I feel exposed. I hope I remember never to stare at a funeral procession as it passes ever again. * * * I’ve never been through a graveyard before; I used to avoid cemeteries because I worried it would tempt fate. Looks like fate found me anyway. The sun is hot and the ground is uneven. My black cotton dress feels too heavy when I watch the cemetery workers lower my dad into a burial plot. They talk amongst themselves as they work because this is their own personal brand of “just another day at the office.” People I didn’t greet at the house come up to me, but I don’t really see any of them. Hello, Uncle. How are you? Me ho yε. My condolences. Medaase. You’re so big now. Aane. Do you remember me? Sure. Then we’re all stood surrounding a rectangle of hollowed-out earth. In there, at the bottom, is my dad. Aunt Abena is adjusting her headpiece and my uncle Osei swats at a fly. James is staring at the ground, Mum is pinching the bridge of her nose, Auntie Mabel has her head bowed and Uncle Freddie dabs his eyes with a white handkerchief. Suddenly I miss the noise from before: the Twi, the cars, the movement. “Are we all here?” Mum’s pastor asks. He’s a tall, lean Black man who must duck to avoid a tree’s swooping branches. “Yes,” Mum says. “Then let us pray. Lord God, we commit this day into Your hands,” he says. “We are gathered here to celebrate the life of Mr. George Wright…” He finishes by telling us that Dad is in a better place and that we as Christians need not mourn, but give thanks to God that we have a place where we will reunite with loved ones
