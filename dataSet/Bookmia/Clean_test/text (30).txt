dumpster at the end of the street, just because I was terrified of my parents finding out.” “Jesus,” I say softly, because I hate the idea of a young Finn so scared, so uncertain. His brain working against him. “That can’t have been easy. I’m so sorry.” “I got good at it.” A rueful smile. “Of course, sometimes I’d have to wear gloves and shower immediately afterward. And of course, my parents eventually found out what I was doing. My dad was furious, and I think my mom was too scared of him to say anything otherwise. And he—he just told me to suck it up, that I was ‘acting fucking insane.’ And ‘don’t you dare let anyone see you doing that.’ ” Finn is breathing a little faster now, a fist clenching on top of the table. “So that’s what I did. My compulsions morphed, and most of my free time was dedicated to figuring out how to make myself feel safe and comfortable without anyone finding out. If there was a speck of something strange on a plate, I’d say I wasn’t hungry. I’d dispose of old sheets, old blankets at school and buy replacements with my Hanukkah money. I wanted to make my dad happy so badly, and that meant not being the fucked-up son he thought I was.” “Finn. You are absolutely not,” I say firmly, wishing I could do more to reassure him.

I’d get stuck in these horrible cycles, scrubbing down the house, returning sets of dishes I’d just bought because I swore the box smelled weird when I opened it up, constantly running laundry because nothing ever seemed clean enough. And then my energy bill went way up and that only added to the stress. I knew I needed to do something, but I didn’t know where to start. It wasn’t until after the finale aired that I started getting help. Hallie was the one who suggested it, actually.” “That’s great,” I say, meaning it. “I’ve been in therapy, too. For generalized anxiety disorder. I think I’ve probably had it most of my life, but I didn’t start seeing someone until my midtwenties. I haven’t gone in a few months—though maybe I should?—but I fucking love therapy.” He nods. “So you get it.” “Not all of it—but some of it.” Then something occurs to me. “What about sex? If that’s okay to ask—since there’s obviously,
