you,” he began. “I’ll take you back to the field to look for Kitt. But we can’t go beyond it; we can’t stray into the town. It’s too dangerous. And after we search the field, you will agree to let me take you somewhere safe. You’ll follow me home.” Iris was silent, but her mind was reeling. “Do you agree to my terms, Iris?” Forest prompted. She nodded. She had every faith Roman was still in the field, waiting for her to come to him. “Yes. Take me there. Now.” They reached the field by evening. Forest had been right; Dacre’s forces now ruled Avalon Bluff. Iris crouched in the grass, staring at the town. Fires were lit and music was pouring like a stream. Smoke still rose from the ashes, but Dacre was celebrating. His white flag with the red eithral eye was raised, flapping in the wind. The gas was long gone by now. As if it had never been. “We’ll have to crawl through the grass,” Forest said, his words clipped with tension. “It looks like Dacre isn’t expecting any retaliation from Enva’s forces. I don’t see any sentries, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t stationed as snipers. So move very slowly, and stay down. Do you hear me?” She nodded. She didn’t spare her brother a glance.

Iris strained her eyes, looking for him amongst the flax. Roman! Her breaths were shallow and painful. Perspiration dripped from her brow, even as the temperature dropped. She searched for him, knowing this had been the spot. She searched, but there was no trace of him. Only his blood, staining the grass. “We need to go, Iris,” Forest whispered. “Wait,” she pleaded. “I know he has to be here.” “He’s not. Look.” Her brother pointed at something. She frowned, studying it. There was a ring drawn in the dirt. It encircled them both as they paused, still lying low. “What is this, Forest?” she asked, finding more of Roman’s blood on the ground. It looked like spilled ink in the dusky light. “We need to go. Now,” he hissed, grabbing her wrist. She didn’t want him touching her, and she lurched away. Her hand still ached, as did her neck. All due to him. “Just a minute longer, Forest,” she begged. “Please.” “He’s not here, Iris. You
