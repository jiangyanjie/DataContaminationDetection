bed with her hand—a gesture made all the more important because of the effort it takes. “As you know, it is the last copy in existence. Study my notebooks, which are filled with my best treatments—” “Grandmother, please. Let us have more days together.” She shakes her head. “I wish I could give you that, but death is coming.” My eyes tell me she’s right even as my heart struggles to accept it. I offer to get Grandfather. “No,” she says, grabbing my hand and holding it with surprising vigor. “Just women…” Before I can protest, she goes on. “If you memorize my formulas—as I taught you to do when you were a girl—I will die content.” She tells me of one notebook in particular in which she’s recorded her best successes. “Keep that one extra safe.” I bow my head and promise to do her bidding. A few minutes later, Miss Zhao returns. She pulls a chair next to mine, and we sit together in silence. My father was gone for Respectful Lady’s final hours, just as Grandfather is away from us now, which makes me wonder if a death vigil is something we women are compelled to do.

My brother is in the capital for his final studies to take the imperial exams, but my father comes to Wuxi to attend his mother’s funeral rites. He brings with him Respectful Lady, who performs her duties well with Miss Zhao’s assistance. As for my father, I had not thought I would see him again, let alone so soon after the re-inquest. He holds me when I weep tears of loss. On the day of Grandmother’s interment, a delegation that includes Master Yang, Lady Kuo, my husband, his uncles, and my two oldest daughters arrives from the Garden of Fragrant Delights. What seems like hundreds of others whom Grandmother treated over the years also come to venerate her and make offerings. I see Midwife Shi, Meiling and her husband. Every mourner wears a shade of white—like the autumn
