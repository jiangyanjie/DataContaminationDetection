my hand on Paige’s shoulder. “I hate to break it to you, but this whole thing”—I gesture to the surrounding woods and cabins—“it’s all fake. It’s not a movie, Paige. It’s just a little fun for people who like to be scared.” Something turns in my gut as I say the words. Like, I know they’re not entirely true. Images of the figure in the water flood my mind, and I look out over the lake. Paige crosses her arms hard over her chest. “Whatever. It’s all fun and games until you’re dead.” “Don’t worry,” Javier says against Tasha’s neck. “I’ll protect you.” Tasha smiles way too hard and loops her arm around his waist. “Well, I’m going to bed,” Porter says dramatically, clapping his hands together. “Kyle, you bunking with me tonight, ’cause I’m scared and I’m not afraid to admit that.” Kyle shrugs. “Fine, but you’re sleeping next to the door.” “The hell I am,” Porter grumbles. I take Bezi’s hand and pull her down the path toward the staff cabins. Kyle and Porter argue about who’s going to fight Ms. Nancy Keane if she shows back up and which one of them is going to cover down for Felix if he misses his morning shift again. Tasha and Javier are saying things to each other that no human ears need to hear. Passing by the lake, I look out over its glassy surface, and a deep sense of foreboding works itself inside my chest and settles there. “I saw something out in the water.” Paige stops dead in her tracks and turns to me. “What?” “In the lake,” I say. I don’t want to keep it to myself anymore. I’m bothered by what I saw in a way that I can’t shake off. “During the game yesterday. I thought one of the guests went out there and was drowning. I grabbed the life preserver from the lifeguard station and threw it in the water.” “You saw a person?” Bezi asks. Everyone is looking at me now. “I thought it was—at first. But I kept looking, and they didn’t reach for me or try to move. They didn’t make a noise or anything.” As I think about it, the initial splash was the only noise I’d heard and then nothing but silence. “There was something in the water, but I wasn’t sure exactly what.” I start to doubt what I saw. Saying it aloud makes it sound ridiculous. A person? Not a person? An animal? I shake my head. “Maybe working out here is getting to me.” Bezi squeezes my hand as she gazes across the lake. “I don’t like it.” “It was probably a carp or something,” Kyle says. “They’re all in the lakes out here and they’re huge. They can be three or four feet long. Bigger if they have a food source.” “Maybe,” I say, even though I don’t believe for one second that what I saw was a fish. This place—in the middle of the woods, far from anything—that’s scary enough as it is. It’s the
