I have is the hard-won spoils from spending the bulk of my childhood with braces and the haircut of an unfortunate poodle. “Sabrina,” I say, “tends to embellish.” Weirdly, though, her descriptions of him didn’t come close to capturing the man. Or maybe it was that because I knew she had a crush on him, I’d expected something different. Someone more polished, suave. Someone more like Parth, his best friend. The corners of his mouth twitch as he ambles forward. My heart whirs as he reaches out, as if planning to catch my chin and turn it side to side for his inspection to prove that I’ve been oversold. But he’s only taking my bag from my shoulder. “They said you were a brunette.” My own snort-laugh surprises me. “I’m glad they spoke so highly of me.” “They did,” he says, “but the only thing I can corroborate so far is whether you’re a brunette. Which you’re not.” “I am definitely a brunette.” He tosses my bag into the back seat, then faces me again, his hips sinking against the door. His head tilts thoughtfully. “Your hair’s almost black. In the moonlight it looks blue.” “Blue?” I say. “You think my hair is blue?” “Not, like, Smurf blue,” he says. “Blue black. You can’t tell in pictures. You look different.” “It’s true,” I say. “In real life, I’m three-dimensional.” “The painting,” he says thoughtfully. “That looks like you.” I instantly know which painting he must be referring to. The one of me and Sabrina strewn out like God and Adam: Cleo’s old figure drawing final. It hung in Mattingly’s art building for weeks, dozens of strangers passing it daily, and I never felt so naked then as I do now. “Very discreet way of letting me know you’ve seen my boobs,” I say. “Shit.” He glances away, rubbing the back of his neck. “I sort of forgot it was a nude.” “Words most women only ever dream of hearing,” I say. “I in no way forgot you were naked in the painting,” he clarifies. “I just forgot it might be weird to tell someone they look exactly the same as they do in a painting where they’re not wearing clothes.” “This is going really well,” I say. He groans and drags a hand down his face. “I swear I’m normally better at this.” And normally, I do my best to put people at ease, but there’s something rewarding about throwing him off-balance. Rewarding and charming. “Better at what?” I say through laughter. He rakes one hand through his hair. “First impressions.” “You should try sending a big-ass nude painting of yourself ahead when you’re going to meet someone new,” I say. “It’s always worked for me.” “I’ll take that into consideration,” he says. “You don’t look like a Wyndham Connor.” His brow arches. “How am I supposed to look?” “I don’t know,” I say. “Navy-blue jacket with gold buttons. Captain’s hat. A big white beard and a huge cigar?” “So Santa, on a yacht,” he says. “Mr. Monopoly, on vacation,” I say.
