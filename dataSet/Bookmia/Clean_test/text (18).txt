at his watch with a frown. “What’s wrong, Kitt?” “We have exactly five minutes to get back to Marisol’s.” “What?” “We’ll have to run the whole way to make it by eight, but it’s mostly downhill.” “Kitt!” He began to jog the route they had come, and Iris had no choice but to chase after him, ankles sore as her boots hit the cobblestones. Oh, she was going to kill him. They were late by seven minutes. {28} A Divine Rival Dear Iris, Last night, I had a dream. I was standing in the middle of Broad Street in Oath, and it was raining. You walked past me; I knew it was you the moment your shoulder brushed mine. But when I tried to call your name, no sound emerged. When I hurried to follow you, you quickened your steps. Soon, the rain fell harder, and you slipped away from me. I never saw your face, but I knew it was you. It was only a dream, but it has unquieted me. Write to me and tell me how you are. Yours, —C.

Are you a student at university? Are you working somewhere? Tell me something about you. Love, Iris They had planted the garden but had completely forgotten to water it. Marisol grimaced when she realized this. “I don’t even want to know what Keegan will think of me,” she said, hand on her forehead as she stared at the crooked rows Iris and Attie had made. “My wife is fighting on the front lines
