even just send someone to take them. One of Mr. Zoegar’s many counterparts in his organisation. He might even go to court. But if, say, a man who functions as a damper on all things Titanic were to vouch for their destruction to Stefan while nonetheless delivering them to me…that would be an optimal outcome.” “That’s not the same thing. You said the Travis. Stealing’s another matter.” “It is the same thing, sir. The Travis and I…we are one, financially speaking. When all the shells are plucked away and the cockle is winkled from the rock. I can even prove it to you, though with that level of knowledge of my affairs would come certain constraints upon you. No, there’s no need for that, Mr. Sounder. You can just drop them discreetly at the front desk. The staff will accommodate you as to timing and matters of…tradecraft.” “You want me to lie to Stefan.” “I offer you the opportunity to defeat him, in this one, small way.” “Why would I want to do that?” “Oh, come now. Everyone who meets him longs to beat him in one way or another. Otherwise we must acknowledge we are outmatched, made secondary in our own world. If we do not defeat the Titan king, what is left to us but obsolescence?” “You think that’s going to persuade me?” “I’m interested to find out. Who are you, Cal Sounder? I told you one story, will you not tell me another? Who are you?” “I’m sure you did your research.” “I did, but you’re an enigma, sir. A nobody, and yet somehow also a pin around which the city turns. Of course you’re only a small businessman, but you are, undeniably, something of a figure in all of this, and I cannot for the life of me see how it comes to be so. You walk with giants. Are you on a mission? Like Peter, a grieving husband nursing a grudge? A son seeking vengeance? Is there some heroic story playing out here that I’m not aware of? Whatever it is, you may not be in the job much longer. I have my spies: Stefan is unhappy with you. He feels you have fumbled in this matter. And perhaps it means more to him than just a liver and some offal.” “What do you want them for?” Doublewide steeples those long fingers. Long enough to go all the way around my head. The leverage on those arms would let him twist it off like the top of a ketchup bottle. “I think what I do with them once I have them is my business, Mr. Sounder.” “If you’re going against Stefan, you’re going to need a lot more than Mr. Zoegar here.” “Oh, not against. Never against. Around, beneath, beside. Orthogonal influence, dimensionalities of control. We are not in collision, for all that we occasionally abrade. But you? Do you think he won’t pin you in a case like a butterfly?” “I can handle Stefan.” The huge chest rocks, and the head lolls from side to side.
