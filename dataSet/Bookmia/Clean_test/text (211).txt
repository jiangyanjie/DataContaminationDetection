braiding in and out of what Wyn told me earlier. I genuinely convinced myself that was the kind of guy you wanted to be with. And you kept pushing the wedding off. You never wanted to talk about it. You never wanted to talk about anything. You were never mad at me. You never fought with me. It felt like you didn’t even miss me. I kept so much of what I was feeling from him, thinking the weight of my emotions would only drive him further from me, push him back behind a door I couldn’t open. And even after he told me that tonight, I felt trapped inside myself, unable to get the words out. Now they wriggle in my gut, burrowing deeper, gaining ground. As soon as I make the decision, time accordions. The steep climb up the bluff, the length of the patio, the creaky stairs, the hallway—it all blurs past and I’m standing at his door. Knocking quietly. Maybe have been for a while, even, because the door’s already swinging open, as if he’s been waiting. That would explain why he’s fully dressed, but not why he looks so surprised. Not the way his lips part and his brow furrows as I seem to float into the room, inflated with helium-light purpose. And it definitely wouldn’t explain the packed luggage sitting by the door. At the sight of it, a hot coal slips down my throat, hits the deepest pit of my stomach and sizzles. “You’re leaving?” His steel-gray gaze flicks back toward his luggage. “I thought that might be easiest.” “Easiest,” I murmur. “How?

I step in close enough to feel the warmth radiating off him. “We’re in an all-out brawl.” He looks away, the corners of his mouth twisting downward. “About what?” “For starters, about the fact that you packed your bags up in the night,” I say, pressing closer. He takes a half step back. My voice wobbles. “And I don’t want you to go.” His hands come to my hips, holding me but keeping me at a distance. “I shouldn’t have come in the first place,” he says. “This is all my fault.” “No, it’s not,” I say. “It is,” he says, insistent. I press closer. Our chests brush. “There,” I say. “There what?” “Something else we have to fight about,” I say. Faintly, grudgingly, he smiles. It doesn’t last. He glances away, his brow tightening. “I’m so fucking sorry, Harriet,” he says. “If I’d just stayed away this week like I said I would . . .” I set my hands on his shoulders, and his eyes snap to mine, a current flaring in them. I push down gently, and he sits at
