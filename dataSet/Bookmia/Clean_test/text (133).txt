his arms fall to his sides as his mouth forms a little O. “Fall in line,” Mr. Lamont orders. Kyle raises his hands in front of him. “Please. Please don’t hurt me.” Mr. Lamont flicks the gun, gesturing for Kyle to move. He stumbles over to me and stays behind me as we all go into the lodge single file. Mr. Lamont gestures to the couch, and I help Bezi take a seat while Kyle settles next to her. I go to sit down when the tip of my sneaker bumps up against something partially hidden under the couch. It’s dark. I’m having trouble seeing, but as my eyes adjust, I realize it’s a hand, clenched into a bloody fist, and on the wrist is a bright pink hair tie. I stumble back and fall hard onto the ground. From the floor, I have a clear view of Tasha’s and Javier’s bloodied faces. Their bodies lie tangled together under the couch. A scream claws its way up my throat and erupts from behind my lips. My cries split the air, and Mr. Lamont delivers a swift kick to my leg. “Get up,” he growls. I pull myself onto the couch, and I can feel the soft bulges of Tasha’s and Javier’s corpses through the thin fabric. Bezi leans against me, sobbing. The orange glow from the fireplace washes the room in a gauzy light, and Mr. Lamont stands backlit by the flames, like a monster emerging from the depths of hell. “You killed them,” I say through a blur of tears. “You’re with those people from the woods.” Mr. Lamont narrows his eyes at me. “No. Not with them.” He keeps the gun trained on me as he speaks. “Do you know where you are right now?” I exchange glances with Kyle. “I don’t know what you mean,” I say. “Of course you don’t,” Mr. Lamont says dismissively. “This particular piece of land has been used for generations by those Owl Society folks.” Mr. Lamont points the gun at me and clenches his jaw, then smiles. “That’s what they call themselves,” Mr. Lamont says. “They’ve always been here. They stole this land from the folks who were here before. Been conducting their meetings and rituals in the forest around here ever since. Seeding the land with blood and giving the flesh over to the lake.” My mind goes in circles. “The man in the owl mask told me.” Mr. Lamont tilts his head. “Did he now?” He seems irritated. “He was a regular chatty Cathy with you, huh? I couldn’t get him to tell me a damn thing. Did he tell you about the ritual too?” He drags his hand across his gut in the same spot where Porter was sliced open. “Spill the blood on the ground, dump the corpse in the lake, recite the words. Not necessarily in that order.” He shakes his head and toes at the floor with the tip of his boot. “They could have anything they want, but the price—the price always has to be paid
