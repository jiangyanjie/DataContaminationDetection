the more ambiguous “flatmate.” Grace: Absolutely not Erin: Is he tall? Olu: Depends how close you are. If she’s your best friend then no but if you just know her like if you saw her on the street you might not even wave, then it’s fine Megan: Were they official or was it some kind of 2 week thing Debs: How did they end things?

If it was amicable then I don’t see why not Maddie Jo’s ex (casual sex, no relationship I think) asked me out to dinner. Should I go? Shu Who’s Jo? Nia Is he nice?
