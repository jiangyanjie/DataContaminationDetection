turn your clothes inside out, do you disappear? I have always wondered.” The dark mood vanished like smoke, and he gave me a youthful grin. “Shall we try it?” “Oh, yes,” I said, an unlikely giggle escaping me. I seized his cloak and reversed it, and he pulled it on. “Oh,” he said, his face blank. “What is it?” I gripped his arm. “Wendell? What’s wrong?” “I don’t—I feel most unwell.” He let me strip the cloak from him, and then he collapsed into the chair. Only after I had made him another mug of chocolate and built the fire up for him again did he start to laugh at me. “Bastard,” I said, which only made him laugh harder. I stomped off to my room, having had quite enough of him for one night. 17th November I woke some hours before dawn in the quiet of a winter night, snow pattering against the window. Shadow was curled against my back, his favourite position, nose whistling. I lit the lantern upon my bedside table (both lantern and table had appeared earlier in the week, despite my objections) and held my hand up to the light. For a moment, I saw something—a shadow upon my third finger. It was visible only from the corner of my eye, and only then when I let my mind wander and did not think of it. My hand was very cold.

Each time I open my mouth to tell Wendell, a fog arises in my thoughts, and I know that if he were to ask me whether I have been enchanted, I would lie quite convincingly. “Shit,” I said. I took out my coin and pressed it to my hand. I did not know what manner of enchantment the king in the tree had ensnared me with. What was clear was that I was ensnared. Now, there are faerie enchantments that fade with time and distance if they are not renewed. I could only hope it was of this nature. If I found my feet taking me back to the tree, I would have to cut off my own hand. Naturally, I spent the rest of the night in a misery of shame and worry, cursing myself. The worst of it was that Bambleby had warned me away from the tree—if I descended into a murderous rage, or turned into a tree myself, he would be very smug about it.
