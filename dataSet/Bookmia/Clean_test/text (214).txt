table and from me, but I’m desperate. “Maybe it will get better and I just have to keep trying?” “I can’t know you’re in pain and still…” He looks up, at least. “I really am sorry.” It’s that easy to get rid of me. To erase me from his life and whatever slot I may have filled in his future. He doesn’t need to think on me a little longer. Short-term. Just like you wanted, right? I nod my head because this is what I deserve, and he does the same. One thing I can appreciate is his honesty, because God knows he received none of that from me. Chapter Thirty-six Friday afternoon, Penny reminds me of my first official appointment with Angelina. I nod. “I’m going now.” Penny never reminds me of anything because it’s my job to do that for her, but I know it’s because I look like the bird the cat dragged in, and I can only imagine what people told her once I’d left the office yesterday. I put my computer in sleep mode and head downstairs. * * * Today Angelina’s hair is straight and tucked behind her ears and her wooden earrings almost rest on her collarbone. Her lips, like her nails, are painted a burnt orange—how bold. “Maddie, you look … Are you all right?” “Of course,” I answer. Last time, the HR room was hot, but I’m shivering today. “My dad’s funeral is tomorrow, so I’ve not had much sleep. I’m fine, though. I’ve been meaning to ask, do you have a yellow pantsuit?” Her face remains illegible. “I do.” “Me too, but I still haven’t worn it.” I look at the clock. Only two minutes have passed. “I talk to myself a lot. In my head and out loud,” I tell her. “Is that weird?” “Why do you talk to yourself out loud?” I shrug. “Sometimes my head is too full and it makes what I’m thinking clearer. I know not to do it in public.” “So you’re often alone, I take it?” she asks. “If you talk to yourself a lot, but not in public, you must be by yourself quite a bit.” “I like my own company.” “Have you always?” “What do you mean?” “I believe in two dominant introvert types. Those who have always enjoyed their own company and those who have grown to prefer it because they weren’t given much of a choice. Which do you think you fit into?” I think about how small my room back home is and how I used to tell myself I loved it because its purpose was to house only one and I fit comfortably inside. James had a life I wasn’t cool or old enough to fit into, Mum had a life on another continent, and my dad had his slowly taken away. “Maybe the second,” I answer. “Do you talk much to other people?” “Of course.” “About more significant things?” Angelina clarifies. “Not just everyday pleasantries, but private matters. How you are and what you’re thinking, for example.” “Why?”
