substance is Blood,” she says, ignoring him. “They sound like the same word, but how are they different?” This is a simple question with an easy answer. “We have the blood we can see when our skin gets cut,” I say, “but Blood is a bigger essence. In women, Blood is the leader. It is what allows a woman to become pregnant and feed a fetus. It turns into mother’s milk upon her giving birth.” “Exactly. You must put aside the idea of function,” Grandmother Ru explains. “We are not concerned with veins and arteries, muscles and bones, or organs with specific occupations. We are looking to find how illnesses arise from imbalances in the bodily form of yin and yang. They interact like night flowing into day and winter into summer. One is always rising and one is always falling, never stopping. In the process, they are repairing and transforming each other. As physicians, we aspire to bring yin and yang into balance so the life force is strong. What else can you tell me about the body as the universe?” And on it goes, with Grandfather and Grandmother asking me questions and me trying my best to please them with my answers. When I’m with them—even though they are constantly testing me—I can almost forget how much I miss my mother, my father, our home… Just everything… * * * During my time in Wuxi, I’ve been mostly confined to the women’s quarters with concubines and wives, toddlers and children, and older girls who are preparing for marriage.

I’m thankful for Miss Zhao, who oversees my daily lessons. I think she’s grateful to me too, since she’s having a hard time being accepted by the other concubines. She’s a good teacher—more patient than my mother but no less demanding. When I want to be alone, I go to my room and climb into Respectful Lady’s marriage bed. It has a roof, windows covered with silk paintings showing scenes of poetic life, and a canopy over the entrance with wooden tassels that hang down as decoration, all carved from rosewood, pearwood, and boxwood, and fitted together without a single nail. There are two antechambers—the first is where a maid sleeps on the floor, and the second is a dressing room. The third room holds the raised sleeping platform. On one of my first nights here, I remembered the loose panel Respectful Lady liked to touch. I wiggled it free and found a secret shelf. For a moment, I hoped she’d hidden something there for me, but no. She knew it existed, though, and to keep my connection to her I set her
