upstairs wondering how long I have to stay. My dad’s not here anymore and I hate this house because of it. The house that I left him alone in. I’m not really here. I’m not really here. Everything is fine because I’m not really here. The sun bursts in through the window and I have to shield my eyes before closing the curtains. Chapter Twenty Ben I’m here if you need me xx It’s an ordinary week within the most extraordinary circumstances because apparently—and this is what everyone fails to mention about the grieving process—I still have to live. Nia has a few assignments to turn in still, which she can do online, so during the day she sets herself up in the living room. On Wednesday she makes me pancakes and we watch TV. She opens her laptop to complete a project, and I say I need the toilet but end up closing the door of my bedroom. I get into bed and watch TV on my phone. By the afternoon, I don’t know how many episodes I’ve watched. Nia calls me down for lunch, but I say I’m still full from breakfast. Mum calls. “The funeral home says we need to go there and fill out some forms.” “Oh, okay.” “No, I’m going to get your father’s brother to do that when he arrives, since Mabel is still in Ghana trying to change her return date,” she says. “You’re too young. Only twenty-five and burying your father, it shouldn’t be on you. I’m going to make sure Freddie does it. I don’t want that on your shoulders.” “Thank you, Mum.” “That’s why I’m here, darling.” “I love you.” “I love you too, Maame.” * * * Nia and I go for a walk across Battersea Riverside whilst Nia tells me about one of her professors—long story short, Nia is not a fan. We then talk about school; we agree we feel nostalgic but would never go back. Nia returns to her laptop and I try to read but the words swim on the page and the attempt itself is exhausting so I get into bed until dinner, which is sweet potato and roasted vegetables. We eat together and start a thriller series called The Cabin Plan. We watch four episodes before bed. * * * On Thursday, Nia sleeps in and I sit on the sofa, staring into the garden. I search my phone for the latest picture of Dad. When I can’t find it, I panic because it’s the only one I have. “Oh God, oh God, please no.” I scroll through picture after picture of pretty buildings and food. Finally, I find and favorite it so it’s easier to reach next time. In the picture, James has dragged a chair to the front door so that Dad could sit outside. He hadn’t been outside in a very long time; I’d guess months, but if I force myself to think, it could have been years. It’s a horrifying thought, which even the most dedicated of introverts would balk at
