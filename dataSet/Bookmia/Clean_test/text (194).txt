They continued on through the forest. Before long, Vic felt what they’d heard. It started with the hairs on his arms standing on end, moving up to his shoulders and neck before settling in his head. His teeth felt loose in their sockets, his tongue like sandpaper. It was electricity, a powerful current. And then he heard the hum. Constant and irritating, it filled his head with static. His breath caught in his chest as he saw a flash of white light through the trees, blinking once, twice, three times. He stopped when Hap grabbed his arm. He looked back. “What?” Hap shook his head. “Just … be c-careful.” Hap’s forehead was scrunched up, his eyes narrowed. He didn’t let go of Vic’s arm as they moved toward the light and sound. His skin—strange, Vic thought to himself, how real it felt, how like his own even with the wood—was cool. They stopped at the tree line. Vic couldn’t understand what he was seeing, not in any real, clear way. Later, he’d blame the electricity, believing that it clouded his mind, making it nearly impossible for him to grasp the sight before them. He’d never seen such a thing before, though he’d known it existed. Seeing it was something else entirely, and he was at a loss for words. “What is it?” Rambo asked from off to his right. “The road,” Nurse Ratched said. “It is the road.” It stretched in either direction as far as Vic could see. The surface was flat, black, and bisected with white, glowing lines. On the other side of the road, towering at least ten feet above it, were black metal pylons, the tops of which curved inward, blue lights blinking in a row. The air between the pylons shimmered; the electrical current grew louder, causing Vic to stretch his jaw, the joints popping. His helmet slid down on his head. He pushed it back up, wincing at the static shock at the tips of his fingers. “Whoa,” Rambo said, sensors brighter than Vic had ever seen. “It’s so loud. It makes me feel like I could go as fast as I could forever.” He started toward it, but Hap let Vic go and scooped Rambo up, wheels still spinning, spindly arms reaching. “N-no,” Hap said. “D-don’t.” “What? Why? I want to touch it.” Hap shook his head. “It will h-hurt you.” Rambo stopped struggling. “It will? How do you know?” “Watch.” Hap set him down on the ground. He walked toward the road, each step careful. He stopped a few feet away from the nearest pylon. Vic watched as he crouched down and picked up a thin metal bar, the edges worn and cracked. It looked as if it’d broken off whatever it’d been attached to. He stood back up, tapping the bar against the wood of his other hand. The sound was muted under the hum of the current. He threw the bar at the road. It never touched the ground. Instead, electricity snapped and snarled, arcing blue and sending a shower of sparks
