husband was a boy, his father kept thousands of concubines. His favorite was Consort Wan. The Chunghua emperor lost all interest in his wife, Empress Wu, who had already given him a son. Meanwhile, the consort struggled to get pregnant.” Empress Zhang’s voice lowers as she reveals what few outside the palace know. “Every time Consort Wan heard that another concubine was with child, she had that woman poisoned or secretly gave her herbs so she would miscarry. Empress Wu realized she and her son could be targets of the consort as well, and they went into hiding. Eunuchs and others protected them. When the emperor died, my husband ascended the throne. Consort Wan disappeared. No one has heard of her again.” While the story is from a previous generation, it’s a reminder that Empress Zhang is attuned to palace intrigue and won’t permit it. She looks around, taking in the women in her presence. “My husband is a follower of Confucius, Buddhism, and Taoism. He believes in rectitude and obedience. To honor his mother and all she did to protect him, he sets an example for the rest of the country—not just here in the palace. This is why today you find no concubines, consorts, or secondary wives in the Great Within.” Having the opportunity to oversee the empress’s birth is without doubt a great honor, even if it doesn’t come with the same rewards Meiling will receive. (This is as it should be. Meiling will be actively involved in the delivery, while I will attend only when the empress requests my presence or if a complication should arise.) I’ll admit I wish I liked Empress Zhang more than I do. Although she can recite history and her place in it, I find her shallow. She’s tantalized by a new purchase or gift, but her enchantment is short-lived. She immediately wants something else that’s exotic or priceless—another multilayered headdress bedecked with jewels, a figurine of the Goddess Guanyin carved in ivory, a pair of life-sized marble lions. She enjoys the foods that come to the palace as tribute, but then needs my help with her resulting indigestion and sleeplessness. And yet… She is still just a woman. She’s as nervous about giving birth to her first child—who we all hope will be a son and the future emperor—as Meiling, a midwife with much experience. I’m a doctor, but I find both women look to me more for my personal experience, having gone through labor and successfully brought into the world three babies, albeit girls, than for the herbs they should take. “Doctor Tan.” I shake myself out of my thoughts. “Yes, Compassionate One?” “What ingredients does your family use for making mother’s soup?” Empress Zhang asks. She’s questioned me about this many times these past weeks, hoping, I believe, that I’ll name something that will require her to dispatch men to find a rare ingredient. She is the embodiment of One eye on the dish in front of her and one eye on the saucepan. “Everyone makes mother’s soup a little
