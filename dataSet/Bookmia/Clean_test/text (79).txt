a waist small enough to make you worry. There’s some crazy whaleboning around the back so she can breathe deep enough to sing. Under the beehive wig her hair’s so pale it’s almost silver, and her dark eyes make her seem ghostly in the warm light of the dressing room fireplace. She wears ear studs, black pearls, but she’s hardly the only woman in the city with pierced ears. The shawl is silver brocade, just different enough to match. “Wait a minute,” she says, reaching behind with both hands. I look away, and hear a whomp and a thump as the dress hits the ground. “You can look,” she says, amused. “I’m decent.” That might be an overstatement, though it’s technically true. Some kind of strapless sports top and shorts. She laughs at me and wraps the shawl around her middle like a beach dress. “Better?” Actually now instead of looking like an attractive woman in sweaty workout gear she looks like an attractive woman wrapped in a silk thing that’s not really big enough for the job, but never mind. “Cal Sounder,” I say. She laughs. “Mr. Sounder, there’s no one in Victor’s tonight who doesn’t know that.” “I guess not.” “What can I do for you?” “You can tell me about the bulletproof scarf.” She touches it gently. “A gift.” “Someone worried about your safety.” “I’m a singer. I get the wrong kinds of fans sometimes. I get letters, flowers, even visits. People see me onstage and they’re moved, but they don’t have the sophistication to understand the difference between an emotional response and a relationship. A little extra protection never hurts. Besides, I think it’s beautiful. Don’t you?” She shifts her shoulders, making the shawl shimmer. “And the…concerned party? They understand that difference?” “Yes. He does.” “A boyfriend.” “I hope that isn’t disappointing to you, Mr. Sounder. This is going to be a conversation, between us. Nothing more.” “No, that’s what I came for: to talk.” “So talk. I’m secretly hoping you work for a record label.” “I’m a police consultant. What can you tell me about the man who gave you the scarf?” “Roddy? Is he in trouble?” “No.” Which is not exactly a lie. “I promise I’ll explain, but I’d like to talk first so your answers aren’t coloured by the situation now.” “Consultant, you said. Not detective.” “No. Officially retained, but not actually police.” “I don’t know whether I want to help you. How do I know you’re on my side?” “Ask Victor.” “Because everyone trusts Victor.” “Everyone who knows her.” Which is true. Victor is a whole bucket of crazy in that velvet catsuit, but in the end, she has rules and she follows them all the way down into the mud. “And what would Victor say about you?” “That I can help you. That I’ll do my best for Roddy. That I play straight as I can. She made me promise to be nice to you.” “Doesn’t that mean she thought you might not?” “Means she thought my promise was worth something.” “And Sam?”
