saying them. It’s gotta be this Owl Society, right?” Bezi nods as she circles the room. “It’s a secret society?” “Looks like it. But what are—were they doing?” It occurs to me in that moment that maybe this so-called Owl Society isn’t some relic of the long-forgotten past. Somebody hurt Tasha, and Porter and Paige are missing. On the wall next to the large photograph, there are smaller portraits in heavy brass and silver frames. Individuals in the same seated pose, all of them wearing black cloaks. The photos go from black-and-white to sepia to full color. Each portrait adorned with a small plaque. Henry Woodsworth Hayward Grand Owl, 1856 Johnathan Laurens Montevallo Grand Owl, 1867 Lawrence Ulrich Davis Grand Owl, 1872 More portraits ring the room, each of them featuring a man in the same pose, the same steely look in his eyes. “What’s a Grand Owl?” Bezi asks. “I don’t like the way that sounds at all.” I’m not sure, but it looks like each of the men was a leader of this Owl Society at some point. The newest portrait is dated 1973. “I wonder what happened after 1973,” Bezi says. “They just disappeared?” I think about Tasha and about what Ms. Keane said. Is it possible they’re still here? I suddenly feel the urge to bolt from the lodge and run as fast as I can back to the camp. I take Bezi’s hands and prepare to do just that when something stops me. A sound. I hold my breath and angle my head toward the hall. “Do you hear that?” Bezi stares at me wide-eyed, listening. A muffled shriek sounds from somewhere nearby. I glance toward the window, still not daring to breathe. It sounds again and sends a bolt of unfiltered terror straight through me. It is the sound a person makes when they’re in pain—when they’re terrified. Tasha had made that noise when I approached her in the lodge, and someone else is making it now. I glance down at my feet. The sound bleeds out of the cracks between the wooden floorboards, as if the house itself is screaming. Bezi takes out her phone, glances at the screen, and shakes her head. Still no signal. We are alone and I have to make another snap decision. Everything in me is telling me to run away from this place as fast as I can and never look back, but the scream sounds again, and I swear there are words mixed in with the agonized cries. Help me. I take a deep breath and try to put my thoughts together. “I need to find a way downstairs. Let’s look for some stairs or a door or something.” Bezi nods, but I can see the hesitation in her pinched expression. I lead her out into the hall and tiptoe through the corridor, looking for a way to the lower levels of the lodge. We move silently past a dated kitchen and I stop. “What’s wrong?” Bezi asks. I duck inside the kitchen and approach the center island.
