She doesn’t answer. I leave a message telling her if she wants my help she can have it, and here’s my daily rate. I call Athena because I want to. She doesn’t answer either. I sit until my feet stop hurting and the itch gets warm under my rib cage. Then I get my coat and go down to Gull Town, the worn-out, lower-rent business district inland and a little west of the point. It’s the place some start-ups are born, but mostly it’s where companies go to die. In a brownstone that really is brown, organic and mossy from the alpine dust, a guy called Orhan runs a business doing credit and background checks for schools that don’t want to hire someone with the wrong sort of convictions. On off days, he runs searches for people like me. Orhan’s a grinder, not an artist, but I can’t lean on Floyd Ostby all the time; he’d push back. I give Orhan two names: Mac Denton, and Roy Mullen. “What do you want, Cal? What are you looking for?” “Denton, you’re gonna find all kinds of shit on him. Bullying, light assault and some harassment. Make a list but don’t foreground it. I want to know if he’s been lucky recently. Maybe a distant relative died and he inherits twenty thousand. Like that.” “This relative attach any kind of conditions to so generous a bequest?” “Maybe to beat me down in public.” “Always nice people we deal with, Cal.” “I hear ya. The other one, Roy Mullen, he was a cop. Tread light, but I’m pretty sure he took money to drive over my witness and shoot her in the chest. She died. He got me pretty good, too.” Orhan raises bushy eyebrows. “How’d that work out for him?” “Not well. Figure you’ve got a few hours before they shut his accounts.” “You seem like you’re having a time, Cal. I’ll do you a solid and check your man Denton for outgoings in the same amount, in case he maybe sends someone to let you know he is unhappy.” “Thanks, Orhan.” He shrugs. “Got to protect my revenue streams. It’s not a favourable economy.” * * * — From Orhan’s I head north again, then take a waterbus along the shore and duck inland to Victor’s. She’s not there, which is fine, because I want to talk to Sam. “How’s your chef?” “I am not discussing that with you.” “Come on, Sam, it’s just small talk before I ask you what you really don’t want to talk about with me.” “She’s fine, Cal. She has doubts about me as a long-term partner.” “I don’t.” “Well, that’s great, let’s get hitched right away.” “Come work with me. That gets you away from Victor’s. You can bootstrap to respectable security professional.” “Yeah, sure, because just everyone thinks you’re respectable.” “Athena does and that’s all that matters.” “So I hear. Also that you keep stepping back, which I understand conceptually but for the record: you’re an idiot.” That is probably true. * * * — “Sam,
