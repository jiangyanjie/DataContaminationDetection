concentration could hurt not only herself but also the other dancers, Marion steeled her mind and her body as she fell backward, ever so slowly, to the floor. At the final beat they all turned their heads out to the audience to give the salute. As the lights went down, Marion’s attention was drawn to where Peter was sitting. A man in an usher’s uniform stood right next to him, whispering and gesturing. Peter said something back, shook his head, but then the usher took his arm. Marion had to get backstage to change costumes for the next number, but she got one more look back before she disappeared into the wings. Peter’s seat was empty. The usher had forced him out. That only left Tommy, who was all the way at the back of the theater. Unless he, too, had been removed. Marion’s mind raced as she changed backstage into a long robe with a hood for the nativity scene. What was she going to do now? Her breathing became strained. It was as if she couldn’t pull in enough oxygen to keep her heart pumping. The Rockette standing next to her looked over, worried. “Are you okay?” So far, none of the other dancers had said anything about Marion taking Bunny’s place. Replacements happened all the time, and most of the girls probably didn’t even know she’d left the troupe. Marion panted, one hand on her hip. “I can’t breathe.” This was no time to be keeling over. The dancer who was in charge of leading out the camel—a good-natured creature called Cornelius—moved closer. “Is everything all right?” she asked. Cornelius nudged his way over as well, as if interested in the answer. Marion shook her head. No, everything was quite wrong, in fact. Just then, the camel sneezed, spraying Marion directly in the face with wet strands of mucus. She straightened up, stunned, and wiped her face with her robe while the dancers around her erupted in giggles. While unwelcome, the shower of slime pulled her right out of her panic attack. She silently thanked the camel as the music swelled and they all marched back onstage. From her position far stage right, Marion got a good look at Martinek. He was still there. She was supposed to be facing upstage, gazing up at the manger where the baby Jesus lay, like all the other dancers. But since the hood kept her face in shadow, she cheated out, keeping her eyes on their target. Martinek slowly leaned down and fumbled with something at his feet, then straightened back up. He’d removed the bomb from the briefcase. Marion held her breath as he reached into his coat. Everyone around Martinek was gazing up at the stage, at the animals and the nativity tableau. Having live animals onstage hypnotized the Radio City audiences, as one never knew if a sheep might balk or a donkey might decide to do his business right as the baby Jesus was lifted into the air. The latter had happened during a couple of shows, and
