branches, bright eyes opened and stared back at him. Vic didn’t have time to shout in warning as Hap leapt from the thick branch he’d been standing on. The air whistled around him as he plummeted toward the forest floor. Hitting the ground between them in a crouch, he rose swiftly, scooping up Rambo and holding him high above his head. Rambo’s wheels spun uselessly, arms flailing as he screamed he was too young to die, that he had plans and dreams and who was going to clean up all the dirt on the floors if he was dead? No one, that’s who! Nurse Ratched instantly transformed into a nightmare, all of her tentacles snapping out from her sides, the tips crackling and snarling in metal blurs as they whipped around her. “Put him down,” she said, rolling forward. “If you do not, I will end the pathetic existence you call a life.” “Vic!” Rambo cried. “I’m being brave, but it’s really hard!” “Don’t hurt him,” Vic pleaded as Hap glared at the advancing Nurse Ratched, Rambo still high above his head. “I’m n-n-not,” Hap spat. “L-l-look.” Hap nodded toward the ground where Rambo had been rolling over. There, sitting on the petals of a pink-and-purple autumn crocus, was a butterfly. A large monarch, its wings a deep orange bordered in black, the tips spotted in white and yellow. They opened and closed as the antennae of the butterfly twitched in the failing light. Hap tossed Rambo aside as he crouched in front of the insect. Rambo bounced on his back before landing on his wheels. Hap leaned closer to the butterfly, his face scrunched up in concentration. The butterfly ignored the large machine towering over it, going about its business with the crocus. As Vic looked on, Nurse Ratched’s tentacles powering down, Hap reached toward the insect. Without thinking, Vic shot forward, grabbing Hap’s wrist before he could pick up the butterfly. Warm synthetic skin and metal surrounded by flesh and bone. Alarm bells rang in Vic’s mind as Hap lifted his head slowly, first looking at Vic’s grip, then sliding up the arm to his shoulder, chin, nose, eyes. His lips pulled back over his teeth, and Vic felt him beginning to tense. “You’ll hurt it,” Vic blurted. Hap jerked his arm free. “I didn’t.” “But you could,” Nurse Ratched said. “Butterfly wings are delicate. Touching one might cause the colors to fade, leaving the butterfly open to predators. It will not kill it immediately, but you are sentencing it to death regardless.” At the sound of approaching footsteps Vic whirled around, heart in his throat. Dad stood there among the trees. Vic could barely parse the expression on his face: a mixture of anger and sadness and something far more serious, almost like resignation. But Dad did not look at Vic; he only had eyes for Hap. “Nurse Ratched. A light, if you please.” “Yes, Gio.” Her screen lit up white, illuminating the darkness. Hap’s shadow stretched off into the forest, colliding with trees and shrubbery. Hap didn’t move
