which he then gave to her. Around eight or nine, he said that he was tired. He went to bed early in their little guest room, where he’d been sleeping for the past few nights so he wouldn’t keep her awake with his coughing. She heard him clear his throat and cough a few times, but then he fell silent, and she assumed he’d finally gotten to sleep. When she went in to check on him later— “He was so cold.” She said his name, and then she called out for him, and then she shook him. She repeated these steps, over and over. He didn’t wake. She called 911, and paramedics arrived within five minutes. As she speaks, I try to picture the uniformed strangers who tried to save my father; who climbed onto the mattress, pushed up their sleeves, and pushed down on his chest so hard that the wooden slats of the antique bed frame snapped beneath their efforts. They worked diligently, efficiently, taking turns with air and compressions while my mother sobbed and prayed. It will be weeks before it occurs to either of us that Dad had a do-not-resuscitate order in his advance directives, filled out the year before and forgotten in the crisis.

She couldn’t stay upright any longer. Thousands of miles away, I slept on, beside my silenced phone. When I ask what I can do, she tells me there is nothing she needs yet. Friends have already brought food, and she is never alone unless she wants to be. She says that the funeral will be on Thursday or Friday; I should start looking for flights. She has to go, some friends want her for something, but she will call me later. I tell her that I love her. There is nothing more to say. After we hang up, I shout for my husband in a voice I have never used before. I don’t know how long I have been crying. Maybe I have been all along. He runs to our room, and I say the words, the words I still can’t believe, for the first time. * * * Stable was what my mother would say, when I asked her how he was doing. Dad would tell me that he
