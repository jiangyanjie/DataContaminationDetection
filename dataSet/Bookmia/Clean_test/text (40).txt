his contact number, practically aching from wishing he’d call, tell me the whole thing had been a mistake. I needed to take the possibility away, to free myself from waiting for it. His eyes go stormy. His lips part. He looks toward the balcony, grooves rising between his eyebrows. He just has one of those vaguely tortured faces, I remind myself. He can’t help it, and he certainly doesn’t need my comfort. He’s the one who derailed our life together in a four-minute phone call. His jaw muscles leap as his pale-fog eyes retrain on me. “What should I have done, Harriet?” Found an excuse. Simply told her no. Not have broken my heart like it was a last-minute dinner plan. Not have made me love you in the first place. I shake my head. He steps closer until he’s a question mark, hanging over me. “I’m really asking.” On a sigh, I drop my eyes and massage my temples. “I don’t know. But now there’s nothing we can do. You can’t break up at a wedding. Especially when the guest list is four people.” “Maybe we give them tonight,” he says. “Celebrate everything, tell them tomorrow.” I look up at the ceiling, buying some time. Maybe in the next four seconds the world will end, and I’ll be spared making this decision. “Harriet,” he presses. “Fine,” I bite out. “I’m sure we can stomach each other for one more night.” His gaze narrows, limiting the intake of light to his eyes and sharpening their focus to better suss out my expression. “Are you sure?” No. “I’m fine,” I say. “It’s fine.” I slump against the edge of the bed.

He retreats a step, keeping the space between us. “We can tell them things have been rocky for a while, and seeing how happy they were made us realize we’ve grown apart.” My chest stings. It’s not the exact phrasing, but it’s close enough to what he said to me, months ago: We were kids when we got together, and things are different now, and it’s time we accepted that. “You honestly think they won’t suspect anything?” “Harriet.” His eyes flash. “They didn’t even know we’d been hooking up for a whole year.” I step backward, only to collide with the bed so hard I rebound right into him. We snap apart like each of us is convinced the other is made of wasps, but the faintly spicy scent of him has already hit my bloodstream. “This might be harder than that,” I say stiffly. Wyn’s hand rakes back through his hair, his T-shirt riding up to expose a sliver of his waist so sensually you’d think there was an art director in the corner barking orders. I force my eyes back to his face. “We can handle one night.” He’s trying to make one night sound like a mere accumulation of minutes. I know better. When we’re together,
