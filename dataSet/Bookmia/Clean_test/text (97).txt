(really?). Georgina Sepulveda, a physics superstar whose work I’ve been stanning for years (I choose to think she collaborated with Jack under duress and donated all proceedings to the local animal shelter). After a minute, I come across the elusive George— George Green. He’s on two low-impact articles—both recent, both with Jack. There’s next to no online trace of him, but he just finished his postdoc at Harvard and posts on physics subreddits under his real name. “Seriously?” This guy’s being interviewed? Whatever strings Jack had to pull, I’m going to cut them one by one with my poultry shears. His mediocre love child doesn’t stand a chance— My phone rings. I jolt and immediately pick up—Greg. Finally. “Hey! I—” “I need your help.” I swallow a groan. “Hi, Mom.” I’ve made a lethal mistake. “The situation is dire. You need to rein in your brothers.” After two and a half decades of APE, I can safely state that the Elsie my mom wants is a droid. She’s powerful, mobile, financially soluble. She successfully quenched her earthly needs and lives in a state of perennial prosperity. Her main purpose is to score prestige points when Aunt Minnie brags about her son who almost finished law school. Her secondary purpose? To intervene when two idiots decide to embark on months-long feuds over stuff that, historically, has included: who gets the front seat in the car who deserves the piece of cake with the frosting bootie at Cousin Jenna’s baby shower who’s taller (they are identical twins) who’s more handsome (see above) whose birth year, according to the Guinness World Records book, has more recorded python attacks (see above!) who gets to pick the dog’s name (we never had pets) This is a noncomprehensive list. Over the years, the feuds have become more rabid, Dad more absent, Mom more reliant on me for cleanups. “You can’t be your family’s janitorial staff,” Cece tells me once a week, but I do my best to make Mom happy, even though of all the Elsies people want, hers is the fakest—and the one with deepest roots. I have, after all, cursed my way into it, tirelessly and painstakingly. “How are you, Mom—” “Overwhelmed. Lucas and Lance are at it again. Almost came to fists after their soccer game.” “Over the result?” “Over Dana.” I rub my temple. “They both agreed to stop dating her.” “They did. But Dana needed a ride somewhere.” “Who did she call?” “Lucas. Lance slashed his tire. The neighbors are starting to talk. You need to stop them.” “I did, Mom. Two weeks ago. A month ago. Three months ago.” I’ve been holding a series of conflict mediation seminars in my parents’ basement. They mostly consist of me reminding my brothers that murder is illegal. “Well, do it again. Come over tomorrow.” I physically cringe. “I’m sorry. It’s not possible.” “Why?” “I—” No. No I statements. Too personal. “This is a stressful, busy time. The semester just started and . . .” Do I tell her? I shouldn’t. But maybe she’ll want to
