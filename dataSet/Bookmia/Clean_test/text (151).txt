the Government, but no one ever believes me. From a young age we’re told office jobs are the goal. Then you sit at a desk hunched over 9–5, 5 days a week for most of your younger years until it’s too late to do anything else but get a “helpful” chair. LG: Why would the government want a nation suffering from back pain? CC: So we don’t take over. I call James that evening, but typically he doesn’t answer and instead calls back hours later. I have to turn the light on as he switches on the video camera. I can see he’s in his car. “Hey, Mads!” He’s got plaits in his hair now and they’re long enough to lie down instead of stick up. When he smiles, his gold tooth glints. Growing up, James and I were always told that we had great smiles—smiles that show perfect teeth and soften our faces. It’s one of the few things we both inherited from Dad. “Dad asleep?” James asks. “Yes, which is why I called,” I tell him. “I could use some help with that. My back hurts from lifting Dad from his seat and into bed. Can you do one of my nights each week maybe?” James scratches what I know to be a phantom itch on the back of his head. “Ah, I can’t really come all the way from Putney just to put Dad to bed, Mads,” he says. “And you know my work schedule is unreliable. It’s not fair to promise you a day and then not come because I gotta be somewhere else last minute.” James’s friend hit the rap-and-grime music scene hard and made it big (I’m talking MOBO and BRIT Awards), so he’s part of that team—chauffeur at times, social media manager, tour companion. Mum jokes he’s a glorified hype man, only there to boost an ego. I think he’s hoping to one day join the music scene himself. “Right.” “Anything else I can help with, though?” he asks. “The council tax bill has come in.” He sighs and scratches the beard growing on his neck. “Sorry, Mads. I’mma bit short on extra money, but remind me next month, yeah?” “Sure … but you’ve been saying that for a couple of months now.” “I know, I know,” he replies, looking away. “Things are just a little tight at the moment. You know I just got back from Japan.” Do you hear yourself? That’s what I want to ask, but instead I mouth: Must be nice. Then say, “Shouldn’t the flight have been paid for since it’s your job?” “Yeah, it was, but I spent too much. I wish I was good with money like you.” “I don’t really have much choice.” I keep my tone light, but I’m not happy. Not so much at the empty money promises, but because I’m reminded he can get away with it. If he says he has no money, short of stealing from his wallet, I have to accept that. He knows I’ll pay the council tax because I’m
