boy took the tea tray and began backing out of the room. “I do,” Miss de Vries said. Her eyes were lizard like, unreadable. Then she added, with a tiny twist in her voice, “Was it considered—an impertinence?” “An impertinence?” “My invitation, my letter to the palace. Did it cause offence?” Something was moving in Miss de Vries’s eyes. Something uneasy. She was doubting herself. “Good heavens,” said Hephzibah. “All approaches to the palace must be considered an offence. To request the attention of Their Royal Highnesses is an impertinence by its very nature. It cannot be helped. Now, tell me, I hear this is a costumed ball, correct?” “Indeed.” “But that is too enchanting. As what shall you go? A Van Dyck? A masked temptress?” Miss de Vries’s smile grew colder. “I shall have to keep it a secret, Your Grace.” “But you must confide in me. I’m dying to know. Will you be a sorceress? A sea serpent? A succubus?” Miss de Vries stared at her. “Oh, don’t let me torture you. I’m being such a gorgon. But tell me you’ll make the papers. Did you go to the Devonshires’ ball?” “I did not.” “No? A pity. It’s helpful to measure the competition, I find. People bore so easily. Have you hired Whitman for the entertainments?” Mrs. King had told her exactly how to put the question. Gently, gently, almost like it was nothing at all... Miss de Vries frowned. “I’ve not heard of Whitman.” Whitman was one of Hephzibah’s greatest gifts to Mrs. King: a costumier and impresario who came from the Rookery in Spitalfields, and who kept a splendid side business in pickpocketing. Between Whitman, Hephzibah and the Janes, there wasn’t a music-hall troupe or traveling fair they couldn’t hire for this job. “Of course you haven’t. He doesn’t advertise.” Hephzibah fiddled in her reticule, drew out a card. “I doubt you’d get him now. Not worth asking. Perhaps next year.” She tossed the card on the table, then sipped her tea. “He does the most stupendous entertainments. And by the by, in case you’re wondering, I did mention your ball to the Princess Victoria.” “You did?” “But of course! She was dreadfully shocked.” Miss de Vries considered this. Said, slowly, “I do not think there is anything about it that should shock Her Royal Highness.” “Oh, but it’s such a deliciously loathsome thing to do! To hold a ball, when you’re in full mourning, not even half. We’re agog with it.” Miss de Vries’s face was immobile. “Have I said something amiss?” Hephzibah patted her on the hand. “Don’t fret. It’s a new century, dear. We’re all ripe for a shake-up. And you needn’t stand on ceremony about HRH. She’s slipping down the pecking order every year, poor thing. One day you’ll be able to drag her to any old bazaar or rose sale you like. I can’t see her making any great marriage, can you?” Hephzibah shifted in her seat. “But for now, of course, things are managed terribly, particularly in her household.” “Of course.” “It’s
