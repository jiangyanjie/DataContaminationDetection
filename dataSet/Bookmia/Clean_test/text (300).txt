onto his lap. “Stop it, Iris,” Roman said, gathering them up as they drifted. As she carelessly crinkled them. “I understand why you’re angry at me, but let me expl—” “How long have you known?” she asked tersely. “When did you know it was me?” Roman paused, his jaw clenched. He continued to gently gather her letters. “I knew from the beginning.” “The beginning?” “From the first letter you sent,” he amended. “You didn’t mention your name, but you talked about your job at the Gazette, the columnist position.” Iris froze in horror, listening to him. He had known all this time? He had known all this time! “I honestly thought it was a prank at first,” he rambled on. “That you were doing it to get in my head. Until I read the other letters—” “Why didn’t you say something to me, Kitt?” “I wanted to. But I was worried you would stop writing.” “So you thought it best to play me for a fool?” His eyes smoldered with offense. “I never once played you for a fool, Iris. Nor did I ever think that of you.” “Were you humoring me, then?” she asked. She hated how her voice trembled. “Was this all some joke to play on the poor low-class girl at work?” She hit a nerve.

He had carried her body home to his parents. A lump rose in her throat. Iris closed her eyes. Roman sighed. “Iris? Will you come here? Sit beside me for a while, and we can talk more.” She needed a moment to herself. To process this snarl of feelings within her. “I need to go, Kitt. Here. Take your letters. I don’t want them.” “What do you mean, you don’t want them? They’re mine.” “Yes! And that’s the other thing you lied to me about!” she said, pointing. “I asked you to send my old letters back. The ones I wrote to Forest. And you said you couldn’t.” “I said I couldn’t, because I didn’t want to,” said Roman. “Did you finish reading my last letter? Although by the looks of it … I don’t think you can even begin to understand what your words mean to me. Even if they were addressed to Forest in the beginning. You were a sister writing to her missing older brother. And I felt
