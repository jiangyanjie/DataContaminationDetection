the bribe Stefan would offer on day one? T7 changes what jail time even means. Taking Stefan down would be a national effort. Even a multinational one. But you can never tell how fast a wall like his will crumble, how many people have been waiting for the moment. Perhaps, with the right moves, it could be done. So maybe I’m supposed to go through with it because I hate everything Tonfamecasca, or maybe someone knows me a little better than that and they think I’d want to put Athena in the top job. Maybe the world actually would be better with Athena in that job, or maybe she’d be worse. You never can tell.

That is to say that Nicky is a sleazeball and a drug dealer who is also a vet. I really do not give a shit about the second one but I have occasionally in my off-season been hired by angry spouses to discover the identity of their wives’ boyfriends. It is always and exclusively wives, and in fact he has a type, which you can imagine as the kind of person who walks a poodle through town in what is effectively swimwear plus a coat. Simultaneously: the kind of person whose husband has particular opinions about what he will do with the guy who is showing his perfect girl a good time behind his back. Which, when it’s
