breaking out the champagne.” Nathaniel. She’d been so busy today that she’d barely thought of him. Meanwhile, he was in Florida procuring her engagement ring. The impulsivity of her actions scared her a little. Perhaps this was what her mother had felt like when she’d been cast in a Broadway show and then been forced to make a choice between her career and having a family. It was all a muddle. “I suppose,” said Marion. Simon paused a moment, studying her, and she tried not to squirm. “Now, tell me, what exactly did you do with yourself today?” It was almost as if he knew she’d been up to something. Luckily, before Marion could come up with a response, Mrs. Hornsby entered carrying a pitcher of water. “What are you still doing here?” said Simon with mock outrage. “Go home already.

Her own choices—waiting around for Nathaniel and spending most of her time at the dance studio—had left her lonely and isolated. She had no one to turn to for advice, right when she needed it most. * * * Marion woke up early and stared at the ceiling. What if Bunny was right, and she’d just shined for that one day, driven by her competitive nature and the need to prove everyone who doubted her wrong? Or what if it was her beauty that had gotten the judges’ attention and landed her the job, not her dancing? If she showed up at the first rehearsal today, she’d find out. And no one needed to know. She figured if Mr. Markert found her dancing subpar and fired her, she’d be able to move on with her life without wondering what might have been. Before she could change her mind, she pulled on her dance clothes, threw a skirt and a sweater over them, and headed out the
