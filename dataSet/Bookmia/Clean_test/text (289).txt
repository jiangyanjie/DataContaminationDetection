study,” said Mrs. Hornsby. “He said to be ready when the car comes at eleven. Let me know if you need help with your hair.” “Thank you, Mrs. Hornsby. I know this is as hard for you as it is for the rest of us.” After drinking a cup of coffee, Marion changed into a black dress. The pearls were back in her jewelry box, and she clasped them around her neck before dissolving into tears. It was probably better that Lucille wasn’t around to have to bear the pain of this day and all the days to come. Would her mother also have considered Marion complicit in the death of her sister? Even though her father hadn’t mentioned that terrible accusation he’d made that night at the hospital, Marion couldn’t help but sense that it simmered just below the surface of their every interaction. Because Judy would never be back. Several times in the past few days, Marion had considered asking Judy’s advice about something, only to remember that she was gone. She’d also realized that with Judy’s death, her sister’s memories of their mother had vanished as well. Being older, Judy had more stored up, and every so often she would offhandedly reveal something about Lucille that Marion didn’t know, like the fact that she adored strawberry milkshakes or that she was scared of horses. Now all that was lost. Marion stared at herself in the mirror. Here she was again, selfishly thinking of herself first. Thinking of the memories she would be denied by Judy’s death, instead of all the things Judy might have done with her own life that were now impossible. Maybe she would’ve met a nice boy and married. Maybe she would’ve been the one with a family while Marion stayed a single girl until her last days. How was it that Judy, who’d never been much of a risk-taker when she was alive, was the sister who had died? She’d never rode in fast cars with boys the way Marion had, or moved to New York, where she might get mugged. Or bombed. No, Marion had put Judy in harm’s way, and deep down, she was certain Simon must still hate her for it. There had to be something she could do to avenge her sister’s death, to honor her memory. She had to find out who did this to her sister and then maybe her father would forgive her. To have lost both of them was too much to bear, especially since she and Judy had finally broached their great divide over the past month and found a common ground. An article in the newspaper echoed what the detectives had already told Marion, with a few added details. The crude homemade bomb had been buried in the upholstery of a seat in the fifteenth row on the right side facing the stage. The mechanism, according to the article, was a one-inch-wide pipe about four inches long, with a simple timer and battery. A seat-by-seat search by the bomb squad produced no other suspicious objects.
