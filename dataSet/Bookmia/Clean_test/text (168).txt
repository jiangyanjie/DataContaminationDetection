why I was so focused on something that would make the whole thing shorter.” He readjusts on the bed, and it’s only then that I realize our knees have been touching. “She should come first, then,” he says. “Before we even have sex.” “Obviously, I’m on board with that. But I have a feeling when you say ‘sex,’ what you really mean is penetration.” I wave a hand around the room. “Everything we do in here—all of it is sex, at least to me. There shouldn’t be just one definition of it, and penetration shouldn’t always be the endgame.” “No, you’re right. That makes sense,” he says. “So you don’t enjoy it at all? Uh . . . penetration?” He runs a sheepish hand down his face. “Just going to put it out there, that’s the most times I’ve heard that word in the course of a single conversation.” I bite back a smile. “I do, but it’s not really the main event for me, the way it might be for you. Or the way I’m guessing it’s been in the past.” He gives me a guilty look. “It’s not like how it is in porn, although there’s some great feminist porn I’d be happy to show you. Or honestly, even in movies and TV. You can’t just mindlessly thrust until both people come, and yet nearly everything you watch is trying its damnedest to convince you otherwise. There’s more finesse to it.” “Not that I take all my sexual cues from porn, I just . . . well, you see it at a ripe-enough age, and some of it sticks with you. That’s probably where my dirty talk came from, too.” Then he looks at me with a new vulnerability. “What if I do all of this, and I still can’t get her there?” “That could very well happen.” “I thought you’d say something like, ‘Absolutely not, Finn, you’ll be a sexual virtuoso in no time.’ ” I toss a pillow at him. “Fine, on the off chance that you’re not—it doesn’t mean your relationship is doomed. You just have to try other things. Toys can be great, and sex doesn’t have to be the destination every time, let alone . . . penetration.” This time I stumble over the word, laughing. There’s no reason it can’t be funny. My knee has fallen back against his, but neither of us moves apart. “There are plenty of fantastic stops along the way—there’s no need to rush it. Or maybe those aren’t stops—maybe those are the main event. It completely depends on the relationship. But the key is communication. That’s the only way to know whether something is working for someone. If one person is unhappy, the other needs to know.” He takes this all in with a focused gaze. “I like that,” he says, his voice dropping into a lower register. Now his hand falls to my knee, thumb rubbing a slow circle. “In fact, I like all of this. I think this was more informative than any health class I had
