her. In photos from that visit, I am a chubby, happy one-year-old in a flowered blouse and a blue corduroy jumper, no longer small for my age, boasting a toothy grin, chipmunk cheeks, and black hair that sticks straight up in defiance of my parents’ styling efforts—no one had ever told them about Asian baby hair. My grandmother, who looks so much like my father with her wide smile, broad nose, and brown hair so dark it could almost be black like mine, reaches toward me as Dad props me up on her hospital bed. He must have known that the trip was an introduction as well as a goodbye. As grieved as he would be when his mother died a few months later, a part of him was relieved that she was finally beyond her pain. * * * When I try to picture my father as he was in my youth, healthy and strong, I see him working a busy lunch or dinner shift, wearing dark pants and a short-sleeved white dress shirt with a name tag pinned to it, chatting with customers. He managed a series of pizza restaurants for most of my childhood, and if I had no school and no one else was available to watch me, sometimes I’d go with him for part of the day. I remember following him into dark industrial kitchens in the predawn chill, watching him check and order inventory. Every now and then I would try to be helpful, wiping down tables or refilling paper-napkin dispensers. It was a special treat to snack on pizza or fries with him when he took a break, especially if he gave me quarters for the jukebox. Dad did everything from cook and clean to serve and operate the cash register; whatever most needed doing in any given moment, that was his job. Working in a restaurant looked fun when I saw him joking with guests, an easy smile on his face, because it was his job to keep them relaxed and happy. As a child, I didn’t see his exhaustion at the end of an open-to-close shift in a week when he’d had no days off. I didn’t know about the abusive customers, the missed breaks and meals, the unpaid overtime and raises that never came through. Sometimes a restaurant would shut down, go bankrupt, or burn down, and he would need to scramble to find another position. I was in my thirties before my mother told me about the opportunities he had missed out on, often given to younger men without families who would be cheaper to promote and relocate. “Isn’t that illegal?” I asked. My mother, who’d come by her pessimism honestly, shrugged and said, “That was always the explanation they gave him.” Anxious about infectious diseases and weary of hospital hours, Mom left respiratory-therapy work behind when I was in grade school. She worked for a few months in my middle-school cafeteria—I remember waving to her from the lunch line on my first day of seventh grade, giving her a hard
