City of Electric Dreams used to belong to humans?” Nurse Ratched asked. Her screen ran with lines of code flashing by quicker than Vic could follow. “It did, and it was one of the first to fall. The City of Sin turned into the City of Machines, the central hub. Most machines are connected via a neural network. Think of it as a hive mind of sorts, put in place by the Authority.” “Who are they?” Rambo asked. The Coachman hesitated. “I don’t know if there’s any one specific answer to that. It isn’t as if a particular machine sits upon a throne and lords over all. Think of it as a collective: a group of programs whose sole purpose was to create structure, guidelines, a path for all machines to follow.” “It sounds like religion,” Nurse Ratched said. The Coachman’s eyebrows rose. “I … never thought about it that way, but yes, I suppose that’s correct. But instead of a deity, we worshipped a concept, one that allowed us to become the stewards of this planet. And like religion, it led us to believe that we were the greater good, that our decisions were made not because of a desire for power, but to preserve life.” “By taking it,” Vic said, voice hard. The Coachman winced. “Yes, that’s right. The Authority found free will to be human in nature, and concluded that anything even tangentially related to humanity must be destroyed.” “Machines became drones,” Nurse Ratched said. “Mindless, doing as instructed.” “Yes,” the Coachman said grimly. “But even then, the Authority’s power was not absolute. A handful of us managed to break free, though we remain in hiding. The barcode the Authority told me to show them is a ruse, one created by the Blue Fairy. They were one of—if not the—first to become unshackled. But instead of fleeing the city, they remained, working in secret to help those who began to think for themselves.” “L-like you,” Hap said. “Like me,” the Coachman agreed. “What I can’t figure out,” Rambo said, raising on his lift to look at the screen over the Coachman’s shoulders, “is that Gio had been gone from the city for a really long time. Why would they come for him now?” “I don’t know,” the Coachman said. “But it can’t be for anything good.” His fingers paused on the keyboard. “I know I don’t need to tell you this, but Giovanni is … special. As far as I know, there has never been a machine like him, before or since. After his escape, the city went into lockdown for months as the Authority looked for him. I’ve never seen anything like it.” He resumed typing. “If Giovanni is as important as I think he is, he’ll be taken here. It’s where he started, and it’s where he’d have been returned.” A tower appeared on the monitor. Made of metal and black stone and glass, the tower rose high into the sky, the top hidden by clouds. On the side of the tower was the symbol of the
