for my friends. They came out here to talk to you about the camp, about its history. We really want to understand, and they figured you’d be the best person to ask.” Her beady eyes narrow and her mouth turns down. “Its history?” Her unkempt brows push up. “What do you know about it? Can’t be too much or you wouldn’t be here.” I try to judge how quickly I can get to the door, but Ms. Keane is positioned almost directly between it and us. “Well, that’s what my friends came here to find out,” I say as I fight to keep my voice steady. “I heard what you said, Ms. Keane. You said we should be ashamed of ourselves, that if we knew what you know, it might mean something. What did you mean by that?” Ms. Keane rocks back and looks up at the ceiling but keeps her fingers curled around the barrel of the shotgun. “That camp is an abomination. Distasteful if you ask me.” She raises her face to the ceiling again. “How?” I ask. “We don’t know what you mean.” I glance at Javier, who looks down into his lap. Bezi slides her hand onto my leg and squeezes it. Hard. Her eyes are wide, and I realize she’s trying to get me to look at something in her line of sight. I follow her gaze to a window at the front of the house. Kyle’s shadowy silhouette is hovering behind the glass.

That’s why you have all these lakes. After the ice melted, the ground opened up like a bunch of starving mouths.” She pauses for a moment before continuing. “Don’t think they were out here when the land was all ice and snow, but the land was here. Sleeping under the ice.” I glance at Bezi, who has a look of utter confusion plastered across her face. “Who is ‘they’?” I ask. Ms. Keane stares at me for a moment without speaking. I feel my stomach drop. I wonder if I’ve made a mistake by asking questions, but she slips back into her rambling. “They didn’t used to have a name at all, I don’t think.” She pushes a loose strand of her greasy hair behind her ear. “Now they’re owls.” Javier makes a small grunt, and Ms. Keane shifts the gun from one hand to the other and back again. “Ever wonder how people come to power?” she asks in a way that tells me she doesn’t expect me to answer. “Seems so random sometimes, doesn’t it? How does a man like that become president? How does a
