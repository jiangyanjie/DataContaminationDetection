a glass door. “I gave you instructions, Cal. You need to understand that. I wasn’t asking a favour. I was telling you what you need to do.” “I don’t work for you, Stefan.” “Of course, you do. Everyone does. Let me remind you who you’re talking to.” The laugh again, long and loud and so close, and I realise he knows what it does, how much it hurts. He leans down into my face, and the waves hit me one by one. He carries on, battering me backwards with just the sound of his contempt until I fall onto the carpet and he stands over me and roars. “I am STEFAN TONFAMECASCA!” If the laughter was bad the shouting is like a kind of death. My ribs flex and my heart skips a beat on each word. The world goes silent, and red: blood vessels breaking in my eyes. I see him watching, face peering into mine as the world falls in around me from the edges, and I go away. * * * — The world comes back slow. I can smell perfume: jasmine mixed with something sporty. Someone’s looking in my eye with a torch. I say: “What?” I hear noise and it hurts, like when you’re a kid and you get an earache. I turn my head and there’s that bubbling sound, and more pain. Low-grade damage, from excessive volume. I say: “Shit.” Speaking hurts too. In fact everything hurts, but nothing hurts the bad way, when you know you’re broken. It just hurts like it fucking hurts. The person with the torch speaks again. They tell me to stay still. They have kind hands. I let them do kind things for a while. “Athena?” “Don’t try to talk, Cal.” Not Athena. A man’s voice, kinda ticked off. “Is she here?” “Cal, it’s Marcus. From St. Helen’s.” Marcus the nurse. “Am I in hospital?” “No, you’re in your apartment. You’re also an idiot. What did I say about washing the lattice?” “Am I going to have a sphincter mark?” “You’ll be lucky if we don’t have to start over, the state of you. Stay still.” I stay still. Marcus works on the putty lattice. I don’t even have enough energy to sass him. Damn it. “Hold this.” I reach out. “Not you, Cal.” “Got it.” A woman’s voice. “Sporty jasmine,” I say. “Is he delirious?” Marcus laughs. “No, honey, that’s you he’s talking about. Keep your eyes closed, Cal, I’m using the curer.” A flash of white purple, long and hot. Bullet hole itches again, feverish, then a hiss as Marcus sprays something topical over the top. “Don’t inhale that or you won’t be able to smell anything for hours. Just let it clear away for a second.” I hold my breath. It’s hard. “And you’re done. You want to open your eyes now, Mr. Detective?” I open my eyes. Marcus looks tired and grouchy, which I figure is where he lives. There’s an open medical bag resting on my night stand and I’m lying looking up at my
