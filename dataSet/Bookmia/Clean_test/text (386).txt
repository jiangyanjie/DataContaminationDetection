so sorry to bother you, but—” “Didn’t you see the signs?” she asks, pulling the door open a little more. Her tone mirrors my own—very sweet and very fake. It immediately sets something off in my gut. It’s almost like she’s mocking me. “The trespassing signs?” I ask. “I’m sorry. I saw them, but I’m looking for my friends, and I know they came this way.” “Do you now?” She pulls the door all the way open but keeps her right hand behind the door itself. “And how do you know that? I haven’t seen anybody.” “You didn’t see anyone?” I ask. Tasha’s hair tie is in my pocket. She was here. “You’re sure? Please, Ms. Keane. I know what happened with you at the camp was probably just a misunderstanding.” I hate placating her this way, but it feels like it’s my only hope of getting any information out of her. “Please. We could really use your help.” There’s a soft click, and before I can move away from the door, Ms. Keane levels her shotgun at my head. I stare down the barrel, and there’s a noise from over my shoulder, a gasp as Bezi and the others register what I’m seeing. “Get in here,” Ms. Keane says. My body begins to tremble so violently, I have to grab hold of the doorframe to keep myself from collapsing. The rush of blood in my ears blurs the noises around me. “Now,” she says. She glances past me. “You too. Get in here.” I walk on unsteady legs into the living room of Ms. Keane’s house. It smells like dust and cat urine. Every square inch of the place is covered in trash. Framed pictures of Jesus hang crooked on the walls, and dozens of cats prance around like they own the place. Bezi and Javier follow me inside. I wait for Kyle to follow, but as I glance back, I realize he’s not there. Ms. Keane slams the door shut and waves the shotgun around in front of me. I wince every time the barrel whizzes past my face. “Can’t leave well enough alone,” Ms. Keane mumbles. “Sit down.” No one moves. She pumps the shotgun once and levels it at me again. We all sit on a musty cat-hair-covered couch as she paces in front of us. “Lemonade?” she asks. “Wha—what?” Javier stammers. “Lem-on-ade,” she repeats, emphasizing every syllable. “Thirsty?” “I—No,” I say. I don’t think even the threat of catching a bullet could get me to drink or eat anything from inside this house. Ms. Keane turns her back to us and lets the gun rest on her hip but keeps her finger close to the trigger. “Is she seriously offering us drinks?” Bezi whispers against my ear. Ms. Keane spins around, and I wince as she points the firearm at us again. “It’s the polite thing to do when you have guests, you know. Offer food, drinks. I’m a little rusty. Don’t have many visitors but I have some lemonade.” Javier stifles a gag. “I think we’re
