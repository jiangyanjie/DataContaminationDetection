broken body is splayed out across the glass. It’s an owl. Its large black eyes are wide open and glassy. They stare into nothingness. Its white-and-gray feathers are ruffled, and its talons are curled into tight knots. It’s uncomfortably familiar. Rob must have had a hundred jobs over the years I’ve known him, and I think he brought home a little souvenir from every place he’d either quit or been fired from. My room is storage for his collection of failures. Reams of paper from his time at the paper mill sit stacked in the corners. Scrap metal from the recycling center is piled in bins under my window. But the worst thing he ever brought into the house were the taxidermic birds. There were some peregrines and kestrels, other birds of prey, but his favorite were the owls. They lined the shelves in my closet and sat perched on every free inch of space on my dresser. They all have the same dead eyes as the one I’m looking at now. Staring down into the skylight, I see only my reflection. The glass is meant to see out, not in. I look a mess and quickly move to get the owl off the glass. I prod the owl’s lifeless body off the skylight and nudge it down the slope of the roof, where it finally falls over the edge and into the shrubbery below. Disposing of dead animals isn’t in my job description, but I do it often. There is always something dying in the woods or in the lake. I make my way back down the ladder, and Bezi meets me as I hop off the last rung. “Where is it?” she asks. “I knocked it into a bush.” Bezi’s face twists up. “You just threw it off the side of the roof?” I interlace my fingers on top of my head and sigh. “I’m sorry? I don’t know what else I’m supposed to do.” She stomps off into the bushes and returns a few moments later cradling the dead bird, bits of leaves and grass clinging to her clothes and hair. “Gross!” Paige says as she steps out onto the porch. “What are you doing?” Bezi huffs. “You’re so insensitive. We can’t just leave it in the bushes.” “Babe,” I say. “It’s—it’s dead. Just leave it out there.” Bezi looks at me like I’m insulting her personally. “I want to bury it.” “We’re not having a funeral for an owl, Bezi.” Paige shoves her hand down on her hip. “You have lost your entire mind. Throw it in the woods and come back inside.” Bezi rolls her eyes and sets the dead bird in the grass just off the pathway. I put my arms around her, and she leans her head on my shoulder. “I can’t just leave it,” she says quietly. I kiss her cheek and pull her close. “It’s okay. I get it.” Bezi wears her heart right on her sleeve. Her mom’s a veterinarian and her dad was a park ranger. If it flies, swims, or
