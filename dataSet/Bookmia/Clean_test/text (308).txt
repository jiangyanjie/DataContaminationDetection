tomorrow. Then all that’ll be left is locking everything up and closing the office and control center. Everybody pitches in. We get it done and get home. Deal?” “Deal,” says Kyle. “I’m ready to get up outta here.” “Same,” says Porter. “Let’s go.” CHAPTER 7 We spend the morning cleaning cabins—stripping the sheets and blankets and stuffing them into watertight storage bags, making sure all the windows are closed and locked. When I shut off the main breaker, the electricity to the whole place will go out, so that gets saved for last. Me and Bezi drag canoes out of the lake and stack them against the side of the boathouse. I can’t help but think about what I saw by the lakeside, but the sooner we get everything done the sooner we can leave. Porter helps Kyle take out the trash; Tasha and Paige cover the firepit and sweep out the stripped-down cabins. Javier helps us bring all our personal belongings into the Western Lodge. I’m helping Bezi sweep out the storage shed when Javier waltzes past with an armful of blankets and pillows. “What about the big cabin?” he asks. I tilt my head back and let a long breath hiss out from between my lips. “I completely forgot about that,” I say. “We gotta strip down another staff cabin?” Bezi asks. “Jordan, Heather, and Felix were bunking together in one of the bigger cabins on the west side of camp. I completely forgot.” Bezi huffs. “We can probably knock it out if we head over there now.” I nod, and we make our way to the guest cabins that are situated down a steep slope behind the main office. The cabins in this part of camp sleep eight, and we only use them once or twice a season when big groups come to play the game. Bezi and I cut through the thick grass and climb the steps of Cabin #6. The curtains in the front window are partway open, and I try to peer inside, but the screen is thick with dirt and dead bugs. I try the door, but it’s locked. “You have a key?” Bezi asks. “Don’t really need one,” I say. “It’s a twist lock.” I turn the handle hard to the right and shoulder check the door. It pops open. The smell knocks me back immediately. I quickly cover my nose and mouth with my hand, and Bezi gags. “Oh my god, what is that smell?” she asks, her eyes watery. I pull my shirt up over my nose and scan the room. Sitting on the wooden table in the center of the room is a plate of food. Chicken breast, broccoli, and rice. I try to remember when we had that meal. I remember the broccoli tasting like garbage so I dumped mine. It had to have been this past Thursday, which also happened to be the last time all the staff were on shift and accounted for. The food is rotted and crawling with gnats and flies. I stifle the urge to
