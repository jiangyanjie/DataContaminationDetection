every item in the de Vries house on Park Lane. Nearly every item. You girls—” she nodded to the Janes “—are going to need to fill in the gaps.” Jane-one raised her pencil into the air. “What for, Madam?” “Don’t call me Madam. Call me Mrs. King.” “What for, Mrs. King?” “Because we’re going to take the items listed and sell them.” Mrs. King gave them a smile. “I don’t intend to miss a thing.” Jane-two crossed her arms. “How much are you selling?” “Everything, darling,” said Hephzibah, reaching for the dessert trolley, swiping a lemon pudding. “Am I right?” “Quite right.” Mrs. Bone rubbed her chin. “Fantastical.” “Risks later,” said Mrs. King. “Maneuvers first. The job will be executed on the twenty-sixth of June. Mark the date in your diaries, ladies. Alice, tell us what’s happening that night.” Alice started, but found her voice. “There’s going to be a ball.” “A ball?” said Hephzibah, licking her lips. Mrs. King opened her arms wide. “A costumed ball, ladies. The most magnificent party. The kind you’ll tell your grandchildren about. It will be, I can tell you, a right knees-up.” Mrs. Bone pursed her lips. “While their precious master’s still warm in his grave?” “Life goes on, Mrs. Bone.

A quarter of the goods can be put into safekeeping before the first guests even arrive.” She nodded to her sister. “Alice won’t be the only new arrival on Park Lane. They’ve got a big staff but a ball on this scale requires an even bigger one. I’ve lined up all the appropriate posts: house-parlormaids, daily women, et cetera. Mrs. Bone, if we can count on your resources, we’ll be able to get people expediting our affairs on every floor of the building.” She looked at Hephzibah. “And with your talents, Hephz, we’ll be providing half the guests, and all of the entertainment. They’ll be really rather critical: moving people around is important. Our estimates are that we’ll commence the full clearance at midnight.” “Our estimates?” said Mrs. Bone, sending a piercing gaze across the room. “I’ve gone over the timings, Mrs. Bone,” said Winnie helpfully. “In great detail.” “Nobody knows this house better than Winnie Smith,” said Mrs. King smoothly, before Mrs. Bone could speak. She patted the Inventory. “Believe me.” Mrs. Bone folded her arms. “And I s’pose you’d be expecting my fences to get the stuff moving?” “Every van you’ve got, Mrs. Bone,” agreed Mrs. King. “Every carthorse, come to that.” “Have some donkeys,” said Mrs. Bone. “There’s a few in this room.” She shook her head, tutting. “You don’t rob a place when there’s a party going on.
