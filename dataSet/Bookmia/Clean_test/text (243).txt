I ask. He nods. “I don’t have that kind of money, Wyn.” “I know,” he says. “That’s not what I meant.” “I couldn’t take something like that for free,” I say. “It’s going really well, Harriet,” he says. “And I hardly have any expenses right now—maybe you’ve heard: I live with my mom?” I laugh. “I think I remember reading that on TMZ.” He touches my hand against the hood, and god help me, I turn my palm up to his. I need to hold on to him right now, need to feel the calluses I’ve memorized on his palm. “I would love to make you one,” he murmurs. “I’ve got time, and I don’t need money.” Reading my expression, Wyn says, “Or if you don’t want one . . .” “It’s not that.” I shake my head. “It’s amazing. Seeing you like this. So happy.” He studies me for a beat before dropping his gaze on a nod. “I am. I’m really happy.” Now my chest is folding over on itself. “I’m so glad.” “You too, right?” He matches my gaze.

His mouth hitches, an unconvincing quarter smile. “Looks like our time’s up.” It already was, I think. But the pain, it still feels fresh. 28 DARK PLACE SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA AFTER HANK’S DEATH, Wyn insists we don’t have to postpone. He says we shouldn’t lose the venue or the deposit money. But he’s barely eating, hardly sleeping. “It will be easier this way,” I tell him. “I’ll have more time to adjust to the residency, and then we can figure everything else out.” Months go by, and his grief doesn’t abate. Mine hovers close too, always waiting to trip me up. Everything still makes me think of Hank, of what Gloria must be feeling, what Wyn must be keeping inside. Something as innocent as a car commercial can split me open. I start taking long showers so I can let it all out without piling my pain onto his. Wyn starts taking long runs to burn it all off. We don’t paint the apartment. One weekend he offers, but between his two jobs, it’s his one day off, and he looks so tired. “We’ll get to it eventually,” I say. “I’m sorry,” he croaks, grabbing me by the hips, pulling me toward where he sits on the couch, burrowing his face into my stomach. “You have nothing to be sorry for,” I promise. “I want
