for a few days.” He looked over at Simon once more, as if asking for backup. Simon nodded sagely. “Nothing wrong with a quick golf trip. After all, you haven’t seen your buddies all summer, right?” “He went to Europe with his buddies,” said Marion. “What are you not telling me?” Judy, who’d been silent all this time, not even offering up a word of congratulations, piped up from the corner. “You’re ruining everything, Marion. Just be quiet.” “How? I don’t understand.” The three of them were ganging up on her, gaslighting her; something was afoot and she wanted to be in on the joke. Maybe she was overreacting, but she’d just lost her job and was now being almost proposed to by her almost-fiancé, and she didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. “Tell me.” “Nathaniel is going to see his grandmother in Florida to collect your engagement ring,” Judy said, clearly thrilled to spill the beans once again.

There would be a guest list to draw up, invitations to order, meetings with florists. It was a lot of work ahead. Her heart felt heavy at the thought of it for some reason. “I remember your mother was overwhelmed at first as well,” said Simon. “That’s perfectly normal. I’ll tell you what, though, I can’t wait to walk my little girl down the aisle.” Her normally stoic father was about to cry, which, in turn, made Marion’s eyes well up. All her annoyance dissipated. She walked over to her father and gave him a peck on the cheek. “Tell us again how you and Mom met.” A soft smile crossed his face. “I’ve told you that before.” Judy piped up. “She was reading a play, right?” The two sisters shared a quiet glance, united in their thirst for details about their lost parent. “That’s right.
