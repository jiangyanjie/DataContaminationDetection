you’re not that machine anymore. You don’t need a heart for me to see that.” “F-forgiveness.” He’d never heard that word from Hap before. Strange, then, that Vic and the Coachman had been talking about exactly that. “You were listening?” Hap said, “To Gio? Yes. In the g-ground h-house. B-before. He said fforgiving others could be difficult, but f-forgiving yourself c-can sometimes feel impossible.” Of course he did. Of course Dad said that. His own memories hadn’t been wiped, not like Hap’s. He’d spent his entire time in the forest with the knowledge of what he’d created, what he’d allowed to happen. His programming, his purpose. And then he’d lived for decades trying to … what? Make sense of his decisions? Seek atonement for all that he’d done? And that had led to Victor. Dad’s grief and pain and anger over causing death made him create life. Wasn’t that selfish? Wasn’t that putting a bandage over a leaking, rotting wound? “Did he find forgiveness?” Vic asked, unsure if such a thing could even exist. “I d-don’t know. I didn’t have t-time to ask him.” Time. Forgiveness. “Oh.” Hap grunted. He dropped his hands on the railing as he looked out into the desert. Out of the corner of his eye, Vic watched as Hap moved his hand slowly toward Vic’s own.

You are a-alone. I w-won’t let you be lonely and make another V-victor. One is s-sufficient.” He blinked against the burn in his eyes. “Oh, so long as I’m sufficient.” “Ha, ha. That was a j-joke. I was joking.” Vic snorted. And so there they stood, one man and one machine under an infinite field of stars, the desert flying by in front of them as they hurtled toward the unknown. Behind them, the road led back into darkness, the ashes of their home. But home didn’t have to be a place. Something righted itself in Vic’s chest. He had made his choice. “The City of Electric Dreams used to be known as the City of Sin,” the Coachman said. He sat in front of his computer, fingers flying over the keys, the others crowded behind him. One of Nurse Ratched’s tentacles was attached to a port at the bottom of the monitor. “The humans traveled there to lose all their money under the brightest lights. Many had dreams of striking it rich, but most left with less than when they had arrived.” “That seems senseless,” Rambo said. “Indeed,” the Coachman said. “The City of Electric Dreams used to belong to
