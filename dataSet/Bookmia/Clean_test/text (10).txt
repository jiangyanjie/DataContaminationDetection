and it takes me a moment to realize Kyle must have cued up the sound effects. The hidden speakers cycle through screams and menacing footsteps. The sounds seem to be coming from every direction. Bezi takes my hand and pulls me toward the showers, and we’re mounting the front steps before the men give chase again. We slam the door shut and wedge a trash can under the handle. With a loud bang, the men collide with the door. The can scrapes across the ground, and the gray-haired man slips his arm through the crack in the door and attempts to move it. I reach in my pocket and pull out the half-empty can of bear spray. I angle it toward the opening in the door and empty the canister directly into the faces of the two men. They immediately start to cough and gag, and I scramble back as a residual cloud of the noxious gas wafts into the shower building. My throat burns and my eyes water uncontrollably. Bezi coughs so hard, she almost vomits. I run to the sink and turn on the water, flushing my eyes and mouth. There’s a loud bang, and I spin around to see the angry faces of both men as they shove the door open a little more. My mind runs in circles. The windows in the shower room are for venting only. They’re high and narrow and impossible to climb through. There’s no back door. “What—what do we do?” Bezi stammers, a trail of spittle hanging from her chin, the whites of her eyes bloodshot. I flush my eyes again, but my vision is blurry, my throat raw. “Push harder!” screams the gray-haired man. “I’ll kill her!” My face feels like it’s been exposed to an open flame, but in the wash of pain and fear, my nights of playing the final girl at Camp Mirror Lake give me a way out. “The trapdoor,” I say. Bezi wipes her face with her shirt. “Huh?” “Come on.” I grab her and duck into the last stall. There’s no toilet there, just a rusted metal wall locker with a sign that says Storage hanging on the front. “We’re gonna hide?” Bezi asks. “They already know we’re in here!” I pull open the door and stare down into the darkened hole below. I push Bezi toward it, and she quickly shimmies down the ladder that leads to the second hidden tunnel. This one goes from the showers to the arts-and-crafts lodge on the south side of the camp. The tunnel is twice as long and unlit, but it’s the only option we have. The sound of wood splintering splits the air, and the two men fall into the shower building, tripping over themselves and shouting. The gray-haired man rushes me before I can get down the ladder and into the tunnel. He grabs me by the front of my shirt and slams me back against the wall. Pain rockets through my shoulder as the man’s rancid breath blows into my nose and mouth. He smiles
