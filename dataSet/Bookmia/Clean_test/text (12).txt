footing. You know how much the food will cost, in case chivalry is dead, you know the dress code and the ambience of the place. And, for extra measure, make sure you tell at least one friend or family member who you’re meeting, where you’re going and what time you expect to return—you know, just in case! “Watch it!” A man and his briefcase push into me and give me a dirty look (the man, not the briefcase) before walking on. My fault for stopping in a stream of pedestrian traffic, but in my defense—if anyone cared to ask—I’d just discovered that Ben could be a potential serial killer and I his next victim. I move aside and stand in the entranceway of a closed bank. Google: Is a first date at his house normal? Nicole91: So I met this guy at a coffee shop and we really hit it off. After we exchanged numbers he sends me a text asking if I’d like to have dinner with him at his place. I’ve only met him once and we got on well but I don’t really know him. I like him though and he seems like a genuinely good guy. Should I go to his house for dinner? SarahTK: Ted Bundy seemed like a genuinely good guy too. Kathy78: I think it’s okay to go to a man’s house on a 1st date but only if you trust him. Anon: Trusting him doesn’t mean anything. We’ve all been duped before.

If I was a murdering sociopath that’s how I’d do it. #justsaying #savethewhales #seriouslyguysourplanetisdying Simone_G: I think a first date at his house is a sign of maturity because he’s not afraid to show you where he lives. It means he wants something long-term. Just let him know that your friends know where you are. Leela: Run girl. Run far and run fast. Helpful. Back to Lisa Fiener. Conversation: being caught off guard or stuck in awkward silence is the bane of every first date. It’s bound to happen if you don’t know each other very well, or even if you’ve exhausted all your get-to-know-you questions beforehand. To combat this, you’ll want a list of things you can talk about to keep the conversation flowing. Here are my top three conversation starters: Given the choice of four people in the world, dead or alive, who would you invite to a dinner party? What’s your most treasured memory?
