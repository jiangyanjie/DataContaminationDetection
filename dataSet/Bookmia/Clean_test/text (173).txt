. .” He takes a soft, cozy black hat and slides it over my head. It’s not mine, but it feels great. And apparently I’m not awake enough to insist that I don’t need a ride and button up my coat at the same time. “It’s fine, I can even take an Uber and . . .” He notices my shaking hands and gently brushes them away to do my buttons himself. “Elsie, it’s fine. I get it. You don’t want me to take you out.” He gets to the highest button. His knuckles brush against my downturned chin. “At least let me take you home.” • • • J ACK ’ S A CONFIDENT DRIVER , RELAXED EVEN IN BAD WEATHER conditions, with the roads not quite clear and other cars swaying. I sink into the heated seat he turned on for me and remember the time I swerved to avoid a squirrel, almost causing a multivehicle crash. The squirrel turned out to be a Wendy’s paper bag, but it’s fine. I’m good at other things. Probably. “Feel free to pick up,” I say, pointing at Jack’s phone.

It’s considering a commemorative bench when the front door opens to the cruel, menacing, cutthroat glory of the most terrifying Smith. Millicent. “Well, well, well,” she singsongs, standing cross-armed. She’s wearing simple black pants and a cardigan, but even in a casual outfit there’s something intensely matriarchal about her. I cannot picture her ever having been anything but ninety and rich. “Look who’s not dead.” “You know,” Jack says from my side, in that ever-amused tone of his, “I have many regrets in life.” “I’m certain you do.” “But teaching you how to text is the biggest.” Millicent waves her hand. “When you were three, I had to drive you to the ER because you stuck a purple crayon up your butthole.
