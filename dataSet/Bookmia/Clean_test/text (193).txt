Ogden countered. Marion didn’t like the way this was going already. “Is Captain Somers around?” Ogden regarded her with a glower. “No. He’s out trying to put out the fire you two set off with your ‘profile.’ We’ve been slammed ever since we fed the information to the press. Everyone and their mother are calling with tips, either turning in some neighbor who kicks his dog or a co-worker who rubbed them the wrong way.” This was a man who was determined to be unhappy no matter what, it seemed. “Isn’t it a good thing that you have something to work with, after sixteen years?” Marion asked. “Define ‘good.’ ” Peter touched Marion on the arm. “Show him the letter.” She placed it on the table. Ogden reached into his desk and put on a pair of rubber gloves. “You got this today?” Marion nodded. “It’s fairly obvious it’s not him,” repeated Peter. Marion stopped herself from nudging Peter in the ribs. Ogden disliked them both, and tossing out his opinion before the man even had a chance to study the letter was sure to put him off. “Why don’t you think it’s the Big Apple Bomber?” asked Ogden, measuring out the words. “It’s not signed F.P. like the others; he uses Met Power instead of Metropolitan Power. And the fact that it’s typed.” “He’s typed letters before.” Ogden examined the postmark. “Westchester again. Well, that’s consistent.” “But as I’ve said before, I don’t think he lives in Westchester,” said Peter. “He’s smarter than that; he wouldn’t mail the letters from where he lives.” “You can’t know that for sure.” Ogden sat back in his chair, arms folded. “In fact, I’ve already ordered our team to get handwriting samples from every Met Power employee who lives in Westchester County. They’re checking driver’s license applications, jury lists, pistol permits, judgments, court files. It’s a huge undertaking, but we’re getting close.” He rose and picked up the letter from his desk. “I’m going to get this fingerprinted.” “None of the other letters had fingerprints,” said Peter. “Maybe he’s getting lazy.” “Do you mind if we wait?” asked Marion. Since it was her week off from Radio City, she didn’t have to worry about the time. “Whatever suits you.” After he left, Marion turned to Peter. “I know he’s a jerk, but maybe you could ease up a bit.” “Ease up? The sheer stupidity of this investigation is maddening.” “But if you push too hard he’ll exclude us entirely. He’s already resentful of all the tips your profile is bringing in.” “Somers seems to have a good head on his shoulders, but this Ogden is a pill. The tips are a gold mine. Why Ogden’s wasting time scouring Westchester is beyond me.” “I couldn’t agree more. But we need him to keep us in the loop with what’s going on with the case, so for now, try not to sock him in the nose.” “Was it that obvious?” Marion couldn’t help but laugh. “Somewhat.” Eventually, Ogden returned, a triumphant smile on his face. “We got
