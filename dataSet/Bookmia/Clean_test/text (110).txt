a cop are you tonight?” “You know exactly how much of a cop I am. What’s going on?” She sighs. “I burned down the lab,” she says, and we turn the corner. 4 This is how much of a cop I am. A long time ago when I first started working with the department there was a moment when maybe Musgrave and I might have had something. I’d blown in from—well, never mind. I did some fairly crazy things after Athena got her first dose, and I made some surprising friends. Musgrave and I were younger, dumber and hotter. We weren’t dating and we weren’t sleeping together, but we were thinking about it and we both knew that. I went to Musgrave’s house one night because she called me. It wasn’t the kind of call that says to shower before you go. I went anyway. I found her ex’s brain on the wall and the rest of him on the hall carpet. I found Musgrave holding the gun. She wouldn’t call the department. She wouldn’t say why. I found out later his brother was a captain in another town. I thought about what to do for about five seconds and realised I didn’t care.

It has indoor-outdoor pools in the main garden and wooden hot tubs by the cabins among the trees. Back another three hundred metres there’s a section they don’t put in the brochure where what comes up out of the rock is mostly acid. The pools there look every bit as beautiful, but you really don’t want to bathe in them. A guy named Marlowe keeps the grounds and makes sure no one goes in. Marlowe and I get along fine. I never talk to Musgrave about that night and she never brings it up. Everyone assumes we slept together. Everyone assumes it was bad sex and we didn’t want to do it any more. They mostly assume that last part was my fault. * * * — I drive us to her house. I have only ever been inside that one time. Musgrave has a little remote on the dash and the garage door opens. I drive in. Musgrave heats a tin of
