months ago. So why did I feel as if I were falling, tumbling through empty air, with nowhere to land? I heard her say that there was a new growth, larger than the one before, in her abdomen. There was another tumor in her spine, and “spots” in her liver and lungs that were likely new lesions. She didn’t say the words terminal or stage 4. She didn’t have to. Still, my mind struggled against the truth. “What does this mean?” I asked, almost pleading. “I’m sorry, but can you tell me what this means?” She said, “I think it means I’m going to die,” and then she began to cry. A memory came to me: I was a child, eight or nine, lying awake in my room while a babysitter watched television in our living room. I wasn’t in my bed, but curled up in a roll of blankets on the carpet, because at that age I would often lie on the floor when I was too anxious to sleep; there was something about that firmness and resistance, the feeling of all my limbs, my entire small frame, pressing into solid ground, that made me feel safer. No matter how late the hour, I could never fall asleep until my parents got home. What if they lost control of their car in the rain? I used to wonder, on those sleepless nights when I waited to hear their car in the driveway, their voices in the hall. What if they’re lying in a ditch right now? What will I do without them?

Had I just made her tell me that she was dying? I shouldn’t have asked. I shouldn’t have made her say the words. I hadn’t known it was possible to feel so frantic and so utterly empty, panic clanging in a hollow bell. I tried to think of something, anything to say that might be a comfort—I heard myself making pointless promises, saying that she should call me anytime she wanted; that Dan and I would help; that we loved her and would do whatever we could. I won’t be useless to you the way I was to Dad, I thought. After she had hung up, I huddled on the floor, pressing my palm to the ache that had bloomed deep in my chest. That was where Dan found me a few moments later. From the anguished look on his face, I could tell that he knew what my mother had told me—our house isn’t large, and wails travel easily through the vents. I didn’t ask him if our kids had heard me crying. I didn’t ask if they were worried. The only child I could think about was me. He
