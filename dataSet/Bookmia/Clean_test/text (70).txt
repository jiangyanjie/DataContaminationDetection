understood!” Simon walked toward Marion, holding one palm out. “Hand them over.” Marion’s hand flew up to the pearls around her neck. This was Simon’s punishment whenever she disobeyed or disappointed, by staying out longer than curfew or getting a D on a physics test back in high school. The pearls would be taken away for seven days. He knew how much they meant to her, that they had once belonged to Lucille. “That’s not fair.” “Marion.” Reluctantly, Marion unclasped the pearls and dropped them into his hand. She stepped back, trying not to cry. “None of this makes any sense. What would it matter if I had become a professional ballerina? It would be a paying job, just like Judy takes home a salary.” “Judy has a job that is serious, with benefits and long-term growth. Being a dancer would have provided neither of those things.” “But it would have made me happy.” His tone softened. “I know you don’t understand now, but you will later, I promise. When you’re married to Nathaniel and have a child of your own, you’ll see that sometimes your wisdom trumps their wishes. That’s the job of being a parent. I want more than anything to see you safe and taken care of.” He held out his arms, expecting her to fall into them. “Trust me, my dear. I only wish your mother was here to explain it better.” Simon had never remarried—his devotion to his dead wife was that strong—and Marion knew he missed her terribly. Still, he couldn’t keep Marion and Judy in a bubble, safe from harm, forever. That wasn’t fair to them. Marion ran upstairs, away from her father’s searing compassion and the stricken look on her sister’s face. Her bed was covered with dance magazines and pointe shoe ribbons. She swept them off with one hand and threw herself facedown on the quilt, but the tears wouldn’t come. One of the magazines lay on the floor, splayed open. A photograph showed a row of dancers dressed in red. Marion recognized the Rockettes kick line instantly. She leaned out and grabbed it, turning onto her back to read the article. It was all about tomorrow’s auditions: where to go, what to bring, what to expect. Tomorrow, Nathaniel would be in Florida, and her father and Judy would be at work. Meanwhile, Marion would be moping around her childhood bedroom, fretting over being fired and wondering what might have been. There was no way for her to travel back in time and audition for the School of American Ballet, but perhaps that didn’t mean all was lost. What if, for one day, she pursued a path that she’d thought was closed—followed in her mother’s footsteps and took a chance? Instead of tamping down her passion for dance, as her father and Nathaniel wanted, what if she struck out on her own and joined the hundreds of dancers hoping to become a Rockette at Radio City Music Hall? If she failed and was laughed out of the room, she’d at least know that
