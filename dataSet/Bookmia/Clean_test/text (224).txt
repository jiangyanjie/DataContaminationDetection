being reminded to sit up straight and keep their cameras on. Their world had shrunk to the four walls of our house, our yard, and the neighborhood we meandered through day after day. We knew that we were luckier than many. We were trying our best. But none of us were doing well, and the first long pandemic winter was on the way. This dog, I decided, was going to be the family comfort animal. The kids picked out a name together and refused to consider any others. It was my lap that Peggy curled up on to sleep during the drive home, firmly rejecting the blanket-and-newspaper-lined cardboard box we’d brought with us. By the time she came along to throw our entire household into joyful chaos, several more families we knew had gotten dogs. One went “just to look” at a litter of puppies and wound up bringing one home on the same day we got Peggy, without so much as a dog bed or food bowl ready. Holdouts teased us for giving their children fuel for their own pandemic pet campaigns. “Way to make it that much harder for the rest of us,” one friend said. “I want my kid to meet your puppy, but also my kid should never meet your puppy.” We had no regrets, even on days when Peggy woke us before dawn and soiled the floor every twenty minutes. She followed us from room to room, searching for someone to cuddle with when she wanted to sleep—I’d never met a needier being, yet she seemed convinced that she was taking care of us, not the other way around. She would often nap under the kids’ desks during their endless school Zoom days, near enough to be stealthily petted. One day I came into the living room to find our twelve-pound puppy exuberantly chasing my older child in circles around our coffee table, and I realized it was the first I’d heard her deep belly laugh in weeks. Nearly every other time I’d witnessed someone’s happiness or glee in the months since my mother’s death, I felt as though I were viewing it through a thick sheet of glass—though I might smile or laugh along, the emotion itself remained indistinct, inaccessible to me, something I could see and remember but not feel, at least not fully. The joy on my daughter’s face as Peggy scampered after her stood out so clear and sharp and bright, it was as if I could reach out and grab ahold of it. * * * I don’t remember when or why I first began to pay attention to my mother’s anxiety. At some point I realized that talking with her sometimes made me more anxious, but it wasn’t clear to me why; like me, she was someone I thought of as a worrier, but it wasn’t as if she were always catastrophizing when we talked. She had a hard time with silence, I noticed, and couldn’t help but try to fill it, which sometimes meant a jarring topic shift or slightly
