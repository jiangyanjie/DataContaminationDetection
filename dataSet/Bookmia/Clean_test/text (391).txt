police didn’t question him after the murders?” “They couldn’t. Ricardo Mayhew was gone. After that night, he was never seen again.” Carter eyes me over his glass, waiting for my reaction. I respond appropriately, my jaw dropping in surprise. “And his wife—” “Berniece.” The name jars my memory. Lenora mentioned her in passing. Berniece was the kitchen maid who wished her a half-hearted happy birthday. “She never saw him again, either?” “Nope.” “And she had no idea where he went or what happened to him?” “None,” Carter says. “She’s still around, though. Most folks say she never left town because she’s waiting for her husband to return. It’s more likely the poor woman has nowhere else to go.” “So you think Ricardo Mayhew murdered the rest of the Hope family and then ran?” “That’s my guess. Short of Lenora killing them, it’s the only thing that makes sense.” “But why would the groundskeeper want to kill Winston Hope and his family?” “I don’t know,” Carter says. “Why would Lenora?” A fair point. One I’m still trying to understand myself. But Carter didn’t just spend the entire day helping her type. He didn’t read about the bloody nightgown. Or Lenora tossing a knife into the ocean. Or leaving the terrace to get rope that, I assume, was later tightened around her sister’s neck. And even though I want to tell him all those things, I don’t. It seems wrong to mention anything until I learn the whole story. Only then will I spill any details. I think that’s what Lenora ultimately wants—for me to be the voice she doesn’t have. Even if what I’m saying is her long-delayed confession. “If you’re right—and that’s a very big if—it still doesn’t make sense. Why wouldn’t Lenora say anything? If Ricardo killed her parents and her sister, why wouldn’t she tell that to the police?” Or to me, for that matter. So far, she hasn’t once typed the name Ricardo Mayhew. If she thought he did it, why wasn’t that the first thing she wrote? Instead, she began when, to use her phrasing, it was all but over. “Maybe she didn’t know,” Carter suggests. But Lenora did know her parents were dead. She told me so. They were dead and her nightgown was bloody and she threw the knife over the terrace railing despite knowing it was evidence of two brutal crimes. Why would she do that if she wasn’t the one who had used it? I finish my drink, my thoughts rattling like the ice in my now-empty glass. In that tumbling mental chaos, a new theory takes shape. One I can’t share with Carter. Not just yet. “I need to go,” I say, standing suddenly. “Thanks for the drink.” Carter watches in confusion as I give a quick wave goodbye, leave the cottage, and cross the damp lawn. On the terrace, I watch for shingles underfoot and steer clear of the railing. Only when I’m under Lenora’s window do I risk an upward glance. Although her room is still dark and nothing appears at
