library?” I almost spit my ayran all over her. But it’s okay because she totally deserves it. 19 IMPEDANCE O N F RIDAY NIGHT , I WEAR A DRESS . Nothing fancy. It’s a cable-knit sweaterdress my cousin handed down to Mom because it was too long, and Mom handed down to me because it was too small. I pair it with my one lipstick, my one tube of mascara, my one eye pencil, my one pair of thigh highs. I curl my hair all on my own, cursing softly whenever I burn the side of my hand, so Cece won’t hear. Reader: she hears anyway. “This is such an M.

And I might be later than that, but I’m not spending the night.” “Ever?” “Ever.” She gasps. The spoon clatters. “Are you not letting him smack the salmon because of the article he wrote? Is his seventeen-year-old self cockblocking him from the past?” I frown—at her usage of salmon and at the reminder that why, yes, the guy I’m going out with did do that.
