not to rest but to get other things done: doctor appointments, washing my hair, immigration office visits when we realized Dad’s visa had expired. Even yesterday saw me cleaning the house and sorting through bills whenever Dad slept. God, I can’t tell Mum I’ve been fired. There exists no greater shame in her mind than forced unemployment. She’d think it was my fault because there’s always a reason someone is fired. What reason do I give her? A missed invite in Katherine’s calendar that I didn’t even accept? She’d never believe me. Understandably. Because aren’t you supposed to get fired for atrocities like sleeping with the married boss, embezzling money or, you know, murder? All that had died in that office was my will to live; all I did was … I’m still not clear on what I did or didn’t do, but I know it didn’t warrant immediate dismissal. I still had my midmorning snack in my bag. Had I even taken my jacket off since I shrugged it on this morning? I shuffle on the spot before heading back into the train station. I sit and wait for the 9:33 A.M. train. I have never gotten on the 9:33 A.M. train. At least the carriages will be empty. Google: What to do when you’ve been fired Shit! You’ve been fired!

Start budgeting—because, let’s face it, you’re broke now, or at least will be once you realize your next paycheck won’t come until after interviews, job acceptance, and a full month of employment. I try a different search result. What to do after you’ve been fired Ask for a written and signed statement explaining your termination Seek unemployment benefits Have faith in yourself and your future I place a damp hand on my forehead to cool it down. A text message rolls down my phone screen from an unsaved number. Hi Maddie. It’s Ben from the other night. How have you been? Ben. Of course this is when he’d decide to text me. Then I remember the flat I’ve just paid the deposit and first month’s rent for. I can’t deal with all of this right now. I switch off my phone and take a deep breath. “Fuck.” I exhale. The man in a suit sitting two seats from me with grease on his tie looks up from his before-10:00 A.M. burger and says, “Same.” Chapter Six Let’s just pause here and take a second to look at
