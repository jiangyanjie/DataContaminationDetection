seen her in many months.” “Babies come when they come,” my friend answers. “Important families no longer hire her, but poor women still need help.” Midwife Shi has not been able to recapture her reputation after all these years. It seems shameful to me, but I say, “I’m happy your standing continues to grow.” “My mother trained me well,” she responds. “I know what I’m doing. Women trust me. No one is as capable as I am, I can assure you.” “Doctor Wong—” “Has been good to me. If it weren’t for him, I don’t know what my mother and I would have done.” Her jaw tightens under her flawless skin. “My husband is doing well, but if we want to keep improving our lives, all three of us need to work.” She leaves unspoken unlike you. “I now attend to births in all the best families in Wuxi—” “That’s—” I try to interrupt to show my sense of joy for her, but her need to prove something pushes her on. “Since I last saw you,” she talks over me, “I delivered Magistrate Fu’s son. You can’t get much higher than that.” “That’s wonderful! And I’m happy to see you reap the rewards of being a midwife with a good reputation. Grandmother and I are proud of you.” “I’ve received gifts of catties of meat, sacks of rice, and crates of coal.” She takes a breath before continuing. “Furniture! Porcelain vases! Bamboo screens!” Inside, I feel myself retreating. Her enthusiasm seems so mercantile, but then she and her husband have always been working people. The consequences of their labors can be seen in the shop, with its improved merchandise, and in this two-room apartment, where, over the years, I’ve noticed a nice kang purchased and set under the window for Meiling and her husband to sleep on, and a smaller kang in the other room for Midwife Shi. “If I’m lucky,” she comments, “one day a grateful family might honor me with a lavish funeral.” “That is the highest reward anyone can receive,” I have to admit. “Kailoo says that soon we’ll be able to buy our own tea farm, expand the business, and…” She grins. “I’ve been eager to tell you that we’re going to build a single-courtyard house.” “Oh, Meiling, this pleases me greatly!” “None of this would have happened if not for Doctor Wong. A midwife needs male doctors if she’s to fill the rice bowl.” That seems an exaggeration. But maybe it isn’t. I know of only two women doctors—Grandmother and me. Grandmother is limited to caring for the female inhabitants in the Mansion of Golden Light, and Lady Kuo is in charge of employing the physician in the Garden of Fragrant Delights. She likes Doctor Wong, and he uses Meiling. “When I’m mistress of the Yang household,” I say, “you and I will bring many babies into the world.” “I look forward to that.” She reaches for a salted plum. “Have you seen Doctor Wong’s book?” “Hmmm…” This is something I don’t want to talk about.
