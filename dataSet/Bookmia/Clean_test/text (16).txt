I figured it was just a pervert. Or a photographer. The singer dating a Titan. Always good for copy, especially if the Titan is unusual. Roddy doesn’t want to be in the paper, for sure, but he also doesn’t believe that’s what’s happening, so he bought me the shawl. It’s electro-something or other, bunches up on impact, so even though it’s very thin you get plenty of cushioning. Punched across the room, he said, rather than shot. But it’s lovely. God, he hasn’t hurt someone, has he? By mistake?” “Do you know who he thinks might be following you both?” “Someone from his work.” “At the university?” “His research work. He has contracts through them into the private sector.” “You know what he’s working on?” “Something ambient oxygen something perfusion something? I think? He keeps promising to explain it to me, but…we get distracted. It’s all still so new. We talk about music and what we’ll do together. We eat. There’s a bunch of things he’s never tried, food-wise.” “He propose to you?” “Not yet. He was married before. A really long time ago, it’s so weird. My mother was a kid. You know?” “I’m sorry, I don’t.” “No, I guess most people don’t.” She looks away. “Ms. Green, I’m sorry, I have to ask: you’re only seeing Mr. Tebbit, right now? Not anyone else? And he didn’t, uh, displace anyone?” “Yes, and no, he didn’t. Clean catch.” “Okay.” She doesn’t add to that, and nor do I, so we sit together without talking. The sound of the rowdy tables ebbs and flows. Then she looks right at me. “I worked reception in a hospital once. There was a nurse there who was a complete bitch to everyone. Everyone except the critical patients and their families, and the way you knew someone was getting better was she didn’t have time for them any more. The smart ones got that, and when she was rude, they started to cry, because they knew everything was going to be okay. I think you’re the same way, and I think you’ve wasted enough time being kind.” “I don’t know what to say to that.” “You can tell me the truth, Mr. Sounder. He’s dead, isn’t he?” “What makes you think that?” “You do. I saw what you did in the cage. It was hideous. But here you are being nice to me. Am I right?” “Yes.” The affirmation hits her. Her face is so pale anyway that when the blood drains out of it she’s almost translucent. I keep my hands in my lap. I don’t reach out. It’s better that way. She cries silently for a long minute, maybe a lifetime, and then the tears stop. It’s not that there aren’t more, she’s just not sharing them with me. There’s a hollow moment, after you tell someone, when the first grief is exhausted and the long mourning hasn’t begun, when they’re almost not in pain. They can do the needful things, like pass on the bad news, find a babysitter, or talk to a murder
