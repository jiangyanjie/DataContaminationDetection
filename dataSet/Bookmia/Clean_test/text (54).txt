married nor divorced.” “I’m nineteen and not married.” And certainly not getting married anytime soon, after her last conversation with Nathaniel. “Excellent. Room and board includes two home-cooked meals a day. On weekends, you’re on your own. Anyone living here has to be pursuing a career on the stage, whether taking classes, looking for an agent, or auditioning. You already have a job, so that’s covered. The cost is eighteen dollars a week. Let me show you around.” The tour took them to the practice room, where one girl was banging away on a scuffed upright piano while another belted out a song in a strong alto. Down in the basement was the dining room, with a dozen Formica tables crammed into the small space. They took the creaky stairs up to the second floor, where the wallpaper curled away from the ceiling in the corners. The place could do with a serious sprucing-up, but then Marion had grown up in a beautifully appointed house that Mrs. Hornsby had kept in impeccable order. She was quite spoiled in that way, she had to admit. “This is where Bunny sleeps,” said Mrs. Fleming, opening a door.

Moved in with a girl she’d only recently met and barely knew. She was suddenly seized with panic at what she’d put into motion. A completely different life from the one she’d envisioned. Right now, she should be getting ready for a date with Nathaniel, varnishing her nails for when she showed off his sparkling engagement ring, accepting her father’s bear hug when they returned from their date, watching him shake the hand of the man who would become her husband. Instead, she was sitting on a lumpy bed listening to the wail of a police siren on the street below, surrounded by strangers.
