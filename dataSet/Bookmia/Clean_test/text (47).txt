filming. Three steps, kick off the wall, land solid. Go again. Sometimes she does a twist instead, rolling along the chicken wire and coming down like a dancer. I realise I’m in their shot. I’ve always watched them, like birds flying. Now I wonder how many of them scout for Doublewide, how much he sees. How close an eye he’s keeping on me. * * * — Doorman looks me up and down and throws me some revolutionary socialism like it’s a shibboleth. Maybe it is. “What is to be done?” “Well, fuck Bernstein, for a start.” Guy laughs. “I like Bernstein.” “You put a gun to my head, I guess West Side Story’s okay.” His face wrinkles for a second. “Wait—” “I’m screwing with you, man. But I gotta be honest, I don’t really love the vanguard concept all the way to the top.” He stretches out a fist and knocks it against mine. “I hear that.” And he opens the door. * * * — Inside the place is blue with honest-to-god tobacco. There’s a disclaimer about lung cancer and emphysema next to the sign that says they don’t give credit. Technically tobacco is illegal now, in a workplace, but the people here aren’t exactly the type to run to the cops, and the cops aren’t exactly all that interested in busting Lacarte’s for a health violation that’s only gonna buy them ass ache.

The woman who pours it wears an eyepatch, with a scar running down onto her cheek. “I don’t know you,” she says. “I’m Tony.” “Cal.” “You just moved here, Cal?” “I been around awhile. Too lumpen to come for a drink, maybe.” She laughs. “Long live the revolution, then.” I drink for a while. There’s a guy at the end of the bar reading a book. Figure it’s going to be more a political text than pulp. Two tables in deep conversation, not looking for company. I get Tony to bring me some bread. When it comes, it’s Russian black rye, with oil and pickles and a shot. “You looking to meet new people?” “Honestly, I don’t know what I’m looking for. One of the brothers around?” She looks guarded then. “You got a complaint?” “Naw, I don’t want to rile anybody up. Figure it’s polite I talk to one of them. I need something, Tony, and I could not tell you what. But it has to do with this place, maybe, and maybe they can help. If that’s a problem, I’ll just eat my rye and get the hell out.” “You spoke to
