various capacities to see and treat me that way, too. “It’s been hard,” I say with a shrug, when asked how I’m doing, “but I’m hanging in there.” One day, after we run into some friends in the neighborhood, my older child calls me out on my usual choice of words. “How come you always tell people that you’re ‘hanging in there’?” she asks. Well, I think, a bit defensively, because I am. Am I not still doing what needs to be done: getting up every morning and going to work, taking care of my family, saying yes to anything anyone asks me to do? I haven’t dropped a single ball at work. My publishing team has thanked me for my promptness in replying to their emails, for being so great to work with. I am an expert at grieving under capitalism. Watch and learn. All the while, I keep daydreaming about walking into traffic. From the moment the thought pushes its way into my grief-muddled brain, I know that I could never act on it. It’s not that I want to hurt myself—it’s that I cannot seem to work up any remorse when I think about no longer being alive. Nor does the thought frighten me, as it always did before.

What if the pain could just end? As a child, I knew that I was not permitted to indulge in the hyperbolic or sarcastic statements other kids made about wanting to die, because my father would erupt. Toward the end of sixth grade, my teacher had everyone in my class write a fake will; my most charitable reading is that the exercise might have been intended to help us identify the things that were most important to us as we moved from elementary into middle school, symbolically leaving our childhoods behind. Most of my classmates made light of the task—I hereby bequeath my Game Boy to my little brother, because he always steals it anyway—but I remember little of what I wrote in my will, only my father’s fury over the assignment. “You’re twelve years old!” he yelled. He threatened to call my teacher. And then all the fight went out of him, his voice numb as he told me about being twenty-one years old and witnessing the death of his favorite cousin. The two of them had shared an apartment in a Cleveland high-rise, and one night my father came home to find him about to jump from their window. He pleaded with him, tried to stop him, but his cousin leaped before he could reach him. Dad had always blamed himself. It takes me months, after his death, to realize that I am not fine, or hanging in there. I go to see my primary care doctor for a long-overdue physical and break down in the exam room, sobbing
