anything?” She looks away. “Taormina.” “Okay, then, Taormina. What are you doing in my apartment?” “I came to your office. I was leaving, but then you arrived. You weren’t…in great shape.” I do, I think, remember the stairs, the walk from the car. I made it to the first landing and there wasn’t anything left in my legs. Did I throw up? No idea. I sat there and leaned my back against the wall and—yeah. Someone came. “You saw the discharge sheet from St. Helen’s. You called and got Marcus.” “Yes. I hope that was okay.” “Lady, why don’t you just say what you came here to say. We did not get off to the best start and now you’re here in my apartment and I’m all kinds of fucked up. Just…get to it. Please.” “I wanted to make a deal.” “If it’s a plea deal, you’re talking to the wrong guy.” “It’s not a plea deal,” she snaps, but she looks brittle and maybe even scared. “If it’s a sex deal I’m not interested in that either.” “You made that clear, thank you.” “Well, sorry.

It was basically the first thing I saw after I got the lipstick out of my eyes.” “Gee, thanks, Vic.” “I guess you guys are friends or something. I feel kind of stupid for what happened.” “Yeah, you ought to. More than stupid. That was some coercive shit.” “I know.” “You’re fucking lucky Victor didn’t just cancel your subscription.” “She never has before.” That’s a surprise, sort of. Maybe they’ve been escalating. Maybe Victor’s getting a little bit less picky in her old age. I hope not. The club runs on a high wire between vice and horror, and she’s what keeps it up there. If she slips, it’ll get really bad. “How long have you been going?” “A few months. Mac got us in. Business thing.” “What you tried on me…If that’s your jam I’m not teaching you shit.” The brittle look again. “It’s not. Who did this to you?” I tell her the truth. “Stefan.” For a cold minute, I swear, she’s about to ask “Stefan who?” and then she gets it. “You fought Stefan Tonfamecasca?” “No.” “But you said—” “He laughed at me, Ms. Denton. He got right up in my face and he laughed hard enough to cause bruising. That’s the
