“More? Such as what?” “Anything.” “Very well. I had a pet snail when I was seven.” “A snail?” Iris nodded. “His name was Morgie. I kept him in a serving dish with a little tray of water and some rocks and a few wilted flowers. I told him all of my secrets.” “And whatever happened to Morgie?” “He slinked away one day when I was at school. I came home to discover him gone, and he was nowhere to be found. I cried for a fortnight.” “I can imagine that was devastating,” Roman said, at which Iris playfully batted him. “Don’t poke fun at me, Kitt.” “I’m not, Iris.” He effortlessly caught her hand in his, and they both came to a halt in the middle of the street. “Tell me more.” “More?” she breathed, and while her hand felt hot as kindling, she didn’t pull away from him. “If I tell you anything else today, you’ll grow tired of me.” “Impossible,” he whispered. She felt that shyness creeping over her again. What was happening right now, and why did it feel like wings were beating in her stomach? “What’s your middle name?” Roman asked suddenly.

He was looking at her the way he had in Zeb’s office. As if he could see all of her, and Iris swallowed, telling her heart to calm, to slow. “I need to say something to you,” Roman said, tracing her knuckles with his thumb. “You mentioned the other day that you think I’m only here to ‘outshine’ you. But that’s the furthest thing from the truth. I broke my engagement, quit my job, and traveled six hundred kilometers into war-torn land to be with you, Iris.” Iris squirmed. This didn’t feel real. The way he was looking at her, holding her hand. This must be a dream on the verge of dashing. “Kitt, I—” “Please, let me finish.” She nodded, but she inwardly braced herself. “I don’t really care to write about the war,” he said. “Of course, I’ll do it because the Inkridden Tribune is paying me to, but I would much rather that your articles live on the front page. I would much rather read what you write. Even if they aren’t letters to me.” He paused, rolling his lips together as if he was uncertain. “That first day you were gone. My first day as columnist. It was horrible. I realized I
