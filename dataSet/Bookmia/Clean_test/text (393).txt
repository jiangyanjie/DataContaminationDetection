second she had, it felt unutterably right. She told the Janes to burn their uniforms. She wanted them to buy opera coats, and furs, and parasols, and patent-leather boots. She sent one of her men under cover to a department store to buy them a pair of hats. They were shaped like boats and were crammed with white roses. They wore them at the dinner table. “You’re my best girls,” she said, holding them close, feeling teary. “Thanks, Mrs. Bone,” they replied, unmoved. Alice sat between them. They’d edged their chairs aside, making a little room for her. “Thanks,” she said in a whisper. She’d gone pale when Winnie spoke of her own triumphant negotiation with Miss de Vries. “But I took it,” Alice said, voice hoarse. “I took Madam’s money.” The silence was dreadful. Winnie’s expression grew taut. Mrs. King opened her mouth—to protect her sister, to smooth things over. But Jane-two spoke first, eyes solemn. “You did what was necessary for your own preservation,” she said to Alice. “There is honor in that.” Mrs. King touched Winnie’s arm. “Miss de Vries would have reneged on the bargain anyway. She wants to be great. She doesn’t want to be free.” “You don’t know that,” Winnie said. Mrs. King looked grim faced. “I do.” “I’ll pay Madam back,” said Alice, agonized. “I promise.” “Turns out you’ve got some pluck, after all,” said Jane-one to Alice, forking her jelly. “Good for you.” “Pluck?” said Winnie, pulling herself together, pointing to Hephzibah. “Talk about pluck.

At last, Mrs. Bone leaned over. “Well? What’s the matter with you?” “Nothing.” “Don’t ‘nothing’ me.” “Something’s missing,” said Mrs. King. “That’s all.” * * * She had been through every item. They came to her for inspection, one by one, carried or hauled or dragged out from under dustcloths. Painstaking, brutal work. The letter wasn’t there. Had it ever been? she wondered. She pictured Mr. de Vries’s watery gaze. It could have been another trick, a lie, sickbed delirium... She sat on an upturned crate in the yard as the sun went down over the factory, and ran her hands through her hair. A small voice said, “All right?” Alice had been watching her, keeping her distance, as if uncertain about Mrs. King’s mood. Mrs. King roused herself. She stood up. Went to her sister, grasped her by the shoulders. “It’s a funny world, this,” she said. “Don’t let it get to you.” Her sister gave it back at her. “Don’t let it get to you.” * * * Mrs. Bone had given each of them a bedroom, armored, bunkered, almost without light. “Lie low,” she’d said. “Don’t move a muscle. I need three days to shift the best stuff. And a week to get rid of the rest.” They obeyed her. Mrs. Bone knew what she was doing. Mrs. King faced the wall, ancient bedsprings creaking
