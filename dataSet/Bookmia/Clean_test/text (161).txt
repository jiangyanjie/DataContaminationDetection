the other letters had fingerprints,” said Peter. “Maybe he’s getting lazy.” “Do you mind if we wait?” asked Marion. Since it was her week off from Radio City, she didn’t have to worry about the time. “Whatever suits you.” After he left, Marion turned to Peter. “I know he’s a jerk, but maybe you could ease up a bit.” “Ease up? The sheer stupidity of this investigation is maddening.” “But if you push too hard he’ll exclude us entirely. He’s already resentful of all the tips your profile is bringing in.” “Somers seems to have a good head on his shoulders, but this Ogden is a pill. The tips are a gold mine. Why Ogden’s wasting time scouring Westchester is beyond me.” “I couldn’t agree more. But we need him to keep us in the loop with what’s going on with the case, so for now, try not to sock him in the nose.” “Was it that obvious?” Marion couldn’t help but laugh. “Somewhat.” Eventually, Ogden returned, a triumphant smile on his face. “We got him!” he said with a shout from the far side of the room. Everyone stopped what they were doing. “This letter came today. It bears the prints of the Big Apple Bomber.” He seemed to have forgotten that Marion and Peter were even there. “We’re looking for a Vincent Hardenby, of Mount Kisco, New York. He’s a former Met Power worker with a record—used to steal from jobsites, apparently.” As he began shouting orders, the other detectives and policemen rose from their desks, ready for action. Marion and Peter remained where they were. “It’s not him,” said Peter, to no one in particular. “Maybe it is.” Marion wanted it to be. She desperately wanted this to end. For her father’s sake, for the sake of the city. “If I’m right, what do you think the real bomber will do when they announce they’ve made an arrest?” “Set off another bomb, to prove them wrong,” said Marion glumly. “They’re desperate to catch him. Desperation makes people do stupid things. I shouldn’t have brought the letter in.” “You had no choice. We’ll just have to wait until they figure it out themselves.” Peter surveyed the empty room. “Say, I’m starving. Do you want to get something to eat?” Marion had no plans, and the day stretched ahead. Any diversion from the fact that the police were out hunting the wrong guy while the actual bomber continued on his merry way was welcome. “Sure thing.” “There’s not much around here, in terms of restaurants,” said Peter. “It’s all Irish pubs for cops. But I live close by and can make us lunch there, if that’s not too forward.” The Rockettes were regularly sent invitations for private dinners, usually by older men looking for something else on the side, and while some of them accepted—that was how Bunny had met Dale—most of them knew better. Of course, Peter was as far from Dale as could be, and Marion trusted him enough to know this wasn’t a trick or a ruse. She
