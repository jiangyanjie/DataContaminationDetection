and he shook his fists in rage. “It’s the bomber.” Peter looked at Marion, his face white. “He’s back.” CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE We have to get out of here, now!” Peter grabbed Marion and together they ran through the vestibule and parlor, crouching low so as not to be seen through the windows at the front of the house. In the kitchen Marion bumped into a chair, knocking it over. She stopped to right it, but Peter grabbed her hand. “There’s no time.” She followed him out the door and down the back steps. They froze as the sound of coughing echoed in the air. It was a wretched noise, like Martinek’s lungs were straining to expel some kind of poison. That was what he lived with, every day, the chronic pain that had made him turn violent. “He’s on the front porch,” said Marion. A door slammed. He was inside the house. They crept carefully through weeds and up a cracked pathway that ran along the far side of the house, crouching low under Martinek’s bedroom windows. All was silent.

He put it into reverse and backed all the way up the street until he reached the intersection. It was only once they were back on the highway that Marion remembered to breathe. They’d made it, but just barely. * * * They drove straight to police headquarters in downtown Manhattan. Peter parked across the street and the two of them ran inside. At the reception desk on the first floor, Peter explained who they were and that they had something to report about the Big Apple Bomber. “Captain Somers knows us.” “The captain is off today,” said the receptionist. “Is there anyone else I can call?” Just their luck. “Detective Ogden,” said Marion reluctantly. The woman picked up the receiver and dialed an extension. “I see . . . Yes . . . Will do.” She hung up and Marion
