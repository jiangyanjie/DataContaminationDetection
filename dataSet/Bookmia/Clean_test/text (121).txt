and kindly allowing me to ignore the irony. I admit: It was relaxing. After a while, he said, “My friend who had a completely different thing from you used to breathe while I did this, and it helped her a lot.” “I don’t need to breathe, thank you,” I said. “Suit yourself,” Joe said. But then he added, “Deep breaths are super healthy for you, though—even if you’re totally fine. I might take a few myself. Just to improve my already stellar health.” And with that, Joe sucked in a big, loud breath, held it for about three seconds, and then blew it back out. “So refreshing,” he said then. “My grandma does this every day, and she just turned a hundred.” He kept breathing like that, and what can I say? Peer pressure. I joined him. We did about ten rounds, and then, I’m not going to lie: I did feel better. Less dizzy. Less nauseated. Less sweaty. “My friend’s totally different thing used to pass after about twenty minutes,” Joe said then. “I don’t think my thing is going to pass until this party ends,” I said. “Ah,” Joe said. Then, a second later, like he’d had an idea, he said, “Are you okay here on your own for a minute?” “I am now—and will continue to always be—one hundred percent okay,” I insisted, forehead still pressed to the concrete. “Be right back then,” Joe said.

It was brighter than I’d realized. “I guess we do.” It occurred to me then that I might have to start altering some of my opinions about Joe. Next I asked, “And once the coast is clear, are you going to take me out for that dinner you promised?” But Joe just shook his head. “No.” I felt a flash of disappointment. “You’re not?” “Nope,” Joe confirmed then, turning back to the moon. “Because I already ordered us a pizza.” Fifteen WE ATE PIZZA on the roof, cross-legged, watching the city skyline. I don’t know if it was the breeze playing with my hair, or the receding adrenaline from the panic attack, or the layer upon layer of compassion Joe had offered to me, but
