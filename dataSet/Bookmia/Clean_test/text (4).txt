she was named. I kneel next to Meiling and ask White Jade, “Will you let me look?” White Jade shifts her anguished gaze from me to Meiling and then back to me. She bites her upper lip and nods. I carefully pull up White Jade’s gown, revealing her lower leg. Instantly I’m in my mother’s room after she collapsed and I saw her naked limb for the first time. But instead of having red streaks running up the calf, White Jade’s leg is bent at an unnatural angle. “It’s broken,” Meiling says. Indeed, one spot has bulged into the shape of a steep mountain. The bone looks like it could break through the skin at any second. “Poppy,” I call, knowing she must be nearby. She steps into view. “Go get Grandmother. Hurry!” “And my mother as well,” Meiling adds. “Bring them both.” White Jade whimpers. “It hurts…” I sit back on my haunches, trying to figure out what to do. “Maybe we should try to pull it straight,” I say to Meiling. “I once saw a bonesetter do just that,” she agrees. Hearing this, White Jade whimpers again. “I’m scared that if we don’t do something, the bone will tear through the skin.” My mind goes again to my mother, and I add, “If that happens, infection will come. But if we pull the bone—” “You will do no such thing!” Grandmother’s voice comes out as sharp as cut glass. “You two girls step away right now!” Meiling and I scramble to our feet and back away. Midwife Shi kneels next to the concubine, but Grandmother keeps her distance. “This is not the type of affliction physicians like your grandfather and I treat.” “I know,” I say. “We just—” “I don’t want to hear a single excuse. I’ve sent Inky to find a bonesetter. Now all we can do is wait.” With that, Grandmother turns away—disappointed or angry with me, maybe both. When the bonesetter arrives, Midwife Shi scoots behind White Jade, wraps her arms around the concubine, and clutches her opposite wrists with each hand drawn across her chest. The bonesetter cups White Jade’s calf with one hand and, without telling her what he’s going to do, quickly pulls her ankle with his other hand. White Jade screams, but the bone is once again—to my eyes at least—in place. I exchange glances with Meiling. He’s done exactly what we’d planned to do. As he wraps the concubine’s leg in a support made of cloth and bamboo, Grandmother steps forward. “Servants will carry you to your quarters,” she tells White Jade. “As soon as you’re settled, I will come with a tea to help ease your pain.” Sweat glistens on White Jade’s forehead. She reaches her hand out to Grandmother, who doesn’t take it. “What will this mean for me?” she asks. In these words, her deepest fear is revealed: about her future ability to entrance Grandfather with her beautiful lily-foot walk. “I cannot say,” Grandmother answers. * * * A few hours later, Lady Huang goes into labor.
