He put together a map that gave each worker a territory as well as a system for appointments that saved time and money while increasing efficiency. Before he knew it, he was the boss of his team, then the boss of the whole repair division, and, eventually, vice president in charge of hiring, evaluating, and paying thousands of Met Power employees. This last promotion had come five years ago, with Simon Brooks heralded as a shining example of American ingenuity and grit. The three “Employee of the Year” awards on the bookshelf behind him—in addition to the one in his home study—were a testament to his standing in the company. He threw himself into his work and enjoyed it immensely. “What’s going on, then?” asked Simon. He opened the file Judy had given him and smoothed it flat on his desk. “I have something I wanted to tell you,” she said. His eyes went to her left hand. “Is Nathaniel back already?” She covered her bare finger with the other hand, annoyed that was the only thing that ever came to his mind these days. She disliked being treated like chattel. No doubt Simon intended on giving away a few goats for her dowry as well. “No. It’s not that. You see, yesterday I went to Radio City—” “Simon! We have bad news.” She turned. Two men had charged into the office, concerned looks on their faces. Judy slipped in after them and closed the door behind her. “What is it?” asked Simon.

She’d been introduced to him at last year’s Christmas party, probably. “There’s been another bombing,” said the other man. “That makes four just this year.” “Where?” Simon rubbed his face. “The New York Public Library. In a phone booth.” “Anyone hurt?” “Not this time. Luckily.” Her father rose from his chair. “We have to see the chairman. Girls, I’ll be back. Don’t go anywhere.” The men were gone as fast as they’d come in. “How many does this make?” asked Marion. “Thirty-one,” answered Judy. Both sisters knew the story well. For the past sixteen years, starting in 1940, someone had been planting pipe bombs around New York City, in subway stations, department stores, theaters, even Grand Central Terminal. The newspapers called the culprit the Big Apple Bomber, and so far, a dozen people had been injured, some seriously. The very first bomb was planted in a toolbox at a Met Power compound on Sixty-Fourth Street, with a note reading Met Power crooks—this is for you. That one hadn’t gone off. But since then, the bomber had expanded his reach and his skill, setting off explosions in well-populated places like the Port Authority and Penn Station, sometimes repeating the same target years later. And now he’d hit the library. Even worse, the madman’s pace was picking up. After the very first bomb and note, the Big Apple Bomber had struck Met Power twice more, leaving
