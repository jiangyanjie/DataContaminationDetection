Which is odd when I think about it now; I knew to keep family matters private from outsiders but never considered the secrets we were possibly keeping from one another. “It’s not something to spread around, okay?” Mum quickly added. “Family business.” Could I finally move out? My refusal to leave hung on the fact that Dad needed someone more constant than Dawoud’s visits, but Mum will be here. I’d have to return when she eventually left again, but while I have the chance … Maybe I could get out more. Meet people. Meet someone. Finally have an answer to Mum’s perpetual question. What could it hurt to go on a date, knowing I wouldn’t have to rush back home after? To invite a man into my house, introduce him to my friends and be introduced to his. What could it hurt to maybe even fall in love?

This is your job!” “Okay,” Claire says, finally getting up from her seat. “Katherine, why don’t you leave Maddie to sort out your diary—I’m sure it won’t take her very long.” She speaks as if reasoning with a toddler and ushers Katherine back into her office. “Whilst she’s doing that, I’ll make you a cup of tea, how’s that sound?” “Yes, thank you, Claire,” Katherine says between labored breaths. “That’s very kind.” I turn back to my computer, feeling everyone’s eyes still stuck to me. I don’t cry until enough time has passed for me to inconspicuously use the bathroom. There I ruminate on whether Katherine has a favorite cubicle to
