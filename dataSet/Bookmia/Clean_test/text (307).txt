They’re both so sure of how they feel about things.” He pulls another curl straight, and the gentle tug sends a current down my center. “Well, we should get to know you,” he says. “I wouldn’t know where to start.” “Something small,” he says. “Like what?” He smiles unevenly. “Like why do you love cozy mysteries?” I shrug. “I don’t know.
