included. “Banoffee pie ice-cream sundae,” he announces. “You’ve got caramelized bananas, crumbled cookies and shortbread, salted caramel sauce, and the ever humble vanilla ice cream.” I smile at his enthusiasm. “You know, Ben, as the night proceeds, the less I believe you’re really single.” I take the sundae he offers me. “Somewhere upstairs, behind one of your many doors, is a thriving harem.” “You couldn’t be further from the truth,” he says. “Can you imagine me having to make this dinner five or six more times?” This time when he sits at the table, he pulls out the chair next to him. When I’m seated, he uses his leg to drag the chair closer to him, but I stick my spoon in my sundae. I think of Cam’s friend being ghosted by the man who brought her flowers and then shortly after had his hand in someone else’s hair. I have to ask. “Are you single, Ben?” He doesn’t waver. “I am. Are you?” “Of course I am. I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t.” Ben tilts his head. “You have this real innocent thing about you.” I don’t know whether that’s a good thing or not; I don’t know whether I want him to think I am or not. So I sit and eat my ice cream. “I think the opposite of you,” I finally admit. “Not that you’re not-innocent, but rather … experienced.” I twirl a finger around the kitchen. “You’ve done this before. It’s been such a smooth night, there’s no doubt you’ve done this before.” “I don’t deny it,” he says. I have to wait for him to swallow his ice cream before he continues. “Last year, I came out of a four-year relationship.” Four years? “What happened? If you don’t mind me asking.” “We grew apart,” he says. “It took me a while to accept that, sometimes, nothing is wrong.” He looks calm as he says it, maybe a little sad even. “Growing up and apart—it can happen.” “Growing up” catches me off guard because he’s thirty-four. He’s already grown up, but then I realize how naive that sounds. I don’t think you turn thirty and become immune to mistake-making or lesson-learning. You grow wiser (supposedly) but never omniscient. There’s always something you need to be taught, and so you keep learning and you keep growing up—until you’re dead. But I don’t know that feeling and I’m having difficulty imagining it. Ben has experienced real love, having a partner, another half. He’s grown older with someone, experienced life with them, years, milestones, celebrations as well as lamentations. It’s a mature response to the end of all of that, to the end of four years with someone you no longer see. “Do you date much, Maddie?” I don’t want to tell him my last date was eight years ago at Nando’s and that my ex had brought his friends along so we could all share the platter. But his response was so honest I can’t find it in me to lie. “No, not much at all,” I admit.
