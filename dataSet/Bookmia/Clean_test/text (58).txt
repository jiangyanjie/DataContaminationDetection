he replied with characteristic solipsism that if I had to ask, I would never understand the answer. “Come down to the tavern,” he said after dark had fallen. “No, thank you,” I said, glancing up from the dryadology journal I was jotting notes from—I was working on the bibliography for my encyclopaedia. “I’d like an early night.” “You don’t have to stay long. You’d rather sit here with your nose in a book?” “Vastly,” I said, and he shook his head at me, not in disgust but utter bemusement. “Very well, you strange creature,” he said, and to my astonishment he took off his cloak and settled himself in the other chair. “You don’t have to stay. I’m perfectly content by myself.” “Yes, I’ve noticed.” I shrugged. I didn’t mind him staying; I am in fact used to having him around, not only here but at Cambridge, where he is always poking his nose into my office.

You are so contrary that I would not be surprised by both concurrently. Perhaps you could set my nerves at ease.” “I am only wondering what in God’s name you are doing,” I said, taking refuge in the familiar banter. “What does it look like? You and your hairy accomplice ravaged my cloak.” He added a few more stitches and ran his hands over the fabric, folding it this way and that—I could not make out precisely what he was doing. “There.” He tried the cloak on, nodded. If anything, it looked even more magnificent than before, with an elegant billow in the hem, as if the weaver had cut the pattern from his shadow. He saw the expression on my face and raised his eyebrows. “I can do yours if you like.” He grimaced slightly. “And that—that dress.” I looked down at my woollen shift. “There’s nothing wrong with my clothing.” “It doesn’t fit you.” “Of course it does.” He lifted his eyes to the ceiling and muttered something that I couldn’t hear, apart from the distinct words paper bag.
