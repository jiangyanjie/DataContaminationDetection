into Mattingly,” Mom says. “You’re clearly very intelligent.” “He is,” I say, right as he says, “I was a student athlete.” “Well, to get into medical school, anyway,” Dad says. I full-body wince, but Wyn squeezes my knee reassuringly. “I’m actually not a med student,” he says. “He’s in law school, Phil,” Mom says, irritable. “That’s Sabrina and Parth,” I say. “Wyn works at the bookstore and does furniture repair.” You know, I think, the one I’m engaged to. But I think it with a smile that hopefully says, No big deal that you don’t remember the slightest thing about the love of my life. “Oh.” Mom tries to smile pleasantly. She and my dad exchange the briefest of looks, allies for a second. “Have you thought about the wedding at all?” Eloise asks. “Oh, I’m sure it’s way too early for that,” Mom says. “Harriet’s still got a couple of years of medical school. And then she’ll have to do a long residency.” Anxiety gurgles through my gut. “We’re figuring it out.” Under the table, Wyn’s hand finds mine, and he laces our fingers together. He drags the pad of his thumb over the callus where I burnt my index finger with Sabrina and Cleo on our first trip to the cottage. I got you. “We’re not in a rush,” Wyn says. “I don’t want to do anything that gets in the way of Harriet’s career.” It’s the perfect answer for my parents. My chest relaxes at my mom’s pleased smile. Eloise downs her glass of wine and sets her napkin on the table. “I should get going,” she says. “I’ve got work early in the morning.” “Who gets their makeup done early in the morning?” Mom asks, like it’s an entirely innocent question and not a thinly veiled expression of two decades’ worth of disappointment. “Brides.” Eloise pulls her denim jacket off the back of her chair. “Like Harriet.” Mom starts to stand. “At least let me put some leftovers together for you.” Eloise holds her off, insists she’s too busy the next couple of days and won’t get around to eating them, and Mom sags a little but relents. After quick waves and nice to meet yous, Eloise sees herself out. “More wine?” Mom says. We have another glass, sitting around the cleared table. Some of the awkwardness and tension fades as we sip, largely because Wyn brings up the research position I’ve scored for the summer, how proud he is of me. “You know,” Dad says, “we never had to worry about Harriet. Never even had a rebellious phase.” “Never got a detention,” Mom says, “had perfect grades, got plenty of scholarships. No matter how stressful anything else was, we always knew Harriet was fine.” Wyn gives me a look I can’t read, a tenderness around his mouth but concern in his brow. He’s good at getting them talking about themselves too: Mom talks about her receptionist job at the dentist’s office—“Of course it’s not brain surgery,” she says brightly, “but it’s fast-paced work, and it keeps me
