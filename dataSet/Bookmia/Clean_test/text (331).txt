voice brought her back into the moment. He was standing beside her, intently watching her face. “Kitt.” She reached for his hand as the floor began to shake beneath her. She wondered if it was the aftershocks of a distant bomb, but the rumbling only intensified, as if something was drawing closer. There was a loud pop, and Iris instantly cowered, teeth clenched. Roman pulled her back up, holding her against his chest. His voice was warm in her hair as he whispered, “It’s just a lorry. It’s just backfire. We’re safe here. You’re safe with me.” She closed her eyes, but she listened to the beat of his heart and the sounds encircling them. He was right; the rumbling she felt was from a lorry driving by the house. The icy sweat still prickled on her palms and at the nape of her neck, but she was able to steady herself in his arms. Multiple lorries must be driving by. Because the siren continued to wail, and the ground continued to shake. She opened her eyes, feeling the sudden urge to look at him. “Kitt, you don’t think…?” Roman only gazed down at her, but there was a haunted gleam in his eyes. You don’t think this is Dacre’s soldiers? You don’t think that this is the end, do you? He didn’t know, she realized as he caressed her face. He touched her the same way he always had, as if he wanted to savor it. As if it could be the last time. The front door blew open with a bang. Iris startled again, but Roman kept his arms around her. Someone was in the house, striding down the corridor with a heavy tread. And then came a voice, unfamiliar yet piercing. “Marisol!” A woman appeared in the kitchen. A tall soldier, dressed in an olive-green blood-splattered uniform. A rifle was strapped to her back, grenades to her belt. A golden star was pinned above her heart, revealing her status as a captain. Her blond hair was cut short, but a few tendrils shone in the light beneath her helmet. Her face was gaunt as if she hadn’t eaten properly over the past few months, but her brown eyes were keen, cutting across the kitchen to where Iris and Roman stood, embracing. At once, Iris knew her. She had been kneeling in this woman’s garden, preparing it for her return. “Keegan?” “Yes. Where’s my wife?” Keegan demanded. She hardly gave Iris the chance to respond before she turned on her heel, disappearing down the hallway. “Mari? Marisol!” Iris slipped from Roman’s arms, hurrying after her. “She’s not here.” Keegan pivoted in the foyer. “Where is she?” “At the infirmary. What’s happening? Do we need to evacuate?” “Yes.” Keegan’s gaze flickered beyond her, to where Roman had limped into the hallway, following them. “One of you needs to get the dash-packs ready. The other, come with me.” She stepped back into the brightness of the front yard, and Iris turned to Roman. “Marisol has the dash-packs in the pantry,” she explained.
