he says with a sly smile when Zach Brayer, the series creator, asks him to settle a debate once and for all: Alice or Sofia. “But for some reason, Zach wasn’t too keen on it.” Toward the end of the show, when it’s time for audience questions, someone asks about rumors of a reboot or spin-off swirling around the internet. I’ve seen the rumors, too—they all seem to stem from the fact that Zach said last month that he’d love to write something else set in the Nocturnals universe, maybe even with some of the same characters. “A reboot? I don’t think so,” Ethan says with a laugh. “No offense, but it would feel a little like going backward. I think I’m just at a different stage of my career right now.” A wave of gossipy murmurs moves through the audience. “So he’s just determined to be the worst, huh,” Noemie mutters. “I mean—” Ethan says, fumbling, clearly seeing the fans are souring on him, but Hallie’s already talking over him. “For those of us who aren’t above the show that jump-started all of our careers, I would love to do a reboot.

I have to fight the urge to grab it myself and tug him closer, because suddenly that’s all I want to do. “You were amazing,” I say instead. “Thank you. Uh.” He glances backward, rakes a hand through his hair. “Do you want to come in? It’s not much, but . . .” “Right, sure. Of course.” This awkwardness between us is new. He opens the door wider, revealing a vanity and costume rack, a half dozen flower arrangements crowding a tiny desk. The room is so small, I wonder if he can hear the racing of my pulse. This is Finn, I remind myself. The man who has never given me a reason to feel anything but confident. I can do this. He leans back against
