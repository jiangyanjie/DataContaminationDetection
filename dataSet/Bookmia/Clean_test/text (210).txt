Hap snapped. “S-stop talking. No one say a w-w-word. I’ll find a way out of h-here. Victor, can you hear me? Victor.” But Vic couldn’t answer. He stared up at the sky as the house loomed before them. The last thing he saw before they were swallowed by the house was a blackbird circling overhead, singing its winter song. “Sorry about this!” the Coachman cried. “It might sting a little! Just need to make you a bit more compliant. It’ll be over before you know it.” “Oh no,” Nurse Ratched said as an electric snarl filled the air. The wire mesh around them crackled to life, and electricity coursed through them, causing them all to shake and seize. And then all Vic knew was darkness. Dad smiled. “My wonderful boy. My weary traveler.” Vic reached for him. But Dad was gone. His vision blurred. He blinked again and again. “Finally,” Nurse Ratched said. “I was almost worried. Victor, are you all right?” Vic turned his head. He lay on his back in a cage. The bars were black and thick. He sat up, groaning as he did so. His body felt stiff, his muscles aching. He stretched his arms over his head, popping his back. His helmet sat at an odd angle. He righted it, adjusting the strap under his chin. “Ah!” a cheerful voice said. “Good! You’re awake. I was worried for a moment. I thought I’d used too much juice.” Vic looked out between the bars of the cage, the floor humming quietly underneath him. In front of the cage—and well out of arm’s reach—sat the Coachman in a high-backed chair, Vic’s pack in his lap. The cages themselves were in a row, Hap to Vic’s left, Nurse Ratched and Rambo in their own cages to Vic’s right. When Hap saw Vic rising to his feet, he stopped pacing. “Are you all r-rright?” Vic winced, rubbing the back of his neck. “I think so.” “I’ll k-kill you,” Hap snarled at the Coachman. “The m-moment I g-get out of here, I am g-going to tear you apart.” “Ooh,” the Coachman said. “I believe that. Yes, good. Use it. Harness that anger. Be as fearsome as you like!” He laughed as he clapped. “It’ll only make things that much more interesting for my paying customers.” “What do you want?” Rambo moaned. “Are you going to eat us?” “Of course not,” the Coachman said. “What a terrible thought. I would never do such a thing, my little friend. You are a vacuum. You are very important to me.” “I am?” Rambo asked. “Why?” The Coachman waved his hand around the room. What filled the space around them wasn’t unlike what Dad had gathered in the ground house, though on a much larger scale. It was a strange assortment, bits and bobs of humanity under a vaulted ceiling with exposed beams. The shelves on the walls were lined with all manner of things: darkened computer screens, small televisions, spoons and forks, lamps with gaudy glass shades, stuffed toys (bears and horses with horns on
