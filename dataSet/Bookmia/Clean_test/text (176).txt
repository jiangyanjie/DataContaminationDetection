felt as responsible for them as they were for me. But had I been wrong to feel that way? They certainly never saw their burdens as mine to share, instead choosing to shield me from them for as long as they could. They were my parents: they looked after me, not the other way around. * * * The lack of air-conditioning in my childhood home was bearable because we could open our windows at night—except during wildfire season, when we might occasionally suffer and sweat in the hot, tightly sealed rooms of our house. The fires rarely threatened more densely populated areas, and I never worried about them reaching our house. From time to time, we would hear that a friend who lived much farther out from town had to evacuate, but I didn’t know anyone who had lost their home to fire. I can remember only a few late summer or early fall days when smoky air settled in the hills and hollows around us, making it impossible to go outside and play. The land, the climate, and the housing patterns have all changed in the years since I left home. Four months after my mother died, a fire started fifteen minutes from her neighborhood. High winds carried the sparks far afield, allowing the blaze to grow and fan out for miles. Unlike the wildfires I remember from childhood, this one roared parallel to some of the busiest roads in the area, ravaging parkland, businesses, and thousands of homes. I was shocked to see news of the runaway destruction, although California wildfires had been in the news for weeks, and I’d heard about the terrible air quality in the Bay Area, Seattle, Portland, Vancouver. My home region lacks a major urban center and rarely draws outside media attention. But the damage was too vast to be ignored, and terrifying headlines and images from my parents’ tiny town of a few thousand residents soon filled my social media feeds. I checked on friends and acquaintances and tried to call my aunt, who had inherited my parents’ house after my mother died. When I didn’t get an answer, I texted Paula, who confirmed that she, her husband, and my aunt were safe—and so was Buster. They were all hunkered down at Paula’s, in sight of the flames but hoping they wouldn’t need to evacuate. They couldn’t say whether my parents’ home had survived. Dan and I scoured the internet for local news reports, searching for the name of my parents’ park and other nearby landmarks. We watched shaky video footage shot by local residents; paused and zoomed in on aerial video shared by local news outlets, trying to identify my parents’ neighborhood. When I stumbled over an article about entire groves of ponderosa pines lost to wildfire, I felt another kind of grief. What if the cemetery had been leveled, too? I pictured the peaceful graveyard, with its hundred-year-old oaks and pines, bare and smoking; my parents’ gravestones scorched and illegible. I thought again of their house, their windows facing the mountains,
