assured him our son would become master of the Garden of Fragrant Delights. Now Manzi never will.” She begins to weep as only a mother who has lost a son can. I know I should comfort her, but I am too distracted by what she has said. Her words have turned a key in my mind and opened a door. Manzi never looked like Master Yang. If my unborn son died, Manzi would have eventually become the new master, according power to Manzi and his natal family. Spinster Aunt had something to tell me after Manzi’s birth but her death came before she could tell me… It has taken me many years to stitch these pieces together. Now I realize Manzi’s father could be only one person. And that person schemed and plotted from the day his son was born, which also means… Spinster Aunt’s death was not an accident. The Washing Away of Wrongs After the heavenly flowers disease disappears completely from the Garden of Fragrant Delights, the last survivors return to their families or, in the case of concubines and servants, to their masters, and I’m free to go back to my rooms. I’m determined to visit Meiling, since the suspicions that arose from Miss Chen’s utterance directly concern my friend and the herbs that were meant for me, but I need to get settled with my family before I do anything else. I also have much that I’m eager to discuss with my husband, but my first night home he doesn’t come to my bedchamber. A disappointment. I fall asleep feeling exhausted and dispirited. The next morning, when Poppy pours my tea, she brings the gossip that Master Yang is going to remove Miss Chen and her sole surviving child, Fifth Daughter, from the Garden of Fragrant Delights. I dress and then rush to find my husband. He’s in his library. “Is it true your father is casting off his concubine and her daughter?” I ask. Perhaps this is not the correct approach as Maoren and I have not been alone together since I left for Beijing seven months ago. So much has happened, including the birth of our son, but I haven’t given my husband a chance to express his joy or thank me for doing what I could during the smallpox outbreak. “Since when have the hens begun to crow?” he asks, squinting his disapproval. I take a breath and remind myself that I’m a wife before anything else. “I’m sorry,” I say, bowing my head. “I spoke sharply.” Maoren stands up and walks toward me. He reaches out and brushes a loose strand of hair from my cheek. “You look tired.” “I’m tired to my marrow.” I raise my eyes to meet his. “Maoren, why is your father expelling Miss Chen?” “She is no longer a beauty,” he states. It’s true, but I can’t let this go. “Don’t let your father turn her out. She helped me during the sickness. She was courageous when—” “The concubine has already been dismissed,” he says, swiveling away from me.
