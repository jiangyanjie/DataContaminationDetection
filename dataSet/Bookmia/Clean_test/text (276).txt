frantically as she practically jumps up and down in relief. “Hello? We need help! We’re at Camp Mirror Lake. Please!” She pauses and her brows push together. “What? Hello? No. Mirror Lake. The camp! Please!” She holds the phone away from her face, and tears fill her eyes. “The call dropped.” “Do you think they heard anything you said?” Kyle asks. “Will they send somebody?” “I—I don’t know,” Bezi says. Kyle slumps onto the recliner with his head in his hands. “This cannot be happening.” Javier moves toward the door, slipping on his coat. “I’m going to the office to call an ambulance from the landline.” Kyle looks up. “Whoever did that to her is still out there, and you’re just gonna go for a fuckin’ stroll?” “What else are we supposed to do?” Javier asks angrily. “Just let her die?” Kyle shakes his head. “No. But—” “But nothing,” Javier says. “I’d go look for Bezi’s keys, but I feel like I’d be wasting time. I’m going to the office. You all keep looking. I’ll be right back.” For the first time in the last few days, it seems like he’s genuinely concerned about somebody other than himself. “I’ll go with you,” Bezi says. I start to protest, but Javier beats me to it. “Nah,” he says. “I’ll be okay. Stay with her.” He moves to the front window and peers out into the dark. “I’ll take a flashlight. Once I’m inside with the door locked, I’ll flash the light on and off three times; that way you know I’m safe.

Kyle gets up and opens the door for him, and Javier bolts down the steps, disappearing into the dark. Kyle slams the door shut, locking it, and I crane my neck at the window to try and track Javier. I see the reflective yellow stripe on the back of his coat as he books it to the front office. A few moments later, three flashes come from the window and I exhale a sigh of relief. “He’s in,” I say. “He’s safe.” Tasha stirs, and I rush to her side as Bezi takes hold of her hand. Tasha groans, and her hands open and close into fists. “I know it hurts,” Bezi says. “Try not to move too much.” I grab a stack of hand towels from the kitchen and bring them back to the couch. I gently lift the blanket covering Tasha’s belly. A terrible sinking feeling settles over me as I get a good look at the wound. I make my face a mask, but inside I want to scream. I press the towels against the wound, and Tasha groans. Tasha is dying. If we don’t get her some help soon, she is not going to make it. “Por—Porter and Paige,” Tasha whispers through her
