him lead her silently to the door. When she looked back, day had fully broken in the window behind Bastian, casting his features in shadow, limning their edges gold. It illuminated him like rays around a sun, like a halo. CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT Sometimes, you can see love coming. And when it takes a different path, you should be thankful. —Fragment from the work of Marya Addou, Malfouran poet The walk back to their apartments was silent. Gabe stayed behind her, a one-eyed shadow dogging her steps and making sure she went where she was supposed to. She no longer wore chains, but it was the first time Lore had truly felt like a prisoner in the Citadel. Their room was locked. Lore had the key half fitted in the door before Gabe stepped up beside her. “It won’t work.” His voice was low. “Anton had the lock changed.” She looked at him and said nothing. There was nothing to say. Gabe swallowed. He unlocked the door with a key he produced from his pocket, then stepped aside to let her in first. The apartments felt strange now—foreign and ill fitting, where before they’d been as close to comfortable as she could find here. Especially knowing Anton had changed the lock sometime after she left last night. Myriad hells, he’d probably had someone waiting in the halls, watching for her to leave so they could immediately set to work. Because Gabe told him. Gabe told him everything. Her wrists felt raw. The iron had made them itch.

You heard everything I just did, you know that Anton is working against August!” “But you didn’t.” Her fingers went back to her wrist again, itching, itching. “You had no idea what Anton was involved in, and it’s pure stupid luck you didn’t get all three of us murdered!” “It was either that or watch you go to a far more likely murder in the damn catacombs!” Gabe ran his hands over his close-shorn hair, turned away. “I wanted him to stop you from going down there at all. Both of you. That seemed like a much more pressing matter than playing politics—” “It’s more than playing politics! If we’d been right, if Anton and August were still on the same side, Bastian might’ve—”
