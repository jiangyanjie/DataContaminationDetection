“Thank you. For all of this,” he says, reaching to give my arm a haphazard pat, not quite making it. “I mean it. I’d probably be a husk of a human being by now if it weren’t for you.” The way he says it makes me wonder whether anyone else has taken care of him like this before. Whether he’s let them. “Of course,” I say, my throat suddenly dry. His head lolls to one side of the pillow, and it’s clear those meds are stronger than either of us thought. “Chandler, Chandler, Chandler. I must be hell to work with. I can hardly believe you’re putting up with me.” “It’s the paycheck, mostly.” His eyes open wider and he looks at me hard, the weight of his gaze pinning me in place. “I reeeeeally shouldn’t tell you this, but . . . I know someone who has a crush on you.” He says this in a singsong, like we’re at fourth grade recess and he’s relaying a message from a friend. “Ha, ha,” I say. “Well, we don’t have many mutual friends, so—” “It’s me,” he clarifies, holding up his thumb and forefinger. “Just an itty bitty crush when we first met.” “I did, too. That’s kind of why I went back to your hotel room.” His grin deepens, and he wags that finger back and forth. “After that,” he says. “Not just that first time.

Even with his eyes beginning to droop, he’s still stunning. “But—but you can’t,” I say, as though simply denying it will make it untrue. You can’t and we’ll rewind to thirty seconds ago, back when our relationship still made sense. Because that wasn’t how this was supposed to work. It takes every ounce of strength in me to scoot to the edge of the bed, so violently that I nearly fall off. It’s not real. It’s purely chemical, his brain convincing him that he feels something for the person he’s sleeping with. There should have been a warning on those meds: do not mix with oxytocin. Despite the fact that we’ve seen each other naked a handful of times now, his words linger, wrapping around my heart and setting down roots there, where they could grow into something even more invasive. There’s a terrifying sweetness to them, an innocence that isn’t always there when our hotel room doors are locked. Maybe also right now, too. “Can’t, schmant.” He seems to get another burst of energy, sitting up in bed. “You’re just . . . so smart. So nice. And you wear socks when you
