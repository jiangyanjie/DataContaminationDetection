has only a few lines; we see him in the library, because what surer way to establish that he’s a nerd, falling asleep in the middle of a book. When he wakes up after the library’s closed, he’s hit with a sudden chill. A sense of unease. Nothing around him appears to be wrong, though . . . until he heads out into the night and the audience sees paw prints tracking him down the library’s dusty hallway. Roll credits. The Finn on my phone seems to be going out of his way to be professional. Which, in theory, I shouldn’t mind—it’s just so clearly a concerted effort. I decided last night, in the middle of not being able to sleep because of airplane anxiety and not being able to sleep because of new-job anxiety, that this trip doesn’t need to be uncomfortable. This is a rare, frankly incredible opportunity I’ve been given. And I’m going to do everything I can to enjoy it in all the ways I couldn’t with Maddy’s book. That mood lasts about until I check into my hotel and open the door to my room. It’s not that I was expecting lush digs or anything, but there’s barely any space to walk around the bed, there’s no shower curtain in the bathroom, and the room’s single electrical outlet is, inexplicably, located inside the closet. Stay positive, I urge myself, unplugging a lamp so I can charge my phone. I’ll be here only a couple nights, so I unpack my carry-on but leave my larger suitcase untouched. Then I put on a vintage Harley Quinn T-shirt I found in a thrift shop years ago and have only ever worn to sleep in because it’s a little big, but today it seems perfect. I tuck it into high-waisted jeans and add a cotton blazer, which I swap for an oversize flannel, which I swap for the blazer again before lying down on the bed and forcing myself to breathe. At these cons, I’m meant to essentially become Finn’s shadow, tailing him from panel to signing and back again. Watching how he interacts with fans. Getting to know him—not just his personality, but his voice, his mannerisms and quirks and favorite turns of phrase, all of which will help me embody him when I start writing. He had a fan meet and greet earlier today, so I won’t see him until his panel this afternoon. In theory, today is supposed to be low stress. While I have a few pages full of research and links I compiled over the week, I’m not starting an outline of the book until we get a chance to discuss what he has in mind. Some of my authors have had clear ideas of format and narrative structure, or they’ll have already worked with an editor on an outline, which Finn has not. This book is important to him, he assured me. I have to believe he’ll have some sense of direction. Even though I have enough per diem for an Uber and I’ve been
