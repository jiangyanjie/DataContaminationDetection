protest, he herds me into the largest bedroom, like he’s a cattle dog and I’m a particularly difficult sheep. The second the door snicks shut, I whirl on him, prepared to attack, only to be hit with the full force of his closeness, the strange intensity of being behind a closed door together. I can feel my heart beating in the back of my throat. We’re close enough that I can see his pupils dilating. His body has decided I’m a threat he needs to analyze as quickly as possible. The feeling is mutual. It was easy to be angry when we were downstairs, surrounded by our friends. Now I feel like I’m standing naked on a spotlighted platform for his inspection. He finds his voice first, a low rasp. “I know this isn’t ideal.” The ludicrousness of the statement jump-starts my brain. “Yes, Wyn. Spending a week locked in a bedroom with my ex-boyfriend is not ideal.” “Ex-fiancé,” he says. I stare at him. He looks away, scratching his forehead. “I’m sorry,” he says. “I didn’t know what to do.” His eyes come back to mine, too soft now, too familiar. “She called me with a speech. About how this was the end of an era. About how she’d never asked me for anything and she never would again. I tried calling you. It only rang once, but I left a voicemail.” There was a very good reason I hadn’t gotten the message. “I blocked your number,” I say.

I needed to take the possibility away, to free myself from waiting for it. His eyes go stormy. His lips part. He looks toward the balcony, grooves rising between his eyebrows. He just has one of those vaguely tortured faces, I remind myself. He can’t help it, and he certainly doesn’t need my comfort. He’s the one who derailed our life together in a four-minute phone call. His jaw muscles leap as his pale-fog eyes retrain on me. “What should I have done, Harriet?” Found an excuse. Simply told her no. Not have broken my heart like it was a last-minute dinner plan. Not have made me love you in the first place. I shake my head. He steps closer until he’s a question mark, hanging over me. “I’m really asking.” On a sigh, I drop my eyes and massage my temples. “I don’t know. But now there’s nothing we can do. You can’t break up at a wedding. Especially when the guest list is four people.” “Maybe we give them tonight,” he says. “Celebrate everything, tell them tomorrow.” I look up at the ceiling, buying some time. Maybe in the next four seconds the world will end, and I’ll be spared making this decision. “Harriet,” he presses. “Fine,” I bite out. “I’m sure we can stomach each other for one more night.” His gaze narrows, limiting the intake
