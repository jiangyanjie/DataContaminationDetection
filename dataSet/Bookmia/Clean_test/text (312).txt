and I’d never forgive myself for jeopardizing a job like that. We’ll go our separate ways when the book is done, anyway. No attachments. No feelings. “Could you make it out to Noemie? That’s N-o-e—” “Nome?” The sound that comes out of my mouth can only be compared to a pterodactyl screech. I leap out of my chair, its legs squealing against the linoleum floor. There she is, the last person in the signing line, grinning back at me. “You made it!” I nearly knock over a stack of Finnegan Walsh headshots in my attempt to hug her. No shock, she looks extremely put together even after a six-hour flight, dark hair in a low ponytail and not a single crease in her linen pants. “Thank you, thank you, thank you. I love you.” When I release her, she’s gazing at Finn with what might as well be heart-eyes. “This is the famous Noemie,” Finn says, and my cousin looks like she might faint. “You told him about me?” she stage-whispers. “Only the embarrassing things.” And I mentioned she was flying in, of course, white-lying that she had some spontaneous time off and wanted some sun. Finn extends a hand. “Pleasure to meet you.

I’ve always felt that Hollywood never properly recognized you. You should have been getting better roles. More challenging, more interesting roles.” Finn throws a pointed look my way. “It’s so nice to finally be around someone who appreciates my talent.” It’s a testament to said talent that he’s able to say this with a straight face. “Oh please,” I say with a roll of my eyes, waving an arm around the room. “What do you think all of this is?” Finn bites back a grin before he returns his attention to my slowly melting cousin. “Chandler told me you’re really into subscription boxes,” he says, and Noemie bobs her head in a nod. He takes out his phone, swipes through some photos. “I did one of those for cocktails a few years ago. That’s the only reason I have a somewhat decent cart.” “I’ve gotten that one! It’s great.” The two of them start comparing their monthly boxes, chattering away. This whole thing is surreal, my best friend and my . . . whatever Finn is. Collaborator doesn’t sound quite right, and yet neither
