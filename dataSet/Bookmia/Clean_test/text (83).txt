says at last, “I’m honored to have an official of such integrity here to preside over the proceedings. All the parties are present.” “Then we will begin at once,” my father says. Hearing this, Lady Kuo quickly steps forward. “Let me first show you to a room where you can refresh yourself from your journey,” she offers, to which my father nods his agreement. Although he had seemed in a hurry to get started, nearly an hour passes before Lady Kuo escorts my father to the same colonnade where the first inquest about Spinster Aunt took place. My mother-in-law’s bow is deep and respectful. He’s a dignitary and an honored guest, but I’ve never before seen her act so humbly. I’m further surprised when he touches her sleeve, leans toward her, and whispers a few words. She tightens her jaw, nods, and then backs away. My father takes his place at a table, where he’s flanked by his secretaries, each of whom has paper, brushes, and an inkstone before him. Spinster Aunt’s exhumed body lies on a table, covered with muslin. A diagram showing the front and back outlines of a body stands on an easel. Next to this is a small table with the tools required for an inquest on one end and brush and ink on the other end. Doctor Wong sits on one of two chairs placed between my father and his secretaries and Spinster Aunt’s body, facing the audience.

Most of the other chairs are filled by Yang men, but a few women, including Lady Kuo, are also seated. Miss Chen has been summoned. She’s in an alcove, with a gauze veil covering her face to hide her few scars. Next to her are other nonfamily women: Meiling, her mother, and Poppy. Meiling and I give each other a subtle nod. My father begins with some preliminaries, noting the day, month, and year of the Hongzhi emperor’s reign. His secretaries keep their heads down as they write every word spoken to create the official record. My father then announces that he’ll follow the rules and directions laid down in The Washing Away of Wrongs as he considers the forensic evidence, quoting: “If even one tiny mistake is made, the repercussions can stretch ten thousand li.” He pauses to let us consider these words, which were spoken to us years ago by Magistrate Fu. “This is an unusual situation, since we have two accusations of crimes before us,” my father goes on. “The first dates back fourteen years to the death of Yang Fengshi—a woman known by her family as Spinster Aunt. The second allegation regards the deliberate use of abortifacients—with the resulting death of a fetus and near death of
