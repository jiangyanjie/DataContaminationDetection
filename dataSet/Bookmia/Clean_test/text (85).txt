the rest of my life looking backward, reliving the endless days and nights when my mother was dying and I couldn’t be with her. 22 The Priority Mail boxes begin arriving in June. Packed and shipped by my aunts, each box is stuffed with photos, documents, correspondence, religious items, knickknacks, jewelry. Sometimes I let them sit for days before I feel able to sift through the contents. Sometimes I tear them open at once, hoping to find items to show my family. One holds my mother’s jewelry boxes, her high school diploma, her senior photo, and the stub of a ticket to a Simon & Garfunkel concert she’d once told me about, her eyes shining: It was the best live concert I’ve ever seen. In another, amid old family photographs I have never seen before, I find Mom’s wallet and driver’s license, a bill from the attorney who’d represented my parents in my adoption, and a copy of the will she had written only months before. There’s a wooden box full of bead necklaces: black and white, turquoise, yellow, royal blue, celadon green. Did she wear all of these? I wonder. Any of them? The only necklace I can recall seeing around her neck, at least in recent years, is her sterling-silver Orthodox cross with the dark blue inlay.

Though I know we’ll never wear them, I can’t bring myself to get rid of them, or anything else that belonged to her or my dad. The boxes, once opened, pile up in my office. I find notes I wrote to my mom when I was five, large print crammed into hand-drawn hearts: Dear Mom, Well, how are you? How was work? Fine I hope! Sarra and me had a good time. Well, bye, love you. I find cards made for her decades later, by my own kids: Dear Grandma, Thank you for the gifts and treats! We miss you. We hope we can visit you soon. I find old report cards, paintings, postcards we sent to her, a heart-shaped cardboard picture frame I decorated in either second or fourth grade by gluing hundreds of painted pasta shells into place, just so. I find my father’s Cleveland Browns shot glass, which I recall him using as a toothpick holder. I find a letter from my mother to my father, trying to mend a rift after a fight, and it feels like something I should never have seen. Toward the bottom of one box, I find Mom’s brand-new passport, the one she had renewed for her planned trip to Greece. She was going to go with her friends the year Dad
