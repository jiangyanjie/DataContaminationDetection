removal of a distraction. Athena…would never forgive Maurice, but even if she killed him back, that doesn’t do me any good at all. Just how bad is the friction between those two? While I’m thinking this, he wakes up and starts swearing at me. I tape up his mouth and call Orhan back because we didn’t finish our conversation. “Tell me about Denton.” “Throws his weight around, thinks that’s how Titans do,” Orhan says. “In fairness he’s sort of right about that.” “Your guy got a bonus from a consultancy contract he had. Corporate hospitality account. I’m looking at it now but I can already tell you it’s a shell.” “Was it a big bonus?” “Depends who you are. But for you and me, it was fucking huge.” “You got any kind of sense of what lives in the shell?” “Another shell and another. But the lawyers are Dietrich Hellawil in Chersenesos.” Right around the corner from the Tonfamecasca company. Figure if I go there and lie to them they will show me their exterior security tapes and I will recognise Maurice coming in that day. I say goodbye to Orhan and sit down behind my desk. I look at Maurice. “Who was Roddy Tebbit?” No answer. I get myself a glass of water and sit down again. “What happened with Peter and Lillian?” No reply. “When I got beat down the other day, Stefan said he just noticed I was coming in, but I don’t think that’s true. Did you play him, Maurice? Just happen to drop my name?” A thought occurs to me, really late in the game. “You were trying to use me to score points against Athena.” There’s something in my throat. Figure it must be rage. Maurice looks back at me through narrow eyes. He’s full of the same thing, viscous and violent. There’s a lot of fight hormones in this room. A lot of inhalable bad decisions. Get smart, Cal. Think. I drink some water and say some affirmations in my head. There’s a yoga class across the street, and in the summer, with the windows open, I can hear the things they murmur as they salute the sun. I am a calm person. I am not governed by negative emotions. Rage and pain wash over me as the river washes over the stone. They polish the surface of my serenity, but I remain as I am. To pass the time while I wait for the surface of my serenity to get all shiny, I talk to Maurice a bit more. “From where I’m standing it looks like you paid Mac Denton to fuck me up at Victor’s and when that didn’t work you made sure Stefan saw I was coming in so he’d do it for you. I’m wondering whether I’m gonna find out that Officer Mullen was yours, too, and Mac was just to distract me. Was it all to knock Athena off her game, Maurice? Get your job back?” Two dark eyes staring at me from the floor. Dark as Othrys, and as
