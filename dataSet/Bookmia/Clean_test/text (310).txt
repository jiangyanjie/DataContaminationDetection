a conversation, or when I’m saying goodbye to someone. I always make sure I say it.” “Who do you say it to?” “Oh, not everyone. Friends and family. People I love.” “And maybe people you want to love you back?” I don’t answer. “Do they verbally reciprocate?” she asks. “Actually, do they ever say it first?” “I’m sure they do. I just remember it always being a response.” “What about your parents?” Angelina asks. “Did they say it often?” “I never heard them say it to each other. Is that weird?” Angelina slowly closes her notebook and gently says, “There is no weird, Maddie. Every individual’s experience is unique. Did they ever say it to you?” I shift in my seat. “Say what? That they love me?” I nod. “Of course. Well, my dad did twice. Once when he was drunk and another when he was … unwell. I think his brain had forgotten itself. A little loose and addled with medication at the time, you know? But I know he loved me; you can’t not love your children, especially the unproblematic ones.” “And your mother?” “Yes, she must have.” I think of all the compliments Mum’s given me; she calls me darling, her baby, and a blessing. They’re all the same thing as love. “I tend to end our phone calls with ‘I love you.’” “So, again, you initiate?” I begin tapping my foot because my stomach feels like it has no lining. “I’m sure she has said it first on multiple occasions, I just can’t remember. She’s not a bad mother.” “I didn’t say she was.” I close my eyes and shake my head. “I’m sorry. I thought these sessions were going to be about my dad passing away and the grieving process.” “They are,” Angelina says. “But you cannot hope to understand an end without starting at the beginning.” “My mum does love me.” “I didn’t say she did not,” Angelina replies. “I’m saying the opposite, rather.” Bringing my hands together, I feel my pulse jump. “I think you know your mother loves you,” Angelina begins, “but your uncertainty may stem from a lack of convention, of the typical. How someone shows you they love you has less to do with you and all to do with them. There are healthy and unhealthy expressions of love and not all of them should be accepted.” This is meant to be about my mum, but I think about Dad and how I used to believe that if someone loved you, they had to say it, otherwise it wasn’t real, it wasn’t known, but I understand now that’s not the case. My dad rarely said those special three words, whether due to his upbringing, his stoic generation, whatever, but I always knew, inexplicably, that he did. “Many assume love is straightforward,” Angelina continues, “when really it is the most complicated of things. There is a right way, a preferred way, for each individual, to love and be loved by someone—but there isn’t only one way. I believe the difficulty of life has
