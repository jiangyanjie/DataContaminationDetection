realized he knew I hadn’t gone to the movies. Heading to the garage was just a way of throwing me off his trail.” I get her gist. Instead of entering through the back, he went to the garage before going around to the front of the house and using the main door. “I marched right into that house, ready to catch the two of them in the act and then tell Winston Hope exactly what his daughter was doing with my husband. I was certain he’d pay up. After firing Ricardo, of course. And probably me, as well. Which was even more reason to try to get as much money as I could.” “But it didn’t work out that way.” “No,” Berniece says quietly. “It didn’t.” I glance at my watch. My five minutes are up. But I can’t leave. Not until I hear the full story. Trying to move her along, I say, “What happened when you went inside?” “I got as far as the kitchen before that bitch ran in.” I can only assume the bitch in question is Lenora. “She looked scared,” Berniece says. “At first I thought it was because of me.

I was too scared to do anything else. But I knew something awful was happening inside that house. It wasn’t until the police came that I realized just how awful it really was.” Berniece looks down at her lap, ashamed. “I think about that moment a lot. If I’d refused to go, maybe Lenora would have killed me on the spot. Or maybe the other killings wouldn’t have happened. Maybe some of them could have been saved. Especially the younger daughter. Virginia. The poor thing. In such a state, too.” “Why didn’t you tell the police any of this?” “Because I wanted to protect Ricardo,” Berniece says, a catch in her throat. “I knew it wasn’t just Lenora responsible for those murders. Ricardo was part of it, too. He had to be. Because he never came back to the cottage. Not that night. Not ever. Once he disappeared, I knew deep
