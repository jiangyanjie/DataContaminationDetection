him?” Hap asked the Coachman. The Coachman shrugged. “I trust Bernard to know that if he screws us over, I have enough blackmail material on him to get him censured. Or worse, decommissioned.” “I never want to see your face again,” Bernard told him. “After today, we’re even.” The Coachman patted him on one of his arms. “You say that now, but you’ll miss me in a hundred years or so.” “I highly doubt it.” His head stopped spinning as he approached the crate. The screen on the top came to life as he tapped a finger against it. The crate shuddered and shook before it collapsed completely, unfolding until it lay flat on the ground. The Coachman took Nurse Ratched by one of her tentacles, leading her onto the crate. “I’ll have to lay you on your back,” he told her, a mischievous twitch to his mustache. “I promise to make it as pleasant as possible.” “You old flirt,” Nurse Ratched said in her flat voice. “I know your type.” The Coachman grinned at her. “I bet you do.” He grunted as he tipped her over, her screen facing the ceiling. “Do protect him, won’t you? He’s … precious.” “I know,” Nurse Ratched said. “Coachman?” “Yes, my sweet?” “If we are betrayed, if Bernard attempts to notify anyone of our presence in the city, I will find a way out.

He turned to stalk away, but paused at the last second, face twisting. He turned back around again and bent over Rambo. Vic was stunned when he said, “I t-tolerate your existence.” He took one of Rambo’s pincers in his hand and moved it up and down. “Whoa,” Rambo whispered as Hap let go. “Nurse Ratched, did you hear that? He loves me too!” “Th-that’s not what I said.” “It is. And you can’t take it back!” “I am going to die in this box,” Nurse Ratched said. Bernard stepped forward, extending an arm toward the screen. He tapped it once more, and the crate walls rose around Nurse Ratched and Rambo. The last Vic saw of them was Rambo waving frantically. “Goodbye,” Vic said quietly as the lid closed over them. Bernard motioned toward
