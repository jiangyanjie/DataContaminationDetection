easily attainable for the small-minded man. I skip my visits to Grandmother and Meiling. I don’t want them to know my humiliation. I’m determined to hold on to Maoren and keep him to myself. I recall the illustrated books I saw before my wedding. On those nights that Maoren does come to my room, I surprise him with new twisting and turning. It’s exciting and different, but my monthly moon water comes again. A profound disappointment… We go back to the usual ways of most husbands and wives. It’s all so routine and sad that it takes a couple of weeks for me to notice that even my husband’s fascination with my feet has vanished. Then he begins to sleep in his library, saying he wants to put his effort into his next attempt at the imperial exams. That’s when I realize it’s only a matter of time before my mother-in-law will do her duty and bring in a concubine. I feel myself slipping into the syndrome my grandmother always warns me about. I keep up with Ailan’s footbinding, but I lose interest in Yuelan’s and Chunlan’s embroidery and other domestic skills. Then the worst comes to pass. My mother-in-law finds a concubine for Maoren. I stay in my room, refusing to meet the girl. Poppy tells me she’s fourteen and exceptionally beautiful: “She’s called Snowpink, and her cheeks are as lovely as the pink of sunrise on freshly fallen snow.” I curl into a ball. Despair. Failure.

Who knows how Maoren will react to his mother’s gift? Maybe he won’t like the girl. But my battle with myself is doomed, because what man wouldn’t like someone fresh, young, obedient, and malleable? A few days later, Maoren comes to my room in the late afternoon. He holds a letter sealed with wax. It’s addressed to me, but he opens it and scans to the end. “Lady Liu has written to you,” he says. “She wants you to know that her mother is as mentally sharp as before her troubles began.” He looks to me for an explanation, but I don’t give one. “Lady Liu’s sister-in-law… It says here she suffered damage from weeping?” Again he peers at me, but I’d never tell him about what I discussed with Lady Liu and Widow Bao. “I’m happy to inform you that the sister-in-law is much improved after three months, just as you said she would be. She also thanks you for introducing her to Young Midwife. She writes that there will be news forthcoming in that regard.” While this information lifts my spirits briefly, I’m too defeated to ask to see the letter myself. There’s more to
