to show its age. Will they both be thrown out? Will Second Uncle keep the girl to raise as an amusement for the boys in the household or sell her to a Tooth Lady? Neither of these futures will come to pass if the girl dies. “Would your mama let you visit me in my room tomorrow?” “I think so.” “Why don’t you ask her?” I encourage. I bet that Yining used to love to run, because even with her feet bound I sense restrained eagerness in her steps as she walks to the cluster of concubines. Second Uncle’s first concubine smiles when she sees her daughter. Her manner—even more than Yining’s pulse—is proof of my diagnosis. While Yining implores her mother, I place my fingertips on my wrist. Grandmother has always said that only a fool is a doctor to herself, but what else can I do? I read the three levels of pulses and come to the same conclusion I did yesterday and the day before that. My qi and Blood are growing more deficient. With a sigh, I let my fingers fall back to my lap. As the hours spool out, some women switch to painting, while others compose poetry. I’ve never been good at these pursuits. In the late afternoon, women begin to retire to their own chambers—the wives to make sure their children are fed, and each concubine to prepare in case she’s to be her master’s chosen one tonight. As soon as Lady Kuo leaves, I go to my room. Until Maoren comes for dinner, I’ll be alone. In the mornings my thoughts go to Grandmother and our lessons. This time of day I spend with Meiling. In my mind, I transport myself back to my bedchamber in the Mansion of Golden Light. I see her before me clearly. I can smell her hair and the jasmine tea we were drinking. We are thirteen years old.

Her voice was even in her reading, and her written characters showed improvement. When our secret lessons are finished, we go outside to our favorite spot—the bridge overlooking the stream in the fourth courtyard. “There were acrobats and archers, storytellers and puppeteers,” Meiling recounts, her eyes wide as she tells me about a festival she and her mother attended to celebrate cherry-blossom season in the hills above Lake Tai. I ask my favorite question. “What did you eat?” “Scallion pancakes and grilled meat from a stand. So tasty!” “What else did you do?” “Mama and I walked to the pagoda.” I take her hand and hold it over my heart. We stay this way in quiet companionship, listening to the trickle of water over rocks in the stream and the breeze soughing through the trees. “It’s been a while since our last visit,” she says at last. “Are you ready for me to feed your nightmares?” “I never have nightmares!” I protest, although her stories do make
