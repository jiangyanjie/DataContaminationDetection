and it’s instantly, violently, mortifyingly present in my mind that the last time we met, I acted like a toddler with little bitch disorder. “I . . .” I look around like an idiot, in search of . . . what? A teleprompter? This is mortally embarrassing. “I didn’t know you were here.” “Just got here. Faculty meeting ran late for no reason—the entire thing could be summarized in two fifteen-second TikToks.” She shrugs, moving closer. I clutch my almond wrapper like it’s a terry cloth monkey. “Georgina—” “George, please. Georgina is my mother. And my grandmother. My greatgrandmother, too, probably. We should invest in a baby names book.” “Oh.” I clear my throat. My contributions to this conversation are priceless. “Jack’s in there, if you—” “I know. Like I could miss him when he’s standing next to Adam Carlsen. They’re the Mount Rushmore of STEM academia. Anyway—will you have lunch with me next week? I want to chat with you, but not in Sunny’s home.” She shudders. “I can’t be in here without thinking of the urine sample.” Professionally, my life sucks a bit. Psychologically, I’m not, as some would say, “healthy.” Musically, I should hire a tuba to follow me around. But on the upside, I’ve been killing it in the lunch invite department. “You want to chat with me,” I repeat. Just to be sure. “Yes. Partly because Jack is my closest friend, and it would bug him if I stole you from him even just a bit. But mostly because the last time we met, I acted like a total bitch, and I want to make it up to you.” What? “No, no, I’m the one who ran away like a lunatic. My first reaction to finding out that you’d gotten the job was unforgivable and incredibly messed up. I acted like a bitch—” “Yes, you totally did.” George’s smile is triumphant. “To make it up to me, you will let me take you out for lunch.” “That’s . . .” I slow-blink. “Very well played.” “Thank you.” She dusts nonexistent specks off her shoulder, and I laugh. “I see why Jack likes you so much.” “I see why Jack likes you more.” Her smile softens. “Next Wednesday okay?” I nod. “Sounds great.” Jack and I leave a few minutes later. I exchange numbers with Olive, and Sunny hugs me goodbye while Jack is getting the car, whispering that any urine sample rumors I might have heard have been greatly exaggerated. She also swears that if Jack and I break up, she’ll side with me, because she already likes me more. I laugh on the doorstep. “It makes me feel guilty for stealing your almonds.” “Oh, they must be someone else’s. No nuts in this house—they’re, like, so gross.” In the car, I’m contemplating the idea that Jack researched, bought, and packed a diabetes-friendly snack just for me when he asks, “Where to for dinner?” “Oh.” Something happy and surprised flips in my chest at the idea of the night not being over yet. “I like everything.” He
