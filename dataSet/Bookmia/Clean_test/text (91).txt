She’s wearing her circular glasses today and recently cut her brown hair into a bob. Teamed with her five-foot-two height and wind-painted cheeks, she looks younger than her forty-seven years. “Morning, Katherine. How was your weekend?” “Lovely, thanks. David and I caught the penultimate performance of Closer Still at the Lyceum—have you seen it?” “No, not yet.” I never will; remaining tickets, last time I checked, cost somewhere in the three-figure bracket. “Would you recommend it?” “Oh, definitely.” She unbuttons her blazer and crosses her legs at the ankles. “It was brilliant—you really have to try to catch the final show on Thursday.” Claire, the general manager, walks in and asks, “Is this Closer Still?” Her dark ponytail swings like a pendulum even when she stops and she has her work shoes in her hands, ready to swap out her trainers. “Incredible, wasn’t it?” I leave them to their conversation and return to my emails—mostly people asking for Katherine’s time. The simple answer is she doesn’t have any and they know this, but they also know that Katherine suffers famously from FOMO (fear of missing out). On a senior level where she is one of only two women, she feels she can’t turn any meeting down, so she instructs me to find the time, even if it’s during her lunch hour. A couple of weeks ago, she was diagnosed with depression. She told those working directly under her, then told me herself after she’d accidentally copied me into an email to HR explaining why she’d need time off. Despite a month’s leave being granted, she returned to work the following week and took to smiling in front of us and crying in the toilets, returning with red eyes and puffy cheeks. No one did anything about it. Claire even pulled me aside and told me not to mention it to anyone because if even one of the eleven (out of thirteen) male directors found out that “Katherine couldn’t cope,” they’d think her too weak for her position. “Does that really matter?” I asked. “I mean, what they’ll think of her? Katherine’s not well.” “Of course it matters,” Claire said. She barely reined in an eye roll before replacing it with folded arms. “Even though she does more and works harder than any of them, they’ll replace her with yet another man if they find out she’s depressed. She and I have seen it happen twice already. Why don’t you make her a cup of tea?” she suggested. “Katherine will be fine in an hour.” Claire was wrong. “Morning, Maddie.” Ellie’s next to arrive. She too rushes in, but likely because she woke up late; her blond hair is scraped back, she’s missed a button on her corduroy dungarees and her Converse lace has come undone. She sits and lets out a breath of air. “Morning, Ellie.” Ellie’s my line manager, even though she started after me and is only a year older. We were friendlier at first, joked around a bit more, but that dried up like the arse of a prune
