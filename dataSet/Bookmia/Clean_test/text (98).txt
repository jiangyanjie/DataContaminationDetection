and to medicine. From my mother, in particular, I learned that in medicine we must look at the entire cosmos—both within and without the body. Are they in harmony?” He gestures to me. “What pride I have in this moment to see that my daughter has learned to see these patterns not only in those who ail but in the world around her, which is how she was able to bring this matter to me. Just as my daughter or my parents might have felt the pulses, asked questions, and so on, I now follow a similar course to find what in the evidence is out of harmony with the cosmos and what traces have been left behind that reveal past movements.” My father pauses so his secretaries can take down all his words. Once their brushes stop moving, he picks up again. “Fame is a dream some men chase. Sometimes they catch it and manage to hold on to it as if hanging on to the tail of a kite in a tempest. Sometimes they are blinded by desire for recognition or influence, as if they have drunk a flask of fairy wine. We are talking about the basic elements of yin and yang, are we not? The constant push and pull between good and evil, love and hate, honor and disgrace, all of which follow each other in an unending cycle. In this case, Doctor Wong, you were not alone in your misdeeds. I now ask Midwife Shi and Miss Chen to stand next to you.” Once the two women are in place, my father says, “All punishments are dictated by the Great Ming Code: beheading, banishment, penal servitude, and flogging.” Hearing these words, Midwife Shi seems resigned. Miss Chen stays silent beneath her veil. Doctor Wong goes pale, perhaps reconsidering his choice of the coward’s way. “I will begin with Midwife Shi,” my father goes on. “The punishment for lying at an inquest is severe—one hundred blows with a heavy rod.” “No!” Meiling cries out. This is far worse than what she received at the palace. My father ignores the outburst. “While the Great Ming Code says I can’t suspend a sentence, it can be reduced, which I believe is warranted in this case. After all, Midwife Shi—as a woman and as one of the Six Grannies—could not disobey Doctor Wong’s orders. At the same time, we must admire her Confucian fealty. She sacrificed her reputation to secure her daughter’s future. That daughter—another member of the Six Grannies—has also exhibited the precepts of Confucius. In helping to expose Doctor Wong, Young Midwife has helped clear her mother’s name. Midwife Shi will receive one hundred blows from the lightest bamboo rod available in the district.” Hearing the sentence, Meiling’s mother remains as still as stone. Miss Chen’s veil—light and diaphanous—trembles. “As for Miss Chen,” my father says, “she is property. I leave her punishment to Master Yang. But if it were me, I’d have the concubine banished from the household immediately.” He couldn’t know that Miss Chen has already been
