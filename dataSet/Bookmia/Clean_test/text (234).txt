at all. * * * — When I’ve finished my coffee with Gratton I go up onto my rooftop and get the doc box, then walk it across town to Tonfamecasca Tower. Doublewide will be pissed as hell, but that’s too bad. This isn’t leverage on Stefan, and he can’t have it. I tell the security guy I want to see Stefan, and he laughs. “Not happening, my man.” “Sure,” I tell him. “I’ll wait.” Security guy is about to tell me I won’t, but that’s as long as it takes. The call comes through to let me up. He wants to scan the doc box, but I flat palm his chest and walk right on by. I get into the elevator and don’t push a button. It moves anyway. Stefan is sitting at the enormous desk. He doesn’t get up. I walk across the room and put the doc box down beside him. “You’re an idiot,” I say, and Stefan nods. “You would feel that way. I’m sure you think I should have told you the whole story at the beginning.” “No.” He raises his eyebrows. “No?” “No. It’s private business. You could have saved me some time, but…whatever. Time doesn’t mean that much to you, does it? You’re an idiot because you saved him.” Dr. Lillian Antonin, a researcher at the Tonfamecasca company, was first treated with T7 at Demeter Mercy on September 9th. But on the same day, according to the company files, Dr. Peter Jens Antonin was admitted to a private room at Asclepius General and treated by an external team. He also received T7, which healed his broken bones, increased his physical mass, and left him screaming for day upon day until the regular staff broke in and anaesthetised him. Stefan shrugs. “He was a resource, Cal. He really did understand the drug in some special instinctive way. Had a knack for it. I wanted to keep the scientist and lose the man. I failed, of course. I got Roddy instead. We’ve done a lot of work on T7 amnesia since then; perhaps today he wouldn’t be such a patchwork of lost pieces and inventions. Although after she hit him with that steel, the bleed probably did a lot of the damage. And I rather enjoyed Roddy, over the years. He was so achingly persistent, so honest and determined. It was like my very own serial television show: the wronged drifter moving from town to town in search of evidence he will never find, doing good along the way. Falling in love, even, from time to time. And all that, with a delicious wash of irony that only I could see: compulsive viewing. Well, I suppose all things must end. Except me, of course. Is that his liver?” “No, I brought you steaks.” “Ah. Bathos. Very good, Cal. Well done.” “Did you kill him?” Stefan rumbles in his chest, and I realise it’s a chuckle. He’s keeping it in, because he’s in a good mood. “Don’t be absurd. Think of the algal perfusion or whatever it was,
