She glanced over her shoulder to see the nurse standing at the foot of his bed. “Yes. I was with him when it happened,” Iris whispered, beginning to back away. She could see Attie at the corner of her eye, waiting in the doorway. “Then he must be here because of you,” the nurse said, moving closer to take his pulse. “I’m sure he’ll want to see and personally thank you tomorrow.” “No,” Iris said. “I’m here because of him.” And that was all the lump in her throat would allow her to say. She turned and left the room, her breaths turning shallow and quick, and she thought she might faint in the corridor until she glanced up and saw someone striding toward her with purpose. Long black hair was escaping a braid. Blood was splattered on her skirts and fire shone in her brown eyes. Marisol. “There you are!” Marisol cried, and Iris worried she was in trouble until she realized that that Marisol was crying.

She could suddenly feel the keen edge of her exhaustion. She carried a candle into her bedroom. She dropped the bags from her back to the floor, where they lay like two heaps on the rug. She stripped, shivering as the bloodstained linen peeled off her skin. A quick shower, Marisol had told her. Because it was the middle of the night, and they must always be ready for the hounds to come. Iris washed by candlelight. It was dark and warm, the steam curling up from the tiles, and she stood in the shower, her eyes closed and her skin burning as she scrubbed. She scrubbed as if she could wash it all away. Her ears still held a faint ring; she wondered if it would ever fade. She knocked something off the soap ledge. The clang made her jump, her heart faltering. She almost cowered,
