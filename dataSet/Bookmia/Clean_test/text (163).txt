I say. “There’s nothing to mess up.” His lips part. I wish I could roll the words back into my mouth and down my throat. “If that’s what you were getting at.” “Okay,” he says. Okay? What kind of response is that? After a beat of awkward silence, he says, “I’m not either.” I suppress a smile. “You’re not in a long-distance relationship with my coworker you’ve met once?” An irresistible blush hits the tops of his cheekbones. He knocks his foot against the leg of the air hockey table. “I can hardly believe it myself. The chemistry was undeniable, but it wasn’t enough.” I swallow the second half of a laugh, and he looks up at me from under that one lock of his. “There’s no one else,” he says. It doesn’t matter, I tell myself. It can’t matter. He wasn’t happy with you. He broke your heart. He was never yours to keep, and deep down you knew that. I watched him fade from me, bit by bit, day by day, a mirage receding into nothingness. But the way he’s looking at me threatens to obliterate logic, to erase history. If he’s a black hole, I’ve reached his event horizon. My chest aches, but I don’t want it to stop. I want to lean into the feeling, this wholeness. My heart and body and mind are all finally in the same time and place. Here, with him. I don’t want to go back into the theater, but something has to give. We can’t keep walking out along this tightrope, or someone’s going to get hurt. I’m going to get hurt. I clear my throat. “How’s the furniture repair business?” His Cupid’s bow twitches. “Still a furniture repair business.” “Oh?” I say. “Not using it to run drugs and host illegal gambling nights yet?” His lips split into a smile. “Still in the same apartment?” Our apartment. It still manages to hold traces of him. Or maybe that’s me, carrying his ghost around wherever I go. “Mhm.” “How’s your sister?” he asks. “Good, I think,” I say. “She and her hairdresser friend went into business together. They mostly do weddings and dances. Still FaceTimes me twice a month, makes about five minutes of small talk, then says goodbye.” His teeth skate over his bottom lip. “I’m sorry.” He’s the only person who knows how much it bothers me that I barely know Eloise, that despite having a sister, I always felt acutely alone in our childhood home. Between our six-year age gap and her constant disagreements with our parents, we didn’t have much time to bond. I shrug. “Some things never change, and the best thing is to stop hoping they will.” “Other things do, though,” he says. I break eye contact. “What about your sisters? How are they?” “Good,” he replies, half smiling. “Lou’s with my mom this week. Said to tell you hi.” I smile despite the twinge in my chest. “And Michael? Still in Colorado?” He nods. “She’s dating another aerospace engineer, who works for a competing company.
