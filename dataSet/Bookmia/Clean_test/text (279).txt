cousins and friends. So I spent the hors d’oeuvres portion of the evening nursing a glass of champagne and heartily doing that thing where you never, ever look at the only person you want to look at. That thing where you pretend to not even be aware of the only person you’re aware of. That thing where you give an Oscar-level performance of being totally, utterly, blissfully fine because the person watching you from across the party never kissed you senseless and then broke your heart. Did that even happen? Because you sure as hell don’t remember it. You’re too fabulous to remember it. You and your ruffly dress and your flirty new rooftop companion are far, far too awesome for a thing like being dumped—and then ghosted and then treated with contempt—to even matter. Daniel turned out to be highly accomplished at flirting—and then it didn’t take that long before his face delighted me by coming into focus. “Oh, hello,” I said, with a frisson of delight when it happened. “There you are.” “Here I am,” Daniel agreed gamely, with no clue what I meant. “You are cuter than Sue said,” I said. At that, Daniel laughed and gave me a side squeeze, and that’s when I looked up to see Joe watching us. “Say something funny,” I said to Daniel real quick. “Like what?” Daniel asked. And then I burst out laughing like that was it. Then Daniel laughed because I was laughing. When we settled, Daniel said, “So. That guy who’s been watching you this entire time? Are you trying to make him jealous?” Joe had been watching me this entire time? That felt like a sad little victory. “Yes, please,” I said. “Let’s go dance, then,” Daniel said, nodding at the empty floor. “I don’t think it’s time for that yet,” I said, glancing over at Mrs. Kim, not wanting to mess up her schedule. “Oh, it’s definitely not,” Daniel said. Then he gave me a nod. “Even better.” And that’s how I wound up slow-dancing with Sue’s cute cousin, adding another kind of triumph to the evening, until the caterers started serving dinner. I then made my way toward the tables to find my place card and discovered that Mrs. Kim did not get the Joe memo—and she had seated us right next to each other. The place cards were in Korean and English. The English on mine read Sadie. And the one in front of the empty chair next to me read Helpful. Mr. Kim, you adorable troublemaker. Joe walked up next to me, read his own place card, and realized the same thing. We turned and met eyes. Did I say he was heartbreaking from across the roof? Up close, he was worse. Those lips. That jaw. Those eyes. I’d seen them all before—in pieces. And here they were, miraculously together and adding up to far more than the sum of their parts. “Sadie,” Joe said, acknowledging me with a nod. “Joe,” I acknowledged back—noting how odd it was to know that for sure. And
