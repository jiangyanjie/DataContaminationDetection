her as she prodded his hip. “Ffeelings.” “Yes,” Dad said, finally looking up. He settled back on his heels, dirt under his fingernails as he rested his hands on his thighs. “Feelings.” “H-how?” “We watch. We learn. We process. It wasn’t always this way. But the more complex our minds became, the more choice we were given. Evolution by way of mimicry.” “I d-don’t have feelings.” “So you say.” Dad looked troubled as he shook his head. “I will ask you a question. I want you to answer it as best you can.” Hap glanced at Vic before turning to face Gio. “What.” “What is your designation?” Hap’s head jerked as if someone had swung at him. His mouth opened. No sound came out. He raised his hand in front of his face, looking at his wooden fingers. He said, “Hap. My d-designation is Hap.” “Is it?” “Yes. It was g-given to me. It’s m-mine.” “And you wouldn’t like to be called anything else.” “No.” “Why?” Dad asked. Hap’s face went slack momentarily before the skin under his eye twitched. “I d-don’t know.” “I do!” Rambo cried, arms waving. “I know why. Pick me. Pick me!” Dad chuckled ruefully. “Why, Rambo?” “Because a designation is a gift,” Rambo said. “It’s an identity. It sets us apart from others like us. It’s unique. In all of existence, there has never been someone named Rambo before me. But even if there were, I’m the best one.” “Precisely,” Dad said. “It gives you presence.” “Weight,” Hap said. “Heavy.” He pressed a hand to the side of his head. “And how does it make you feel?” Dad asked.

There is no g-good or b-bad.” “And does being called Hap make you feel different different?” “Yes.” “And you like it.” Hap said, “L-like the butterfly.” Vic didn’t know why he felt warm. It wasn’t validation. It wasn’t praise, especially since Hap looked pissed off about it, though that might have been his default expression. Vic wondered why anyone would create such a surly machine. “Hap,” he said. Hap looked at him. Vic fidgeted, shifting his weight from one foot to the other. “It’s a good name.” “Wh-why do you move like that?” Hap asked. “Are you malfunctioning?” “No,” Dad said before Vic could answer, and he was grateful for it. His tongue felt thick in his mouth, his throat dry. “He isn’t malfunctioning. He, like you, is different. It is part of his design.” Hap stared at Vic, his gaze boring into him. Then he started wringing his hands, hopping from one foot to the other in an odd approximation of Vic. “Stop,” Vic snapped. “Stop it.” Hap did. “Wh-why? You do it. I can do it.” “You are an asshole,” Nurse Ratched said. “I a-am an asshole.” “I like this game,” Rambo whispered. Then, louder, “Now say, ‘Rambo is my best friend.’” “N-no,” Hap said. Rambo’s arms drooped. “Aw. I thought that would work.” “I am
