hurried, like this is a timed activity and we’re in our final seconds. “What was the text,” I hiss out as our lips draw apart. “What text,” he asks, turning me back to the car, the warm metal of the hood meeting my back. “From your mom,” I say. “I saw a text from your mom.” “Nothing,” he says, lifting me onto the hood. “Wyn.” “It’s about work, Harriet,” he says, squeezing my thighs, pulling them around his hips. “That doesn’t make any sense,” I say as he kisses his way down my throat, hand curling against my ear. “I can explain it to you right now,” he says, “or we can have sex in the car.” A plumb line of heat drops through my center, my thighs tightening against him as he kisses me more deeply. “The car? We’re like a mile from the house.” “I don’t have a mile in me right now, Harriet.” I push against his shoulders even as the rest of my body strains toward him. “Tell me,” I say. He steps back. A car flies by our spot on the shoulder, and he blinks as if emerging from a trance. Then obvious anxiety torques his brow and mouth, and I am positive I made the right decision, that there’s something I need to know. With a resigned sigh, he pulls his phone out of his back pocket and taps on it for several seconds, teeth worrying at his lower lip, while the suspense pummels my nerves. Finally, he hands the phone to me. There’s a web browser open to some hip minimalistic shop. A white backdrop. Soft serifed headings: Gallery, Contact, Social Media.

Behind the meadow, periwinkle mountains jut up into a cloudless sky. It’s so beautiful it makes me ache.

Are you buying a fifteen-thousand-dollar table? Here I was freaking out about a coffee-table book, and you’re buying a millionaire’s table?” “What?” He laughs uncomfortably. “No. Harriet. It’s not—I’m not buying it . . . I made it.” I stare at him. “You . . .” I look back down to the table, then up at him. “You made this? Or you fixed it?” Color rises along his cheeks. “I made it. For that home goods store in Bozeman. Juniper and Sage?” Juniper and Sage. I went once with Wyn’s parents, and Hank joked that we shouldn’t touch any of their vases, because if we broke them, we’d have to mortgage the house. “They’re selling them on consignment,” Wyn says. “The
