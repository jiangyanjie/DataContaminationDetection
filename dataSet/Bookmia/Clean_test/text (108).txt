and rub your clit right away, but I’d make myself wait for it. I’d make you wait for it.” I clutch at him, trying to drag his mouth back to mine. But then he pauses. Pulls away, arching an eyebrow. “You gotta give me something,” he says. “I kind of feel like I’m doing the heavy lifting here.” Somehow, I manage to come up with the words. “I—I always get so wet for you,” I say, and that makes him hold me tighter. “Not just when we’re like this. I could be sitting next to you at a con and thinking about what we did the previous night. Or what I’d want to do the next night. I’ll get so turned on I can barely stand it, but I can’t do anything about it.” His head rolls back, and he lets out this fantastic groan. “That’s not just part of all this? You’re serious?” “Yes,” I exhale, wondering if I’m signing my own death warrant. If so, it’ll be a wonderful death. “Sometimes I’d have to get myself off before we met up to work, too, just to clear my head.” “What would you think about?” “The way your breath hitches when you touch me for the first time.” This is it. No inhibitions. “You, talking to me exactly like this.

I felt so fucking depraved—like I’d never be able to get enough of you.” It sounds so real that I need to hear him say it again. “Really?” He gives me this furrow of his brows. “You don’t think you’re irresistible?” he says. “I’ve always been attracted to you. Since we first met at that bookstore bar. When you were a petty thief.” I swat at his chest with my free hand. “I’ll have you know that I returned the book and felt so bad about it, I bought two more.” He grabs my hand, bringing it to his mouth. Presses kisses to my knuckles. “A real stand-up person. A Good Samaritan.” A little growl. “How does every part of you taste so good,” he says. “No one’s hands should taste this good.” He maneuvers me flat onto the bed, taking his time as he kisses down my body. Helping me out of my bra, sucking one nipple into his mouth while he thumbs the other, making me arch up off the bed. He doesn’t let up, tongue dipping into my navel and then
