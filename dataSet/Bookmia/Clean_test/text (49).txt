threads that drew him to Iris. It didn’t feel like fate; Roman didn’t quite believe in such fancies. But it certainly felt like something. Something that was now stealing his sleep and making his chest ache with each breath. “What’s she like?” Nan asked. “Daisy’s granddaughter?” Roman stared at his tea dregs. “I’m not sure. I don’t know her that well.” “In case you forgot, I can tell when you lie, Roman. You squint.” He only laughed, because hadn’t Iris said the very thing to him last week? “Very well, Nan. I would say she’s like her grandmother, then. Given your descriptions of Daisy.” “Is that so?” Nan fell quiet, pensive. “Hmm. Is that why you wanted the other half of my myth? To send it to…?” “Iris,” he whispered. His grandmother only arched her brow. But then she said, “Iris,” and the sound was so gentle it made Roman shiver. “Yes.” He thought it was time to leave, before she said anything else that made him uncomfortable. He was rising from the stool when his grandmother drawled, “And you’re going to let her slip away, then?” He froze. How was he to answer that? He said, “I don’t think I have much of a choice, Nan.” Nan puffed and swatted his hand. “There is always a choice. Are you going to let your father write your story, or will you?” He was silent as she rose with a slight grunt. Nan walked to the threshold but paused, and Roman tensed, uncertain what she was about to say. “I am seventy-five years old, Roman,” she began. “I’ve seen endless things throughout my life, and I can tell you right now that this world is about to change. The days to come will only grow darker. And when you find something good? You hold on to it. You don’t waste time worrying about things that won’t even matter in the end. Rather, you take a risk for that light. Do you understand what I’m telling you?” He nodded, although his heart was racing. “Good,” his nan said. “Now wash those cups, or else Cook will fuss about the mess.” And then she was gone. The kitchen shadows felt deeper without her as Roman carried the pot and cups to the sink, realizing that he had never once in his life washed any dishes. He did his best, setting the porcelain back into the cupboard before he retreated to his room, where he glanced at the wardrobe. Still no letter. He slid down to the floor and dozed at last. When he stirred at first light, he saw she had finally written to him. Roman scrambled over the rug, his pulse hammering in his throat as he unfolded her letter and read: I’m safe and well. Don’t worry! I apologize for having to abruptly leave last night. I don’t have time to write a long letter this morning as I need to go. It’s back to the infirmary today, but I’ll write you soon. P.S. I’m hoping to send you more soldier letters this
