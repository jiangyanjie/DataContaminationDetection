freshly tilled garden and down the next street over, into the golden field that Iris could see from her bedroom window. The grass was long, touching their knees as they walked side by side. They were far enough away from the town that they could speak freely, but close enough that they could easily make it to shelter if a siren went off. To Iris’s surprise, Attie didn’t ask for details on what she was writing about, or why it was coming so slowly and arduously. She asked, “Where do you think Marisol’s wife is?” “Keegan? Marisol said she was traveling, didn’t she?” Iris replied, fingers tracing wispy seed heads. “I assume she’s in Oath, or perhaps another city up north.” Attie was quiet for a moment, squinting against the late afternoon sun. “Maybe. I just have this strange feeling Marisol is lying to us.” That gave Iris pause. “Why would she need to lie to us about that?” “Maybe lie is the wrong word. Mislead is better suited, because she’s trying to protect herself and her wife.” “Protect them from what?” “I don’t know,” Attie said. “But something feels odd.” “I feel like Marisol would tell us if it was important,” Iris replied. “Yes. I think she would too. Perhaps I’m only imagining it.” They strode farther down the field, and just the movement of walking after sitting crunched at her desk most of the day lifted Iris’s demeanor. There was nothing but the sound of grass whispering against their legs, and a few starlings trilling overhead. No matter how long she lived here, she didn’t think she would ever get used to how quiet it was. “Do you think it’s possible to fall in love with a stranger?” Iris asked. “Like love at first sight?” “Not exactly. More like loving someone you’ve never met. Someone whose name you don’t even know but who you have a connection with.” Attie was quiet for a beat. “I’m not sure. Maybe? But only because I’m a romantic at heart.” And she cast a wry smile Iris’s way. “Why do you ask? Has a stranger caught your eye at the infirmary?” “No. It’s just something I’m currently thinking about.” Attie glanced up to the sky, as if the answers hid above them, high up in the clouds. The words she said next lingered with Iris for hours afterward. “These days, I think anything is possible, Iris.” Things I know about you: 1. You slouch sometimes. 2. You have your father’s chin. 3. Your hair is perfect, somewhere between rogue and knight errant. 4. You have a nan, who is full of myths. 5. You’re Del’s older brother. 6. You live in Oath. 7. You’re 19 (I think? I added up your age from a previous letter). 8. Your writing is impeccable and often makes me laugh. Things I don’t know about you: 1. Your name. Iris folded the paper and sent it over the portal that night. She waited, expecting him to reply swiftly, as he was prone to do. But when the minutes
