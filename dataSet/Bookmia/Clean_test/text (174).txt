would probably stop entirely by New Year’s Festival, but I hate for you to suffer from these aggravating symptoms.” Widow Bao’s complaints are normal for a woman her age, which is why I have the necessary pills on my shelf. I pour some of them into a silk bag and pull the ribbon to secure them inside. “These will alleviate your troubles. You’ll sleep better, and soon your monthly moon-water days will be behind you.” Widow Bao tucks the satchel inside her gown. “We mentioned we had double business to conduct on this trip. Let us discuss the second matter now. My daughter-in-law and I are also looking for midwives to bring to the capital. Your husband told us you have a friend who is a midwife. That surprised us.” “And made us curious,” Lady Liu says. “She must be special to move comfortably around, and be accepted by, someone such as you.” “My grandmother recognized this quality in Meiling at a young age.” After a moment, I add, “Would you like to meet her?” “We would be grateful for that,” Lady Liu says.

We’re only here to listen.” Meiling serves as the go-between, bringing Doctor Wong’s questions from behind the screen and sending the young wife’s detailed answers back to him. I’m proud of Meiling. Not only does she do a much better job at transmitting the messages than an embarrassed husband ever could, but she also carries herself well—showing equal respect to the doctor and to the patient. The young wife recently gave birth. She suffers from severe itching on her ears, cheeks, and the nape of her neck. She sobs, hiding her tears with her sleeves. “I’m lonely. My husband doesn’t listen to me. He pays no attention to my advice.” Meiling disappears behind the screen to pass on these words. Since Doctor Wong can’t see the patient, Meiling also describes the young woman’s red and scaled face and the patches where she’s scratched so
