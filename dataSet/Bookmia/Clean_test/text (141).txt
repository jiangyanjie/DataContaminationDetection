bringing her back to the present. “I’ve done things that I can barely live with. And I know you may want to leave me. I can see it in your eyes; you want to find Kitt and your other friends. But I need you. I’m asking you to stay here with me, where it’s safe.” She nodded, even though her heart was sinking. “I won’t leave you, Forest.” He closed his eyes, relieved. He looked like he had aged an entire decade. She caught a fleeting glimpse of him as an old man, worn and weathered and somber. “Get some sleep, brother,” she said. “We can talk more tomorrow.” She rose and left Forest on the sofa. The very place he had once slept before the war, when he was a horologist’s apprentice with bright eyes and a quick laugh and bear hugs that always made Iris feel better after a hard day. She took a candle and retreated to her bedroom, leaning against the door for a moment. She had to drop these fears about Roman, captured. Roman, dead. Roman, suffering. She had to have faith, and she needed to sleep. She needed her mind sharp and her body rested so she could forge a new plan to find her way to him.

She didn’t know if she was strong enough to open it. She worried it would break the last of her, to read his words now. In the end, she couldn’t resist. The paper unfolded like wings in her hands. His words met her like a blade. She bowed over them. Iris! Iris, it’s me, Kitt. Epilogue DACRE Dacre waited for his eithrals to retreat for the second time before he began his approach to Avalon Bluff. His pets returned to their resting place underground, and he walked across the lush valley, full of hope. The gas rose, limning the town in green. Green like the mountains, like the emeralds he wore on his fingers. Green like Enva’s eyes, which he still saw some nights when he slept below. The mortals
