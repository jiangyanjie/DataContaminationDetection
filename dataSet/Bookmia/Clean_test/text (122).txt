expecting Finn to have such a strong reaction, but his eyes instantly light up. “Yes! I love that.” My fingers fly across the keyboard as we talk more about his transition from Reno to LA, and he tells me about the first time he got recognized in public. “I was at a Ralphs in the Valley, waiting in line to buy an absolutely horrific array of groceries,” he says. “Pop-Tarts, frozen Red Robin onion rings, a whole tray of fancy cheeses I was going to eat by myself—that’s what happens when you’re twenty and living alone for the first time. These two girls who couldn’t have been more than a few years younger than I was couldn’t stop staring, and I was convinced they were judging me for what I was buying, so I kept trying to shield my basket from them. It wasn’t until we were out in the parking lot that they asked if I was Finn Walsh, and I was so shocked that I forgot where I’d parked my car. Walked around in a daze for fifteen minutes, just trying to find it.” “What was that like?” I ask, grinning at the mental image. “The getting recognized, and the living alone for the first time.” “Surreal. To be honest, I’m still not used to it. And not just because it’s less frequent these days. When the show was on, I had to go incognito just about everywhere—sunglasses, a hat, the works. Now I don’t bother with any of it. The rare times it happens, I’m always convinced, like, one of the Stranger Things kids is behind me and that’s who they’re really staring at.” That seems accurate, based on what I’ve observed so far. No one seems to know him unless they know him, unless they’re in that world. “And I guess I should clarify—I had a couple roommates at first, but they worked restaurants in the evenings and auditioned during the day, so I almost never saw them. At the end of season one, I moved into my own apartment. And I loved it. I’d already been fairly self-sufficient for a while, so once I got all the Pop-Tarts out of my system, I was cooking pretty regularly. And I went back to Reno to see my mom whenever I could.” The sound of my keyboard continues to fill the space between us. “I’d love to hear more about your family,” I say tentatively, because I haven’t forgotten what he said about his dad, and the fact that he doesn’t mention going back to see him. Another few taps of his pen along the table. “Let’s see . . . you already know they got divorced when I was in high school. My mom used to do hospital billing, but now she’s a rabbi.” I gasp. “Are you serious? That’s amazing. We can put that in the book, right? Please don’t tell her I eat pork.” “She wouldn’t judge,” he says. “And you’ll actually meet her in a few weeks. We’ll spend some time at my old house
