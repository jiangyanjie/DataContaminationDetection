surface of my skin. “How are you today, Maddie?” Her voice is very gentle, perhaps because she’s concentrating on the task at hand, but I actually stop to think about her question. The truthful answer is: not great. My back still hurts and my four nights a week aren’t helping; I hope I never see my dad hallucinate again; I don’t want to work another day for my boss; my mum’s returning from Ghana soon; I’m still crying at night and that might be the only thing that puts me to sleep. However, I can’t say any of this because sometimes asking how someone is serves solely as a passing pleasantry and the only acceptable answer is some variation of “Fine, thanks. You?” But maybe—what if she really does want to know how I am? “Well, I’m—” “I’m just going to press a little harder,” Dr. Rana says. I blink and nod. “Yes, okay. Thank you.” Probably for the best. “Well, there’s nothing that gives me cause for concern, which is good,” Dr. Rana says, returning to her desk. “You say you hurt your back lifting heavy boxes at work?” I lift my head and lie, “Yes.” “But it says on your file you’re a personal assistant.” “Oh, erm, I was just helping the stage crew out.

I’m here because staff often get complimentary tickets and Katherine wants us all to attend when we can so we’re always up to date with CGT’s plays. Since we’re given the time and date, I can rarely make it because performances don’t always land on Dawoud’s nights. I try to focus on reading the play’s outline, but I’m still thinking about my afternoon—Katherine’s meltdown and how I really don’t want to return to work tomorrow, and Dr. Rana. (What if you had said more? Why did you lie about how you injured yourself?) Sitting alone in a foyer swarming with people waiting to enter the theater doesn’t help. With my Tuesday dress still in the wash, I’m reasonably dressed in gray pinstripe trousers, a white jumper, and a large cardigan, but to give you a sense of the remaining audience, CGT is located within walking proximity of a coffee shop brazenly charging six pounds for a small latte and a restaurant masquerading as a pub called Gentri-Pied. So patrons and audience members—primarily of a certain age and demographic—tend to dress in suits, ties, dresses, and heels. To explain away my lack of the aforementioned dress code, I keep my work lanyard around my neck. I’m glad to find my seat just
