my mother’s ashes before then.” “Then you should do so, now. But take your boy with you,” Keegan said. Iris asked Roman and Attie to accompany her to the golden field. A slight breeze stirred, blowing from the east. Iris closed her eyes. Not so long ago, she had arrived at this place, full of grief and guilt and fear. And while those things still dwelled in her, they were not as sharp as they had been. I hope you see me, Mum. I hope you’re proud of me. She opened the lid and overturned the jar. She watched as her mother’s ashes were carried by the wind, into the golden dance of the grass. “Do either of you know how to drive a lorry?” Keegan asked half an hour later. Iris and Attie exchanged a dubious look. They had just finished carrying a table from Peter’s house out into the street. “No,” Iris said, wiping sweat from her brow. “All right, well, come on then. I’m going to teach you both.” Iris glanced over her shoulder at the B and B, where Marisol was still cooking in the kitchen. Roman had been assigned to help her, and Iris was grateful, knowing Marisol had him peeling potatoes at the kitchen table. He probably was stewing about it, but he needed to rest his leg. Iris followed Attie and Keegan around the barricades to the eastern edge of the town, where lorry after lorry was parked.

Put your foot on that pedal. Push it in.” Iris watched as Attie heeded Keegan’s instructions. Soon they were bouncing along the road, Avalon Bluff nothing more than a cloud of dust behind them. First, second, third gear. Attie was able to shift seamlessly between them, and when they were traveling so fast that Iris’s teeth were rattling, Attie let out a triumphant whoop. “Very good. Now gear back down to neutral and park it,” Keegan said. Attie did so, and then it was Iris’s turn. Her palms were damp as she took the steering wheel. Her foot could barely reach the gas pedal, let alone the clutch she had to push to the floorboard. It was … disastrous. She nearly ran the lorry off the
