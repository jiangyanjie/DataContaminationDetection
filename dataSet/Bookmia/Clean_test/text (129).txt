They came together again; Bastian slipped a hand around her waist, and she did the same as they circled each other, a movement that would’ve looked predatory without the softness dancing brought it. “That dress suits you,” Bastian said, not trying to hide the turn of his eyes up and down her form. “I didn’t get a very good look at you during the Consecration—or yesterday morning in the gardens, occupied as I was—but I thought it might.” So he did recognize her from the gardens. Lore gave him a selfdeprecating smile. “That was you? How embarrassing. My belongings didn’t arrive on time, so I had to borrow a dress from the Church’s donations.” Hands left waists, came to face height and hovered within an inch of each other, palms flat as Lore orbited around him. “How fortunate,” Bastian murmured, “to have such a close contact in the Church.” The dance ended. Around them, other couples were in a pose with their right hands together and the other curved above their heads, but Bastian and Lore still stood with their palms facing between them, almost touching but not quite. “I look forward to having you around, Lore.” His voice was low, breath brushing her temple as he leaned forward to speak into her ear. “It certainly has the potential to be interesting.” “Do you think so, Your Highness?” He was close enough that she felt the brush of his lips curving. “I know so.” Across the room, Alie watched them, giggling behind her hand. Next to her, Gabe caught Lore’s eye, arched a sardonic brow. She tried to make a face that communicated what else am I supposed to do? but mostly just succeeded in looking nauseous. Bastian stepped back. He reached into his coat, and for a wild moment, Lore thought he was going to pull out a dagger or one of those tiny pistols, prove himself the Kirythean informant his father thought he was by taking care of her right here in the middle of his own party. The courtiers would probably love it. They’d all bring in peasants to murder at their own balls; it’d be the next big trend in masquerade hosting. But all Bastian pulled from his coat was a pressed flower, a line of palepurple blooms on a green stem. “A foxglove for a foxglove.” Bastian handed it to her with a bow and a flourish. “Beautiful and poisonous. Much like yourself, if I may be so bold as to make an assessment after our brief acquaintance.” Gingerly, Lore took the bloom. The dry petals crunched slightly between her fingers. “Until next time, Lore.” Bastian turned and walked away, a drop of ink in a sea of color. Lore closed the door to the apartments behind her and leaned back against it. “I suppose that went about as well as it could.” “You performed your assignment admirably,” Gabriel said, sitting down on the couch with a long sigh. “It seems ingratiating myself with Bastian won’t be the hard part.” Lore pulled off her mask and let
