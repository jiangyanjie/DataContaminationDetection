to free herself, but she’s small in stature and weak from all she’s been through. From outside the room come cries of distress—the shrill tones from the eunuchs easily distinguishable from those of the midwives and wet nurses. Meiling’s legs give out, and she sags in the guards’ arms. The burlier of the two men motions to me and Miss Zhao. “You’re coming too.” I can barely breathe, my fear is so great. Miss Zhao and I support each other as we’re herded outside to two waiting palanquins instead of the usual carriage. Lin Ta stands with his hands hidden in his sleeves, his eyes averted. Meiling is pushed into the first palanquin. I’m about to follow her when one of the guards grabs my arm and holds me back. I don’t dare try to shake myself loose, but I won’t be separated from Meiling. “Lin Ta,” I say with a deep bow. “Please…” He releases a hand from his sleeve and wordlessly waves away the guard. Before he can change his mind, I climb in next to Meiling, who’s slumped against a corner of the palanquin. My body pulses, alive with an energy I’ve never experienced before, but Meiling is barely conscious. By now I’m quite familiar with the journey that leads to the Great Within. This time we go in a different direction. “Where are they taking us?” Meiling’s voice is as insubstantial as a blossom left on a stone under the summer sun. I shake my head. The ride is extremely rough, with bumps and lurches, as if the bearers have intended to add to our suffering. When the palanquin lands with a hard thump, Meiling is nearly thrown from the seat. The door swings open, and a pair of hands reaches in and yanks her out. When I exit, I see we’re in a courtyard before the entrance to a hall unknown to me. Miss Zhao descends from her palanquin and joins me as we follow the guards dragging Meiling. The back of her sleeping gown is blotted with fresh blood. She’s too feeble to walk on her own, and the bare tops of her feet drag along the paving stones with her soles facing skyward. None of the men even bothers to glimpse at this profound nakedness, which tells me just how grave the situation is. We enter the hall. Men in formal robes stand lined against the walls. In front of us on a raised platform are two thrones, one of which is occupied. The emperor… Miss Zhao and I are pushed forward. When the man holding my shoulder lets go, I drop to the ground—Miss Zhao beside me—in total submission. “I have striven to make the palace a place of good thought and proper acts.” The emperor’s voice is not at all what I might have imagined, if I’d ever given a moment’s thought to it. He sounds like a regular man—like my husband or my grandfather—only the words he forms with his ordinary voice make my body shiver. “I have but one wife. Empress
