asking him to, HARP. Keep your mouth shut before I shut it for you. Victor. Step. Forward.” Vic did, even as Hap protested. He stopped in front of the Doorman, who squinted at him. Vic stared straight ahead as the Doorman began to circle him. He reached out and flicked the battery on Vic’s chest. He tapped his fist against the metal tied to Vic’s arms and legs. When he reappeared in front of Vic, he stood on his tiptoes, his face inches from Vic’s own. “Giovanni Lawson,” he said mildly. Vic nodded. “Yes.” “I see. And that makes you…” Vic closed his eyes. “Yes.” “So, it worked then. Foolish man. Foolish, wonderful man.” Vic’s eyes snapped open. The Doorman shook his head. “He’s not here.” “We know,” Nurse Ratched said. “He was taken by the Authority.” “They flew a whale,” Rambo added. “The Terrible Dogfish,” the Doorman said, and for the first time, he looked troubled. Then, almost to himself, “After all this time, they finally found him. They’ll—” He looked back up at Vic. “You think the Blue Fairy can help you.” “I don’t know,” Vic admitted. “But Dad said they helped him once before, and I don’t know where else to go.” “Tell me, Victor Lawson,” the Doorman said. “What are you willing to do to get him back?” And Vic said, “Anything.

I’d hate to see that happen to you, Victor Lawson.” He turned back around and disappeared into the darkness. Vic started forward, stopping when Hap didn’t move. He looked back. “What?” Hap looked up at the pyramid. “No m-matter what, we s-stay together. Don’t allow them t-to separate us.” “Agreed,” Nurse Ratched said. “We are stronger together than we are apart.” “Go team!” Rambo cried from on top of Nurse Ratched as it began to rain harder. Together, they walked into the dark and the door to Heaven slammed shut behind them. CHAPTER 21 Darkness. Vic was surrounded by it. Surrounded, that is, until the Blue Pixie appeared as if projected on the wall beside him, wings fluttering. It looked as it had on the door, eyes big, hair flowing. It spun slowly, the curve of its buttocks there and gone. Bathed in blue light, Vic saw the Doorman just ahead of them, moving with purpose, hands clasped behind his back. The Blue Pixie laughed, and though it still sounded like bells, it now had
