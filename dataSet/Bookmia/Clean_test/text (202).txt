the contessa standing to return fire with a range of purse-carry accessories. The same pepperpot gun Roddy bought comes in a thigh holster and ships with a selection of replaceable grips in non-slip pearl or abalone. There are no cash registers, so you’d think these items change hands as a courtesy, but in the middle of the room there’s a tall woman—ordinary tall, not Titan tall—in what I’m guessing is about twenty grand’s worth of ballistic spidersilk formal wear. She says her name is Celine. The accent is French with a trace of somewhere else, maybe Bangkok but maybe not. “Hi Celine, I’m Cal.” “And what can I do for you, Cal?” “Suppose you had to guess?” She nods and looks me up and down, checking for cost. Feet, wrist, neck. My shoes say I walk; I don’t wear a watch because they’re unnecessary now and I don’t wear a necklace because men who wear necklaces look like mob lawyers in TV shows. Also because they can be used to strangle you in a tussle. No easy markers of wealth, yet here I am. Tech bro, maybe. Musician. Film asshole. Or: Celine’s eyes flick to the arms of my jacket, looking for a holster. Then she walks around back, looking at the lines of my clothes. “Federal,” she says at last, “I hope.” “I’m a consultant.” She sighs. “Couldn’t decide if the suit was really good or if you just weren’t carrying.” She hits a bell and a kid comes out of the back room. He’s wearing hayseed overalls and a Henley shirt. A stitched tag on the left cuff has a mock fire service badge and the words “no-burn.” Celine tells him to mind the store. “But call me, Aaron, if anything comes up.” Aaron ducks his head, twice, and I wonder if he’s her son. Mick’s is a family business, but in keeping with its executive spy vibe it’s hard to find out what family. Though probably not hard enough that it’s actually interesting. We head into the back office, plush leather and fitting rooms for the bespoke set, and on through into the warehouse space behind, where the real work gets done and the lacquer gives way to chipboard and bare concrete. Way in the back someone’s cutting fabric with hydraulic diamond shears. Celine pulls two old office chairs up to the same side of a trestle table and we sit. There’s a working tablet propped up on two old coffee cans, sleek lines buried in shock-absorbent foam so you can drop it and keep working. The foam looks cheap and homemade, but I figure it’s offcuts from something halfway nuke-proof. “I really look like a Fed?” She shrugs. “If you were a Fed you might actually be here to buy. What do you want, Mr…. ?” “Cal,” I remind her. “Sounder.” “You mind if I call you Cal?” “If I can call you Celine.” “You’ll have to. I haven’t told you my other name.” Someone brings a jug of cold water and two cups, and she pours one
