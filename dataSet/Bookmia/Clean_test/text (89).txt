understand. We need drastic action.” “You know what happened last time we drew too much attention to this place,” the short man says. “Some kid tried to re-create the ritual and failed miserably. The backlash almost ended our Order. It is the reason we find ourselves in the predicament we are in today. The Grand Owl will not allow something like that to happen again. He will keep this quiet, and he will not take any unnecessary chances.” “He’ll have to find a way to get this land back under his control.” “A mistake we also have that kid to thank for,” grumbles the gray-haired man. “Jesus. Our Order on the brink, the land and the power it holds that has always been ours, all lost because an outsider wanted what we had.” He huffs. “I’d kill him if I could.” “It’s been more than fifty years,” says Alex. “He’s an old man now.” “Still,” the gray-haired man says. “I’d still like to do it.” They both nod, and I stare down at Bezi, who is listening with her hand pressed against her mouth. I crouch and press my mouth to her ear. “They know who killed all those people back in ’71.” Bezi nods her head, and I turn to peer back inside.

The men behind us also stop, raising their gaze to the surrounding woods. “What the hell is that?” the gray-haired man asks. Agonized screams ring through the camp. They echo in the dark, and it takes me a moment to realize Kyle must have cued up the sound effects. The hidden speakers cycle through screams and menacing footsteps. The sounds seem to be coming from every direction. Bezi takes my hand and pulls me toward the showers, and we’re mounting the front steps before the men give chase again. We slam the door shut and wedge a trash can under the handle. With a loud bang, the men collide with the door. The can scrapes across the ground, and the gray-haired man slips his arm through the crack in the door and attempts to move it. I reach in my pocket and pull out the half-empty can of bear spray. I angle it toward the opening in the door and empty the canister directly into the faces of the two men. They immediately start
