was mainly concerned with my own condition, but I remember how familiar their conversation was. Miss Chen said to the doctor, ‘You know me. Have you helped me become full with child?’ ” “That could mean anything. Maybe he gave her a formula—” “Maybe, but there’s something else, and I suspect it’s related.” I hesitate, nervous to voice what I’ve come to believe. I take a breath and let the words rush out. “The night Miss Chen had her baby, Spinster Aunt came to see me. I could tell she was upset, but she wouldn’t say what was wrong.” “So?” “Even back then, I thought she saw or heard something when Miss Chen was in labor. Maybe Spinster Aunt was killed to keep her from telling me, from telling anyone.” Meiling gives me a doubtful look. “Her death was an accident.” “But what if it wasn’t?” Before she can ask, I volunteer, “No, I don’t have proof she was murdered. But something happened in the labor room that disturbed Spinster Aunt enough that she wouldn’t confide in me. I think it also caused her to enter the courtyard at night alone, which is not something she would have ordinarily done. Perhaps she went to meet someone.” I pause. Again, I worry I’m going too fast. “There’s a witness to what happened during Manzi’s birth.” Meiling nods slowly as understanding comes to her. “My mother was in the room to catch Miss Chen’s baby.” She stands. “Wait here. I’ll get her.” A few minutes later, Meiling and her mother return. I don’t know what Meiling told her, but the midwife regards me warily. I take her measure too. After all these years, Midwife Shi finally looks like a granny. She’s rounder, and gray threads through her hair. It takes much prodding and cajoling, but eventually Midwife Shi confesses what she knows. When she’s done, we sit in silence for several minutes. Finally, Meiling takes a breath. “If all this is true—” “It is,” her mother says. “Then why didn’t Doctor Wong try to end Yunxian’s second and third pregnancies?” “Daughter, you’re a midwife. You know the answer. Many children don’t live to seven years. What need of a plan for the future could there be until Manzi reached that age? Better yet, until he was eight years old?” “By that time,” I cut in, “I had three daughters. They offered no threat. And who knows? What may have started out as an unlikely seed of an idea took years to grow. Maybe Doctor Wong thought fate would intervene and bring me a son the fourth time I was full with child. In the end, you were the victim.” Several emotions wash over Meiling’s features as she considers all this. At last, she asks, her voice tremulous, “What should we do?” “If we act,” I answer, “there could be repercussions for my husband’s family. And for the two of you.” “I’m afraid,” my friend admits, “but can we in good conscience do nothing?” Midwife Shi and I remain silent as Meiling rises. She crosses
