said Bunny, reaching for Marion’s suitcase and lugging it up the steps. Marion followed, unsure of what exactly was going on. The door led to a large parlor where a group of girls around their age were chatting loudly, seated on couches and chairs that looked like they’d been there since the last century. Posters from Broadway shows hung on the walls, along with photos of famous stage actresses, including Ellen Terry and Sarah Bernhardt. The clatter of dishes drifted up from a lower floor. “Where are we?” asked Marion. “The Rehearsal Club. A boardinghouse for girls in the performing arts.” “This is where you live?” “Sure thing. Me and four other Rockettes. Mrs. Fleming, who runs the place, loves us because we get a steady paycheck and never fall behind on rent. The other girls are actress and singer wannabes, with a couple of comedians and opera singers thrown into the mix, but we try not to hold it against them. Comes with room and board.” To live right in the middle of New York, within walking distance of the theater, was a dream. “How much?” “Eighteen dollars a week. Leaves you with more than enough extra for fun. Speaking of fun, I’m going out with my beau tonight, along with a friend of his. You can join us, and we’ll celebrate your new home.” Marion looked about. Living in a boardinghouse with actresses? Her father would have a heart attack. On the train into the city, she’d imagined finding a room at the top of a brownstone owned by an elderly lady with a cat or two. But she didn’t know how to even begin to find accommodations like that. Her life had been so sheltered, she was ashamed to admit. “I’m not sure.” “Not sure about what, the Club or dinner tonight?” “Maybe both?” Bunny looked at her like she was crazy. “Let’s go find Mrs. Fleming; she’ll give you all the details, and then you can decide, all right?” Mrs. Fleming’s office was located at the back of the building, a small room that held a desk, several metal filing cabinets, and an overstuffed brown couch that overwhelmed the space. A gray-haired woman in a simple gray dress sat behind the desk, but when she looked up and smiled, her face flooded with warmth. “What can I do for you, dear?” she asked Bunny. “Mrs. Fleming, my friend Marion here is a new Rockette and needs a place to stay. There’s an extra bed in my room, I’d be happy to share with her.” “Why don’t you have a seat?” said Mrs. Fleming to Marion, gesturing to the sofa. “I’ve got to get back to Radio City,” said Bunny. “Meet me at the stage door at ten and we’ll grab dinner.” Bunny blew Marion a kiss and disappeared. After she was gone, Mrs. Fleming picked up a clipboard and a pen. “Congratulations on becoming a Rockette. Now, what’s your full name?” “Marion Brooks.” “Is that your stage name or your real name?” “Real name.” “Lucky you. I’ve heard
