financial aid letters arrived on the same afternoon, and I opened the envelopes with shaking hands to learn that I’d been offered what amounted to a free freshman year at three schools. I had to count the zeros several times before I could believe it. “You did it,” my mother said. She tried to smile, but we both wound up crying instead. As we celebrated, I wasn’t thinking about how lonely I might feel, or how much I would miss my family. I couldn’t comprehend what it would mean to attain that first foothold in a world they would be unable to follow me into. I didn’t know that I would spend my early months on campus feeling as though I’d wandered into another country, surrounded by students who never had to worry about buying books or finding somewhere to go when the dorms closed for a holiday. When I was informed that the terms of my scholarship required me to send regular letters to rich donors, Daddy-Long-Legs-style, and attend luncheons where scholarship recipients would meet and express gratitude to our benefactors face-to-face, I didn’t blink. As an adoptee, I had long known what it was to be considered lucky, and to be expected to be thankful for it. Years later, when I described some of these rituals to a friend who also owed her education to need-based financial aid, she said dryly, “Tell me that you’re a poor first-generation college student without telling me that you’re a poor first-generation college student.” I laughed, but my instinct was to tell her that I hadn’t been poor—it wasn’t a term I associated with my family, nor one my parents had ever used. If we were poor, wouldn’t I have struggled more? If we were poor, wouldn’t I have known? Not long after, I found my first Free Application for Federal Student Aid, carefully filled out by my mother. At seventeen, I wouldn’t have paid much attention to our annual household income, or the fact that it amounted to considerably less than what my freshman year would cost. All I would have focused on was that our expected family contribution was zero. Although many people identify as middle-of-the-road, middle-class, average Americans, there are differences between a working-class and a middle-class existence, and these differences can be far from subtle. If you grow up as I did and happen to be very fortunate, as I was, your family might sacrifice much so that you can go to college. You’ll feel grateful for every subsequent opportunity you get, for the degrees and open doors and better-paying jobs (if you can find them), even as an unexpected, sometimes painful distance yawns between you and the place you came from—and many will expect you to express that gratitude, using your story or your accomplishments to attack those who weren’t so lucky. But in this country, unless you attain extraordinary wealth, you will likely be unable to help your loved ones in all the ways you’d hoped. You will learn to live with the specific, hollow guilt of those
