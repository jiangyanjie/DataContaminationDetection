“Yes. It was the same man who was in Radio City right before the bomb went off.” Ogden pointed to the ghost light on the stage. “That doesn’t give off much light. How can you be sure? How do we know it wasn’t some crazed Rockette fan?” “Because I know. I saw him.” Peter stood tall. “What’s with all the resistance? Here you have someone who’s seen the bomber not once, but twice, and who was nearly—” He stopped, catching himself. “Who he went after, and you’re still pushing back?” Marion knew why. Peter had humiliated Ogden and Somers by being right about the fact that they had the wrong guy in custody. On top of that, she’d brought them the letter from the imitator, which had sent them off on the wild-goose chase, even though she and Peter had warned otherwise. Ogden didn’t like being upstaged. Ogden moved back into the hallway, but Marion and Peter stayed on his tail. He wasn’t going to get out of this so easily. “What about Hardenby?” asked Marion. “Is he still in jail?” Ogden shook his head. “No. We couldn’t hold him after the latest bomb went off. It’ll be in the news tomorrow, I’m sure. The press will go wild with this.” “So he gets to walk away?” “He’ll be charged with making a criminal threat, but not with setting the bombs. Apparently, he hates Met Power as much as the Big Apple Bomber does and decided to join in on the fun. He sent it to you because he’d seen the Rockettes when he was a kid, heard about your connection to the Radio City bombing in the papers and all, and figured you’d be an easy target. We don’t think he’s a further threat to you.” Marion looked over at Peter. “What do you think?” “I think he’s a bomber wannabe and was probably shocked at being tossed in jail. I don’t see him as a threat.” “Well, I’m glad you cleared that up, Doctor,” said Ogden, not bothering to hide the sarcasm in his voice. The dark energy that had been coursing through Marion’s body since the attack surged again. “If you’d been out hunting for the right guy maybe this wouldn’t have happened. You might have had him by now. Do you even care one bit that I was almost killed tonight? That my sister was killed, due to your incompetence? F.P. has been around for sixteen years now.” She pointed a finger right in Ogden’s face. “How many more people have to get killed or injured before you get your act together and do your job?” “What’s going on here?” Captain Somers strode toward them. Marion stepped back, breathing heavily. Peter answered for her. “We were expressing our concern about the way this case is being handled. The bomber went after Marion tonight, and meanwhile your man Ogden here doesn’t seem to understand the seriousness of the situation.” Somers glared at Ogden. “That’s enough. Go back to headquarters.” Once Ogden had slunk away, Somers placed a hand on
