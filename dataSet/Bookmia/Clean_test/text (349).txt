word comes out frayed and uneven. “Are there children? Any girls?” The two men exchange glances. I’m not sure what this means. Maybe no one’s been counting… Maybe there are too many to count… My next question is the most important because the answer will tell me what has already happened and what is still to come. “How long has the pestilence been in residence?” “The first cases appeared two weeks ago,” one of the men answers, which means the worst effects of the disease have arrived. I try to slow my racing heart. “Is my husband here?” “Young Master Yang is in Nanjing.” Relief. He’s safe, but then I’m drawn back into the frightening reality. I’m not brave enough… I’m not knowledgeable enough… I put three fingers over my lips. Tap, tap, tap. The motion is calming, while at the same time the pattern echoes the calculations I’m making—like moving the pieces on an abacus to arrive at a solution. I must protect my son… I must find my daughters… Tap, tap, tap. I turn to Poppy. She is white with fear. I try to reassure her. “You have nothing to worry about. You already survived smallpox, as did I.” She slowly nods, but I’m not sure she believes me. “Follow me.” I hurry to my chambers. Once inside, I give the baby to Poppy, who mutely stares at me. “Keep him here,” I tell her. “Do not leave for any reason, and do not let anyone in.” I exit the room, pull the door closed, and wait until I hear Poppy clamp the lock into place. I stay alert, placing each foot carefully in front of the last, not wanting to fall in my haste. When I reach my daughters’ room, I try the handle. The door is locked, which I take to be a good sign. I knock and call to my eldest daughter in a low voice, “Yuelan.” I hear movement inside. Then close, so close, just on the other side of the door, Yuelan says, “Mama.” “Are you well?” “Chunlan and I are fine, but Ailan…” Yuelan starts to cry. “We put her outside when the fever came. Someone took her to the garden.” With that, as filled with doubts as I am, I know what I must do. First, though, I try to bolster my daughters’ spirits for whatever might come next. “You did everything correctly,” I say. “I’m proud to have you as my children. Don’t ever forget that.” The wrenching sounds of my two oldest girls weeping follows me down the corridor back to my bedchamber. Poppy unbolts the door and lets me in. I hurriedly scan my shelves, putting whatever herbs I think will be useful into satchels. When I tell her what I’m going to do, she starts to cry big, gulping sobs. I’m working hard to tamp down my own fear and have neither the time nor the will to comfort her. Poppy puts my satchels in the corridor, I take Lian in my arms, and together we go to my
