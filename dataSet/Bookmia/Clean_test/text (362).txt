there to curse at him, to insist he keep his eyes open, to hold his hand and ensure he was all right. She swallowed, her mouth dry and full of ash. She blinked away her tears. It was just smoke in her eyes. Smoke in her eyes, burning her up from within. “I think we can retrieve one more,” Stanley said. “As long as there’s gunfire, we have time. Can you do that?” Iris nodded, listening to the pop of the guns in the distance. But her shoulders were sore, her breaths were uneven. Her heart pounded a painful song in her chest as she ran behind Stanley, the stretcher banging against her sore thighs. They went deeper into the trenches this time. Iris’s legs were trembling as she realized the gunfire was beginning to ease. Did that mean Dacre’s soldiers had killed everyone at the front? Did that mean they would soon press closer? Would they kill her if they found her, stranded in the thick of the trenches? Did they take prisoners? Before Dacre takes them. The captain’s words echoed through her, making her shiver. Distracted, Iris tripped over something. It brought her to her knees, and she felt stray pieces of shrapnel bite into her skin. Stanley paused, glancing over his shoulder to look at her. “Get up,” he said, and he suddenly sounded afraid, because the gunfire was waning. But Iris was scarcely listening to him, or the way the world was becoming eerily silent again. Because there on the ground was a leather bag that looked just like the one she was carrying.

Iris nodded and stumbled through the dusky light to the back of the lorry. Soldiers were being loaded, and she waited, not wanting to push her way through. Eventually, one of the privates saw her and hefted her up into the crowded bed without a word. She sprawled on top of someone groaning in pain. Iris shifted her weight, unbalanced by the two bags on her back. “Oh, I’m so sorry!” “Miss Winnow?” She studied the bloodied soldier beneath her. “Lieutenant Lark? Oh my gods, are you all right?” It was a ridiculous thing for her to ask. Of course, he wasn’t all right— none of them were all right—but she suddenly didn’t know what to do, what to say. She gently moved to sit beside him,
