firmly closed door. Even before she spoke, I understood that my question was an intrusion on her hard-won peace, a knock she wasn’t ready to answer. “I don’t need to talk about having cancer, Nicole,” she told me. “I lived through it.” She did live through it. The breast cancer never returned. But her illness, the first serious one of her life, was a turning point for our family, an upheaval from which there would be no lasting recovery. * * * Once, while visiting my parents, I asked my father what he was proudest of in life. “You,” he said. I’d walked right into that one. “Besides me.” When he paused, I wondered if he would say something sarcastic, or tell me that he couldn’t think of anything. But the answer he gave was confident, his face as serious as I’d ever seen it. “I’m pretty proud,” he said, “of getting out of Ohio.” Dad was thirteen years old when he was told that his mother’s kidneys were failing. The first successful living kidney transplant had been performed a decade earlier, in 1954, but the procedure was risky and far from common. Hemodialysis treatment for patients with acute renal failure had recently become available, and a home dialysis machine was soon installed in his mother’s bedroom. His parents enjoyed entertaining, and their home in Euclid had been a gathering place for parties and family holiday celebrations. Now the household settled into a state of hushed anxiety. Their father’s habitual jokes, usually made at someone else’s expense, took on a hard, cutting edge. Dad, his brother, and his three sisters all quickly learned what was expected of them: They couldn’t play or roughhouse after school. They couldn’t invite friends over. The first hint of an argument would land all of them in trouble. What the hell’s the matter with you?

His grades were never stellar—my mother used to wonder whether he had undiagnosed dyslexia—but he was a hard worker, adept at solving technical problems. He also found it easy to talk with people and make them laugh; his sense of humor, unlike his father’s, was warm and rarely bitter. He won graphic arts and lithography awards for his work in his high school print shop, and by his senior year he’d secured a part-time training-with-pay job in the city printing department, where he spent fifteen hours a week generating interdepartmental memos, civic work orders, and official town correspondence for $1.49 an hour. He wasn’t sure that college was for him, and was glad to learn a trade that might lead to a good career without a bachelor’s degree. No business could be conducted without reams of paper, he thought—every company, every school, every town would always need printers. His printing experience led him to a good entry-level job with American Greetings after he graduated from high school. He took a couple of
