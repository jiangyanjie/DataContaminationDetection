I started crying a while ago. I hate that people might be looking at me but the thought doesn’t stop the tears from spilling. A thumb begins stroking the back of my hand before I hear his chair pull from the table. When I look up, Sam and our food are gone. I sit, trying to wipe my face as best as I can when he returns with paper bags. “The leftovers taste even better in the morning.” He hands me one of the bags and takes my other hand—it’s warm and swallows mine. “Come with me, Maddie.” We step out into the warm evening and silently Sam walks me down a straight road. He still holds my hand, his fingers slotted in between mine. I don’t know a lot about him but I feel as if I could close my eyes, sink into his warmth, and still arrive wherever we’re going intact. We walk for ten minutes before we make a right and enter an ice-cream shop. He sits me at a table and goes to the counter, where there are rows and rows of ice-cream containers. It’s bright in here and the shop’s name, MOOPHORIA, is in neon lights behind the counter. When Sam returns, he places a cup of ice cream in front of me. “Thank you.” I take a spoonful and the sugar makes my eye twitch. “This is very sweet.” “They make it like that on purpose,” Sam says. “It’s good for shock.” I look at him, knowing I wouldn’t blame him for cutting this date short. “Thank you, again. Sincerely.” “You’re welcome.” “Why is yours green?” I ask. “It’s mint.” “Eugh.” “You don’t like mint chocolate ice cream?” he asks incredulously. “Do you like eating chocolate after you’ve brushed your teeth?” “Not the same thing.” He offers me his spoon. “Here, try some.” I taste his and, “Okay, it’s not the same.” “See?” “But it’s not far off.” He smiles but puts his spoon down. “Want to talk about what just happened?” I clear my throat and shift in my seat. “I don’t know if I have anything else to add.” “Then I’ll just answer your question.” Sam leans across the table. “You are.” “What question?” “When are you going to be fine again?” Sam clarifies. “And I’m saying, you are fine. This is your new fine, Maddie.” I consider this. “That’s depressing.” He laughs without joy. “I know it sounds it. But you’re not supposed to ‘get over’ someone dying,” he says, “especially someone you loved, and your feelings of guilt may not be justified, but they are natural. Thing is, you don’t ever go back, Maddie, to life before, and my advice is to accept that. To accept that you’re not the same person you were when your dad was alive and you can’t be again. Accept that your life is different now because of this monumental, irreversible change and that it’s okay to feel guilty one day and indescribable happiness another. This is life now,” he says. “This is how you live.” He
