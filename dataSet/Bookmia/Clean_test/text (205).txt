sight. “A lot?” “Going from running away from me to sleeping in the same bed, in under one hour.” I flush and look at my toes. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to run—I just . . . And I’m not, like, coming on to you.” I’d love to sound sharp and indignant, but it’s just not where I’m at. “We’ve established that you don’t need to come on to me, Elsie. Do you want something to sleep in?” “Oh.” I shake my head. “I’m good. I’m wearing leggings, anyway. I figured that if I had to suffer through 2001, I could at least be comfy.” “I thought you loved the movie.” I give him an appalled look. Jack leans against the dresser, arms crossed. “It’s what your friend said,” he explains. “Oh, no. I mean, she thinks I do. She thinks I’m into artsy movies, but I don’t really . . .” Tell her the truth. I think Jack can read my mind. “Does she know how much you like Twilight?” he asks with a small, kind smile. “No way.” I laugh weakly. “If anything, she might suspect I enjoy it ironically.” “Ironically?” “Yeah. You know, when you like something because it’s bad and love making fun of it?” He nods. “Is that why you enjoy Twilight?” “I don’t know.” I sit on the edge of the mattress, gripping the soft comforter. “I don’t believe so, no.” I ponder. “I like simple, straightforward romance stories with dramatic characters and improbably high stakes,” I add, surprising myself a little. I didn’t know this before putting it into words, and I feel like Jack has beaten me to some part of myself. Again. “Also, I like to imagine Alice and Bella ending up together after the movie is over.” “I see.” As ever, he files away. Then he pulls something that looks like sweats and a tee from under his pillow and heads for the door. “If you change your mind or get cold, just look around. You’ll find something to wear.” “Are you giving me permission to rummage around your bedroom? Like you have nothing to hide?” He lifts one eyebrow. “What would I hide?” “I don’t know.” I shrug. “A giant tentacle dildo. Viagra. A diary with a pink locket.” “None of that would be worth hiding,” he says, the most quietly confident man in the entire world. “I’ll be downstairs if you need anything, okay?” The door closes with a soft click, and I’m right here. In Jack Smith-Turner’s bedroom. Alone with his pillows and his CERN wall art and probably the desiccated livers of twelve theorists. Plus, a whole lot of falling snow. I quickly update Cece on the shit show that’s my life, then slide under the covers on what I hope isn’t Jack’s side, groaning in pleasure. I have a really firm mattress. Great for spinal health. He sure does, and it’s perfect. I immediately relax, enveloped by the comforter and a nice, dark scent that I’m not ready to admit is Jack’s. I could stay here forever.
