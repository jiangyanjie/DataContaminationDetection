“Let me put some ointment on you,” I said. “I’m really okay.” “That roof,” I said, giving him a trust me look, “is super filthy. Birds poop on it all the time. Not to mention acid rain, nuclear waste—” “Nuclear waste?” “The point is, you don’t want an infection.” Joe considered that, and then nodded and sat backward on one of the kitchen chairs. I pulled up a chair behind him and used a Q-tip to dab him with ointment. The scratches weren’t deep, but they covered a lot of territory. With any luck, we’d be here a while. He had a bright pink scar on his shoulder that looked like he’d gotten stitches. “Where’d you get the scar?” I asked. “It looks pretty recent.” “I crashed into a lamppost,” Joe said, not seeming too interested. He crashed into a lamppost? Was that the drinking-and-carousing lifestyle he lived? So many red flags with this guy. But I must have been much more lonesome than I realized. Here was a man who I didn’t even like—but the nearness of his naked torso was putting me into some kind of a trance. What was going on with me? I was dabbing at the scrapes, but I kept losing my concentration and dabbing the wrong spots. My eyes kept wandering away from the task, traveling up his spine, out along his shoulder, down his arms. His skin was kind of buttery-tan, and he had freckles on his shoulders, like he’d worked outside a lot with that shirt off. I pictured him raking leaves shirtless. And washing the car shirtless. Maybe tending to a vegetable garden shirtless? Then harvesting the vegetables and bringing them inside to make a shirtless meal from scratch? Hey! I could suddenly hear my own voice saying inside my head. Pull it together! Stop fantasizing about the Weasel! But the acoustics in my head weren’t great. The voice sounded tinny and echoey like I was at the bottom of a well. Whereas Joe’s voice—and everything else about him—was coming in loud and clear. Honestly, Dr. Nicole would be very proud of me right now. “You know what I love about this moment?” Joe asked then, sounding sleepy as he rested his head on his arms. I leaned forward to take a guess. “The fact that I feel genuinely sorry about doing this to you, even though it was entirely your fault?” “I definitely like that. But I’m talking about something I love.” By accident, right then, I caught the way his plump bottom lip pressed against his teeth when he made the V in the word love. “What do you love?” I asked, now suddenly aware of my own lip doing the same thing. He glanced back with a vibe that felt positively affectionate. Then he said, “You’ve still got your roller skates on.” Thirteen THE NEXT NIGHT was Friday. The night of my synchronized caffeination event with Dr. Addison. Also known as my first date with my future husband. He wasn’t calling it a date. And neither was I—out loud. But
