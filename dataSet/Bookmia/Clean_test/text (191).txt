up and down, but Bastian paid no mind to their warnings. His eyes stayed locked on Lore’s as he reached up, slowly wiped blood from his split lip. Got you, he mouthed. Then Michal’s fist crashed into the side of Bastian’s head. The Sun Prince went down. Silence. Michal looked almost surprised, glancing first at his fist, and then into the crowd, like he was searching for whatever had so distracted his opponent. And he found it. Those familiar blue eyes widened. “Lore?” Michal’s mouth kept working, spitting questions, but they were drowned out in the roar of the crowd. The hay-bale ring broke as people rushed forward to congratulate him, and Michal was borne away by well-wishers, shock still stark on his face. Next to her, Gabe wore nearly the same expression. “Bleeding God and Buried Goddess,” he cursed, whirling from the crowd to face Lore. “Who was—” “An old friend.” Bastian was next to them, sneaking up soundless as a cat.

CHAPTER NINETEEN A secret is a flame, and it cannot burn forever. —Auverrani proverb It only took a moment for Lore to start struggling, pulling against Bastian’s inexorable grip with curses that a duke’s cousin surely wouldn’t know. But that didn’t matter, not anymore. Michal had recognized her, and now Bastian knew who she was. What she was. Lore twisted, trying to haul herself away, but Bastian pulled her on, toward the mouth of another narrow alley as the shouts of the crowd dimmed behind them. No dagger, and she’d be no match for the Sun Prince in strength. Mortem was all she had. And though she wasn’t sure what she could do with it, in the absence of a dead body to raise, there had to be something. Lore held her breath and waited for her vision to go grayscale, for her fingers to turn necrotic and cold. But it didn’t happen. Instead there was a spark. A flash behind her eyes. The baked, heated scent of high-summer air, so close she expected a singeing. It collided with the sense of Mortem, familiar and empty, nothingness so compacted it had presence and mass. The two conflicting energies felt, for a moment, like they might tear her apart. Bastian stopped. His grip on her arm didn’t loosen, but she felt his fingers spasm. Then it was gone, so quickly it could’ve been the start of an aborted panic attack. She could still feel the Mortem surrounding them, but she couldn’t see it, couldn’t channel it. Her vision would not change to the monotone that showed her life and death; the threads would
