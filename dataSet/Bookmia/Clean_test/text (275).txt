goodbye,” he says. The best I can do in that moment is “I couldn’t.” His brows pinch. The moment holds. “Is that all?” I ask. “What?” “Did you drive all the way here to say goodbye?” I say. He scratches the back of his head, glances sidelong toward the thicket of trees at the edge of the lot, then back to me. The corners of his mouth twist, and my heart mimics the motion, wringing every last bit of love into my veins. “Why aren’t you on the plane?” he says. “It’s going in the wrong direction.” His brow tenses on a slight shake of his head. “You said I need to figure out what I want,” I say. “That I can’t keep doing what other people think is right for me.” “I meant it.” His voice rattles. “Does that include you?” I ask. “What do you mean?” he says. “I mean . . .” I move close enough to breathe him in, my shoulders melting with relief at his nearness. “Do you get to tell me what will or won’t make me happy?” His brow furrows. “I wasn’t trying to do that.” “You were,” I say. “And I get why.

But I know what I don’t want. “I don’t want to be tired all the time. I don’t want to be on opposite schedules from everyone I love, or on call during dates. I don’t want to be on my feet for eight hours at a time and have my knuckles bleed in the winter from overwashing my hands. I don’t want to feel like I don’t have time or energy to try anything new because everything I have is getting poured into a job I don’t even like. I don’t want to live my life like it’s a triathlon and all that matters is getting to some imaginary ribbon. I want my life to be like— like making pottery. I want to enjoy it while it’s happening, not just for where it might get me eventually. “And I don’t want to be across the country from you. Or your family. I don’t want to miss a single holiday with them. I don’t want to go to sleep without being able to put my feet on your calves to warm them up, and I don’t want to say goodbye to your rodeo shirt, and I don’t
