a decommissioned canoe has fallen out of its rack and is resting directly on top of the hatch. Javier lets the air hiss out from between his teeth. “That explains that,” Javier says. “We were running from a canoe. Nice.” “And the camera?” I ask. “And the lock on the boathouse? I know I locked it.” “You sure?” Kyle asks. “I forgot to lock the front gate. It’s okay if it slipped your mind.” “No,” I say adamantly. “I don’t forget to do stuff like that.” Kyle’s gaze traces down to the floor. “Sorry,” I say. “I’m not tryna make you feel bad. I’m just saying that I know I locked it.” Bezi tries to get Tasha on the phone, but she doesn’t have a signal either. “We gotta go to the office and use the landline,” I say. Javier’s brows push up. “Who is ‘we’? I’m not going anywhere.” “It’s almost six,” I say. “You’re not worried about them?” “Not really,” says Javier. “They’re probably on their way back right now.” Bezi crosses her arms over her chest. “I guess Tasha has a soft spot for insensitive jerks. Her last boyfriend was a lot like you. She dropped his sorry ass.” Javier shrugs. “Good thing I’m not her boyfriend, then, huh?” Bezi and Javier look at each other like they want to fight. “Stop,” I say to both of them. “We’re not going to argue. Not right now. I don’t have a problem going to the office myself, but Tasha has a cell phone. Things might work on my end but they probably won’t work on hers.” There aren’t any other choices, and as I weigh my options, I can see the light fading from the sky. “We gotta go get them.” “Again,” Javier says. “Who is ‘we’?” I make sure my sneakers are knotted and I pull my hair up into a puff on top of my head. “Go. Or stay. I don’t care what you do. I’m going to take a flashlight and go find them.” “I’m coming too,” Bezi says. Kyle sighs. “I guess I’m going too.” Javier glares at us. “You’re just gonna leave me here? Alone?” “Yeah,” I say without hesitation. He grumbles something I can’t make out, then tilts his head and clenches his jaw. “Fine. We’ll all go together.” Suddenly, my phone vibrates in my pocket, and I let out a little squeal as I scramble to pull it out. I breathe a sigh of relief as Tasha’s name flashes across the screen. I hit the green button and press the phone to my ear. “Tasha! Oh my god, where are you? I’ve been tryna call you, but the signal—” Static garbles the line, and Tasha’s voice breaks through in strangled yelps. “Charity! . . . out there! I can’t . . . please!” Bezi grips my arm. “Where is she? What’s happening?” A fear unlike anything I’ve ever felt in my entire three years of working at Camp Mirror Lake, or my lifetime of horror-movie watching, grips my chest like a vise, squeezing
