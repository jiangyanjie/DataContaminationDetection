Marion didn’t care that she could hear. “We’re so close. This is insane.” Together, they walked back outside. “If Martinek is set on planting another bomb tomorrow, there’s no time to waste,” said Marion. “We have to figure out another plan, try to catch him in the act.” “The two of us?” Peter looked ill. If they had the right guy, and she was certain they did, it meant that her father shared the blame in Judy’s death, for not turning over the documents to the police right away. She couldn’t bear the thought. Turning in the bomber meant turning in her father. But if they waited for the police to come to their senses and listen to what she and Peter had to say, it would give the bomber a chance to set yet another bomb and possibly kill or injure more people. “I have a plan,” said Marion finally. “I know what we should do.” * * * Marion couldn’t go back to Bronxville and look Simon in the eye, knowing what he and his fellow employees at Met Power had done. After she and Peter got back to the loft, she called the house and was relieved when Mrs. Hornsby answered. “Can you tell Dad I’ll be staying in the city one more night?” she said. “Oh, my dear, I was planning on making your favorite dish tonight, chicken and dumplings.” A muffled noise in the background pulled away her attention. “Oh, hold on, your father just walked in the door.

I’ll come myself if Nathaniel isn’t available.” “I’m not ready,” she said. Peter had moved to the other side of the loft, where a desk sat near the window, trying to give her some privacy, but he could still hear everything. “I need another night,” she said. Her father let out a disappointed sigh. “Marion. That’s not what we agreed on.” “I can’t explain why, but I have to stay.” “I’m driving to the Rehearsal Club right now, then. I’ll drag you out if I have to.” “You won’t find me there.” “Is this some kind of riddle? Please, Marion, I have to know that you’re safe. How can you do this to me?” “I think that’s a question for both of us.” “I have no idea what you’re talking about.” He paused. “Did you go to my office yesterday to collect Judy’s things? I stopped by this afternoon to catch up on some work, and Dennis said he ran into you.” “I was there, yes.” “What’s going on?” But the words didn’t have the vehemence of his earlier questions. “I have to go. I’ll be in touch when I can. I’m safe, but I can’t see you right now.” Marion hung up. With nowhere else to go, Marion stayed at Peter’s apartment again, where they solidified their plan well into
