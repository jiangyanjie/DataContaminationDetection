pushing open the door. It creaked, but if the sound woke anyone inside, they didn’t protest. Bastian and Gabe settled Milo on the floor, then left quickly, soundlessly. He didn’t stir. “You’re a sneaky lot,” Val commented once they were all outside. “Have either of you considered poison running?” Gabe looked stricken, but Bastian shrugged. “Not as such, no, but never say never. Although my current schedule wouldn’t allow for it.” “That’s a shame.” Mari shook her head. “Our crew is dwindling rapidly these days.” “Arrests?” Lore asked quietly. Val’s operation might be newly legal, but bloodcoats had been known to arrest anyone they didn’t like the look of. “If only it were that simple.” A laugh huffed from Mari’s mouth, twisting into the air like smoke. “Our most loyal are still around—everyone you’d know, mouse, don’t worry—but the newer folks keep getting lured away.” She tightened the knot on her headscarf again, lips twisting wryly. “I guess getting paid enough to cover your rent for a year with one night of work is a hard bargain to pass up.” The words registered with all three of them at the same time. Bastian’s eyes widened. Gabe’s lips went flat. Lore’s pulse thumped in her wrists. “You know about the cargo movements?” “Cargo,” Val said derisively. “It’s contraband, has to be. No one pays that amount of money to move anything legal.” “Oh, it’s absolutely not legal.” Mari snorted. “Phillip let some of the details slip when he came by to quit, and you’d think he’d signed his own execution warrant when he realized. I had to promise up and down for nearly an hour that I wouldn’t tell anyone before he’d go.” “Do you have any information about where they move it to?” Gabe sounded like he was conducting an interrogation. Lore scowled at him. He paid no mind. “Or anything about who is actually doing the hiring?” Val gave him an icy glance. “I believe Mari just said she promised a friend not to disclose anything.” The skin on Lore’s shoulders prickled. The last thing she needed was for Gabe to goad Val into a fight. She was certain Gabe would lose. Bastian apparently thought the same thing. “Of course we would never want someone to go back on a promise,” he interjected with a smile. “I apologize for my friend’s impertinence.” If looks could light someone on fire, the glance Gabe shot Bastian would’ve left him in cinders. Mari crossed her arms, thoughtfully chewed her lip. “This is information you need, though, isn’t it?” she asked Lore softly. “For whatever they’re having you do up at the Citadel. Which means it’s more than just hauling contraband.” “Yes,” Lore said. She’d never been able to lie to Mari. She saw through to the core of things, even when you tried to hide them. Her mothers’ eyes flickered toward each other. “Can you tell us anything, Lore?” Mari asked softly. She wanted to. She wanted to let all of it go—the bodies, the lies, the esoteric mysteries she knew had to fit
