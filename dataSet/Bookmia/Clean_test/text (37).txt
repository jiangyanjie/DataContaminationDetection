their lives. It has now been fourteen years since we found each other—since our correspondence began, and those first careful, hopeful letters gave way to one visit, then many more. My kids have known their aunt Cindy all their lives, but I understand how easily they might never have known her at all, and have told them the story of what we did to put part of our family back together. When I see my sister, talk with her, it feels as if we are recovering lost treasure. In her company, I’m able to be my whole self. She and her husband, Rick, had met my adoptive parents only once before. Yet when my father died, they both took time off work to make the five-hour drive from Portland, arriving just in time to help and offer my children the crucial distraction of a cousin to play with. Cindy and I cleaned my mother’s house so it would be ready for visitors. My brother-in-law ran errands, took the kids to the playground, picked up dinner for all of us. On the morning of the funeral, Dan and I had to call the girls three times before they would stop giggling with their cousin and change into their church clothes. I was worried we would be late, but it was good to see them smiling and looking like themselves again.

While she had seen movies and read books touching on death, it was not yet a solid concept to her. Dan and I had tried to explain what it meant that her grandpa was gone—that she wouldn’t see him again as she had known him, and that we were all very sad and would miss him—but these conversations felt no easier, even after several attempts. I wasn’t sure how to bridge the space between our words and her understanding of what had happened when I was still struggling to absorb it myself. When we brought our children up to the casket to see my father one last time, tears were drifting down our older daughter’s cheeks. I took her hand, then put my arm around her and drew her close, as my mother had done with me. My younger daughter reached out, hesitantly, and touched my father’s gray beard. Her fingers brushed his cold cheek. She smiled down at him, just a little smile. “Goodbye, Grandpa. We love you. We’ll miss you.” I was, and had been
