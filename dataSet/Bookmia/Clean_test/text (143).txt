to come to my chambers.” “Please stay. We would all like to hear what you have to say.” Lady Kuo sounds solicitous, but our guests are not fooled. “Your room sounds lovely,” the widow says. “Let us retire there.” We walk slowly through the covered colonnades, stopping here and there so the visitors can enjoy the scent of jasmine and admire the plumes of a caged bird, while Poppy runs ahead to prepare. When we arrive, we settle, and Poppy pours tea. “Please tell me about your daughter,” I begin. “How old is she? What are her symptoms?” Tears well in the widow’s eyes, so Lady Liu speaks on her behalf. “My sister-in-law is thirty-five years old. When she hears people speaking, she becomes dizzy.” It’s an odd symptom, no question, but it doesn’t sound all that worrisome to me. However, we’ve reached the fifth month, when the growing heat and humidity can bring sickness and disease. “Does she have a rash?” I ask. “No cases of smallpox have been reported in Nanjing,” Lady Liu answers. Which is a relief. “You asked for me because I’m a woman,” I say. “I hope you don’t mind if I ask some intimate questions.” When both women nod, I go on. “Tell me about her stools and urine.” “She has fainted multiple times when sitting on the honeypot,” Lady Liu states. “What does her doctor say?” I inquire. “He says she’s Blood and qi deficient,” Lady Liu answers. “Now she coughs up blood.” They might have mentioned this symptom first, but hearing it, I say, “It sounds as though he’s made the correct diagnosis.” “Is she dying?” Widow Bao asks, her voice quavering. “She’s my daughter…” “I can’t do the Four Examinations from afar.” I try to sound reassuring when I add, “Tell me more. Perhaps her doctor missed something.” “Ask us anything.” “Can you describe her disposition?” “Until now, she’s always been quick-tempered and impatient,” the widow answers. “Now she stays in bed, weeping day and night.” This is another important symptom, but what is the cause? I remain silent, waiting for one of the women to tell me what brought about such sorrow. We each take sips of tea. Widow Bao’s eyes fill again; Lady Liu gives one of those sighs known through the ages to convey loss of heart. “My sister-in-law’s daughter died ten months ago,” she confides at last. “This is when she began to cry. Four months later, bandits killed her son.” Widow Bao openly weeps. When Lady Liu puts a comforting hand over her mother-in-law’s, I wish I could have a relationship like this with Lady Kuo, but she has no interest and my desires are not what matter here. “Widow Bao, I believe your daughter is suffering from a type of qi deficiency we call damage from weeping. You tell me your daughter was once quick-tempered. This is caused by qi constraint, which leads to Heat in the Liver, which, in turn, fires up Blood, which must be expelled by coughing.
