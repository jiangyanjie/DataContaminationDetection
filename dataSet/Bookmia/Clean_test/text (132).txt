the forest.” “Vic,” the Coachman said. “You already look the part of a machine, but I need you to act like one. Act like you’ve never acted before! Let’s see what you’ve got! You are a machine. You are an inspector. Show me what you’ve got. Make me believe.” Vic shifted awkwardly, the helmet sliding down on his forehead. He pushed it back up and cleared his throat. “Um. These crates contain exactly what they’re supposed to?” “Brava!” the Coachman cried. “Encore! Encore! Oh, I believed it. Yes, you will do quite well. Keep that energy. Never let anyone take it from you.” Vic blinked. “But I didn’t—” “How long will we be in the crates?” Nurse Ratched said. “Not long, not long. A few hours at most. Bernard will make sure they’ll be sent to a warehouse closed for renovations. The work is set to begin next month, so it should be empty. When you feel as if you’ve stopped moving, wait at least another hour before climbing out of the crates to be safe.” “This plan is filled with holes,” Nurse Ratched said. “The best plans often are,” the Coachman agreed. “Rambo, stop picking up rocks, you delightful fellow. You won’t have time to do anything with them and—” A horn blared from somewhere in the warehouse. The Coachman’s eyes widened. “Shift change! We need to move now.” He spun on his heels and began to march toward the warehouse. The blocky machines moved single file toward a door at the back of the warehouse that flashed green as each one went through. They didn’t speak, nor did they pay Vic and the others any mind. It was as if they weren’t aware of anything else. The warehouse itself was cavernous, the sounds of their footsteps echoing in the eerie quiet. Crates were stacked almost to the ceiling, each with a small screen that displayed a series of green numbers and letters. Nothing gave away the contents inside or what their destination would be. Bernard led them toward the side of the warehouse, his steps heavy against the cement floor. The Coachman walked next to him, keeping up a one-sided conversation about nothing in particular. Vic and Hap pretended to look at the crates as if inspecting them, though it was nothing more than a cursory glance at best. Bernard never slowed, keeping a quick pace. It was Rambo who almost got them caught. One moment, he was next to Nurse Ratched in front of Vic and Hap, and the next, he squealed and was off like a shot to their right. “Rambo,” Vic hissed, looking around to make sure they weren’t being watched. “Rambo. Get back here!” Rambo didn’t listen. He stopped in front of a machine parked between the crates against a wall. The machine was big and blue with black trim and a large circular brush at its base. “Oh dear,” the Coachman said as Bernard’s head spun toward Rambo. But Rambo didn’t pay any mind. He stopped in front of the machine. “Oh. My. Goodness. You’re
