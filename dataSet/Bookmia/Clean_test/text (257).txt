didn’t recognize. Probably a couple of VIPs who were getting a backstage tour. She hadn’t slept at all the night before, mulling over her father’s devastating revelations. Had Lucille been so bored with her life as a mother that she had been willing to leave Judy and Marion behind? Or maybe her passion for theater was so overwhelming that she was prepared to abandon the two daughters who loved her. Or even worse, perhaps Marion and Judy weren’t good enough, smart enough, or entertaining enough to make her stick around? The image of Lucille that Marion had nurtured all these years—a kind, patient, loving woman who laughed at her daughters’ antics and held them when they cried—had not been that at all. It had all been an act. Which meant all those times that Marion had come into the kitchen to find her mother staring into space, a cup of tea cooling on the table in front of her, and assumed she was content and peaceful, enjoying a quiet moment while her children played upstairs, may, in fact, have been something completely different: a bored, angry woman making plans to escape the dreary life around her.

The streets her father grew up on were dangerous; women didn’t dare venture out alone after dark. It was a different era. “What happened? Why did she leave when she did?” “When your mother came to me, she was at her wit’s end. As far as I remember, she’d been asked to take the leading role in a play. Your father wouldn’t have it, but she was determined to go anyway. She asked if I’d step up and be ready to take care of you both while she was in Boston. It was temporary, as far as I understood it.” Temporary. Was that true, or had Lucille said that as a way of making a quick escape? They’d never know. Mrs. Hornsby continued. “Your father told everyone that Lucille was visiting a sick friend and insisted I do
