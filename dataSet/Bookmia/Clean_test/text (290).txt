me!” “D-do me,” Hap said, a sneer on his lips. “D-do m-me. I n-never stop talking.” “Wow,” Rambo said. “That was scarily accurate.” “He’s learning,” Dad said, crouching down before Hap. “It’s only going to continue, and most likely at an exponential rate.” “Why?” Vic asked. Dad sighed. “Because of you, Victor.” Vic felt his stomach sink. “Hap,” Dad said. “Can you show us?” Hap looked at each of them in turn before his gaze rested on Vic, who nodded. He reached down and lifted his shirt above his head, the collar stretching. He folded it carefully before setting it on his lap. The wood on his chest and face gleamed in the cool morning light coming in through the skylights above. “This,” Dad said, pointing at the wood. “Why did you do this?” Nurse Ratched said, “The skin wouldn’t—” “Thank you, Nurse Ratched, but I would like to hear from Victor.” She fell silent. Vic popped his knuckles without thinking. “I…” He cleared his throat. “Some of the tears were too big to close. And we couldn’t grow new skin, so I had to use what I had available.” “And why not use metal?” Vic looked away. “He’s already metal. Almost all of him. Underneath. I thought it would look better if we used wood. It’d make him look more…” He struggled to find the words to describe what he meant, what he was trying to say.

I helped.” “Hap,” Dad said. “Would you please open your chest?” Hap tapped his breastbone. The compartment slid open. The heart looked as it had the night before. It beat. The gears moved. Vic couldn’t stop the sense of pride he felt then, the accomplishment tinged with guilt. “And this?” Dad asked quietly. “Why did you keep this from me?” Vic squirmed, trying to keep his thoughts in order, but they were on the wings of butterflies, floating up around him, just out of reach. “I didn’t…” He took a deep breath and tried again. “I wanted to…” What? He went with something that didn’t feel like a lie. “Because I didn’t know if it would work.” Dad nodded slowly. “Why did you make it?” Why indeed? He said the only thing he could. “I had to know if I could do it like you did. Just in case.” Dad rose from his crouch, and before Vic could move, wrapped him in a hug, holding him close. Vic hooked his chin over Dad’s shoulder. Hap was watching them closely, head tilted slightly, eyes unblinking. “You wonderful boy,” Dad whispered. “You foolish, lovely boy.” He
