trees bent in a storm. Mrs. King spotted guests picking at the gilt-work, estimating the value. I could tell you the price, she thought. Winnie had costed them up, the buyers primed and ready. They were of near-incalculable value, and yet they looked dull and dreary beside the flower arches and the walls hung with silks. A palm tree the size of an omnibus lapped at them gently. It was beaded with sweat, teardrops running all the way down the trunk. Mrs. King wasn’t one for hanging about. She saw Miss de Vries’s eyes on the clock, too. “Shall we get down to it?” she asked. Miss de Vries nodded, curt. “Yes.” “Your father spoke to me just before he died. I imagine he spoke to you, too.” Miss de Vries quickened a half step. “He did.” There was no tension in Miss de Vries’s face. No expression at all. Dangerous, that. The women paused on the threshold of the ballroom and together they surveyed the room, their triumph. The crowd was immense, and the air smelled of musk and perfume and sweat.

Was it cruel, having this conversation now, tonight—here? In public? Perhaps. But she perceived a sparkle of provocation in Miss de Vries’s eyes. “I really do,” Mrs. King said. Miss de Vries moved slowly, her costume rippling. The refreshments had been set out in the anteroom, an abundance of lemonade, iced sherbet, wafers, bonbons. She picked two glasses of champagne from a tray and handed one to Mrs. King. “Go on, then,” said Miss de Vries, sipping from her glass. She closed her eyes as she did it. Swallowed. “I can see you’re simply itching to say something to me. The floor is yours. Speak.” Mrs. King studied her own champagne, tiny bubbles splitting, bursting, one by one. “I had everything upside down,” she said. “And so did you. Your father pulled the wool over our eyes.” The music surged, and the dancers shifted, too. “We’ve lived our lives back to front. You must have thought me an
