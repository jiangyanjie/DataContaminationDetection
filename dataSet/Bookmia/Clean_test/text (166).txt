looks smug, and I internally remind her she’s meant to be on my side. I am on the side of truth! I look at Alex again and smile hard. “I’m fine, just a little clumsy.” * * * But my thoughts follow me through the park and up to his flat. It’s halfway through the film when Alex kisses me. I know where he wants things to go and for one brief, inexcusable moment, I tell myself sex will make up for my lies. It has to because I need him. I need a pause from my life and the emotional turmoil determined to come with it. I get that respite when I’m not being me. I get that respite with Alex. My cardigan comes off and goose bumps cover my skin. It’s okay. I like Alex. I like him a lot. He’s kind and thoughtful and easy. That’s why you’re having sex with him. That is the only reason why. But I can’t connect his lips to my skin. I stare at his living room ceiling and think maybe I’m not a fan of foreplay. “Is this okay?” he asks, positioning himself above me. I nod and he doesn’t read my mind. When he enters me, it’s less painful than it was with Ben, but it isn’t comfortable; I shift under him because I feel like he’s in the wrong place, even though he can’t be.

I feel my body is being used, but I can’t understand why when this is something I told myself I wanted. * * * There’s silence between us after. I ignore it, but it follows us to the kitchen. I watch Alex as he watches the kettle. I don’t want to speak into the silence because I’m scared of what it will give back. Alex taps the counter; I feel him gearing up. He pours hot water into a mug with a green tea bag at the bottom and places it in front of me. Then he takes a seat at the dining table. “There’s something you’re not telling me,” he says quietly. I want to hold it in, to lie again. I’m just so good at it. For something so universally condemned, lying truly appeals to me; it often seems like the only way to maintain peace and comfortable continuity. But another part of me is tired—tired of pretending and keeping track, tired of being worn out after sex, like I’ve spent the entire time running away from my own shadow. “I don’t particularly
