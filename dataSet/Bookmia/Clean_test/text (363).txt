then there’s the woman. Her expression morphs, too, into something knowing and intrigued. “You’re Greg’s girlfriend. That Elsie.” She looks between me and Jack once, twice, and then holds her hand out to me. “I’ve heard so much about you. It’s really nice to meet you. I’m George.” My brain halts. “Well, Georgina. Sepulveda. But please, call me George.” Her smile is warm and welcoming, as though I’m a dear friend of Jack’s whom she’s been dying to meet. “Georgina Sepulveda,” I mouth, barely audible. The name unlocks a drawer in my brain, full of scientific papers, TED Talks, conference addresses. Georgina Sepulveda, young physics hotshot. I’m a fan of her work. She doesn’t look familiar—she is. “Yup, that’s me.” Her hand is still outstretched. I should take it. “I work with Jack.” “George,” Jack warns. “Okay, technically not yet. But I’ll start at MIT next year. What? Come on, Jack. I got the formal offer, sent back the signed contract this morning. I can tell people.” She gives me a conspiratorial look. My stomach churns. “You’re a librarian, right? I love libraries.” Next to me, Cece sucks in a breath. Meanwhile, I nod. It must be an automatic reaction, because all my neural cells are busy, sluggishly processing what I just heard. Georgina. George. MIT. Formal offer. No. No, no, no. There is lead in my belly. Blood thumps in my ears, and — I take a step back, and for a split second my mind skitters to a place far away: my apartment. The computer I left on the bed. The half-written manuscript on it—the one I was finally going to finish when I got the MIT job. But I didn’t get it. George did, George who’s with Jack, and it’s over. I gave it my all, and it wasn’t enough. “Elsie,” Jack starts. He must have moved, because George and Cece have disappeared behind him. His throat bobs. “Unsuccessful candidates are not notified until all paperwork is complete.” I shake my head and he falls silent. His eyes are full of compassion, of sincere, heartbreaking sorrow. I cannot bear to watch it. I turn around slowly. Step away just as slowly, barely taking in the sidewalk. The man walking his husky. The group of students feigning excitement for an upcoming Truffaut retrospective. I walk past them and I walk some more, unhurried, like everything’s going to be fine. Everything will be all right. I’m at the red crosswalk light when I hear, “Elsie?” It’s Cece, calling from where I left her behind. I ignore her. “Is everything okay?” George. “Shit, did I do something?” Cece doesn’t answer her. “Elsie, let’s . . . let’s just go home.” Silence. Then Jack: “Elsie. Come back, please.” He sounds like his eyes looked, and it’s simply intolerable. The crossing light turns green. I take a deep breath, let the cold air fill my lungs, and start running. 13 A N N I H I L AT I O N I RUN ONE BLOCK . One and a half. Two. Snowflakes stick to
