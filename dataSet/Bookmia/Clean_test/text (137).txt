starting to think there’s more to this than a simple desire to eat off clean plates, but I’m not going to say anything to him about it. If there’s something Finn wants to share with me, something he wants to put in the book, then he’ll tell me when he’s ready. At least, I hope so. Based on the way he quickly turns back to the dishwasher, shielding his face from me, I’m not sure he’s ready. “It’s not a big deal,” he rushes to say. “Is there something you need? I can hand-wash it for you, or—” “Nope,” I say, holding up my Nalgene. “Wash away. I was just coming to get some water. And maybe check on the AC, though I’m not sure I’d be able to diagnose what’s wrong.” He finishes up, dropping in a dishwasher pod. The hum of the machine fills the space, creating an oddly soothing harmony with the AC. “If you’re ready to—” I start, just as he says, “I was thinking about—” Both of us hurry to backtrack. He gestures for me to speak, and I force myself to take a deep breath. “I was just going to say, if you’ve settled in, maybe we could start in my bedroom?” His eyebrows jump to his hairline. “To . . . work on the book?” The book. Obviously. “No, uh—we can do that out here, of course,” I say, my face flaming. Finn has a call scheduled with his manager first, which ends right around when the dishes do, so I unload everything.

Thank you.” He brings the bags to the kitchen counter, the two of us stumbling around each other. “Thought I could whip something up if you’re hungry. If you don’t mind eating vegetarian.” He has to speak loudly to be heard over the sound of the AC. “I don’t mind!” I shout back. Then the house emits one final clatter as the air-conditioning breaks. * * * We scrounge up some fans from the closets, open all the windows before realizing the air outside is too hot and then shutting them again. We debate leaving the house before realizing we’re in the suburbs and the first five Ubers we try to get decline the trip. So we decide to tough it out. I changed into cutoffs and a tank top, and even with my short hair, I’m still scraping sweat off the back of my neck. Finn’s in a heather gray T-shirt and gym shorts, a bowl of fresh berries waiting on the counter for me. While he cooks, I pepper him with basic questions, the kind that are easy to answer in between chopping onions. He talks me through his career before The Nocturnals, because his audition is widely documented online. The story goes, a nineteen-year-old Finn started talking about Middle-earth during a callback because one of the producers
