She carried a candle into her bedroom. She dropped the bags from her back to the floor, where they lay like two heaps on the rug. She stripped, shivering as the bloodstained linen peeled off her skin. A quick shower, Marisol had told her. Because it was the middle of the night, and they must always be ready for the hounds to come. Iris washed by candlelight. It was dark and warm, the steam curling up from the tiles, and she stood in the shower, her eyes closed and her skin burning as she scrubbed. She scrubbed as if she could wash it all away. Her ears still held a faint ring; she wondered if it would ever fade. She knocked something off the soap ledge. The clang made her jump, her heart faltering. She almost cowered, but slowly told herself she was fine. She was in the shower, and it was just a metal tin of Marisol’s lavender shampoo. When Iris was certain she had washed away the dirt and the sweat and the blood, she shut off the valve and dried herself. She didn’t even want to look at her body, the marks on her skin. Bruises and cuts to remind her what she had experienced. She thought of Roman as she drew on her nightgown. He lingered in her mind as she worked the tangles from her damp hair. When would he wake? When should she return to him? “Iris?” Marisol called. “Breakfast!” Breakfast, in the middle of the night. Iris set her comb aside and carried her candle down the stairs, into the kitchen. At the smell of the food, her stomach clenched. She was so hungry, but she wasn’t sure if she would be able to eat. “Here, start with the cocoa,” Attie said, offering a steaming cup to Iris. Iris took it gratefully, sinking into her usual chair. Marisol continued to set down plates on the table. She had made some sort of cheesy hash, full of comforting ingredients, and gradually, Iris was able to begin taking a few bites. The warmth trickled through her; she sighed and felt herself slowly returning to her body. Attie and Marisol sat and ate with her, but they were quiet. And Iris was thankful. She didn’t think she could speak of it yet. Just having them close beside her was all she needed. “Can I help you clean, Marisol?” Attie asked, rising to gather the dishes when they were done. “No, I’ve got this. Why don’t you help Iris to her room?” Marisol said. Iris’s eyes were heavy. Her feet felt like iron as she rose, and Attie took hold of her arm. She hardly remembered ascending the stairs, or Attie opening her door and guiding her inside. “Do you want me to stay with you tonight, Iris?” Iris sank to her pallet on the floor. The blankets were cold. “No, I’m so tired I don’t think sleeping will be an issue. But wake me if a siren sounds.” She hardly remembered falling asleep. Iris woke with a start.
