her neighbor’s behind with it. Marion glanced at the clock. Forty-five more minutes to go. She’d been working as an instructor at the Broadway Ballet and Dance Studio for two years now, after having studied here herself since the age of five. Miss Stanwich, the kindly owner and founder, had asked her to teach the beginners part-time when Marion was a senior in high school, and most days she had a knack for corralling even the feistiest of children. The studio was like her second home, and if anyone asked, she’d say that she enjoyed her job immensely. Although, to be honest, she’d enjoyed it much more before Miss Stanwich retired and moved to North Carolina. Marion had been asked to stay on by the studio’s new owner, Miss Beaumont, who, unfortunately, was difficult to please on the best of days. Marion put her fingers into her mouth and let out a whistle loud enough that the taxis gliding on Broadway three floors below might have pulled over in hope of a fare. It also served to bring Tabitha’s mother to the glass viewing window that connected the studio to the waiting room, where she stood peering with disapproval over her reading glasses, a copy of Woman’s Day clutched to her chest. At the sound of Marion’s whistle, all ten girls miraculously fell into place, making two rows of five. Marion signaled for the accompanist to begin playing and led her tiny dancers through another round of pliés. “Imagine you’re surrounded by marshmallows.” Marion faced them, demonstrating. “Use your knees to gently push the marshmallows out, and then they gently push back, until your legs are straight. Necks long, like you’re wearing a dangly pair of earrings and want to show them off.” For a glorious few minutes, she had their rapt attention, until Tabitha plunked down on the floor. “I want a marshmallow,” she demanded. “Me too!” chimed in Dottie. Whenever her students became fidgety, Marion couldn’t bring herself to resort to what some of the newly hired instructors did, namely, snap at them and scare them back into focusing on her. While the other teachers had no problem wrenching a student’s feet into the proper turnout with a forceful hand or humiliating a struggling dancer in front of her classmates, Marion vowed to never stoop to such behaviors. After all, dancing was supposed to be joyful. Although right then no one in the room was feeling much joy at all, including Marion. She walked over to the accompanist and whispered in her ear. The students, sensing that something was up, quieted, and even Tabitha rose to her feet, curious. “It’s time for freestyle,” said Marion, and was rewarded with cheers. The accompanist broke into Carl Perkins’s “Blue Suede Shoes” as the girls assembled against the side wall in a line. Marion pointed at the first dancer, who sailed across the studio floor, performing a mad jumble of moves that involved a great deal of shimmying, jumping, and twirling. One child rolled around on the floor, finishing off with a crablike
