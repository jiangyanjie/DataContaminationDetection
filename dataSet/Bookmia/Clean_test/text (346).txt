mean. Can you imagine that girl running Fairhurst? Poor Lady Ashley.” “Poor nothing. Just think of the weekend parties. The trapeze artists! The dancing girls!” “The camels, darling!” They broke off into laughter, reaching for more wine. “Oi,” said a voice at Winnie’s ear. She turned and started. Behind her, eyes narrowed, stood one of Mrs. Bone’s men. His jaw was clenched. Winnie backed behind the marquee. “What are you doing?” she muttered. “We’re off.” “What?” “We’re getting out. This place is swarming with peelers.” Winnie looked around, searching for Mrs. King. “Nonsense,” she said. “Everything is simply fine. Go back inside.” “Can’t.” He nodded at the distant figure of the princess, moving slowly through the crowd. “Not now she’s here.” “Then you’ll need to improvise.” Winnie held his stare. “You don’t leave this house until Mrs. King gives the word.” For a second she feared he might refuse to obey her, might tell her to go and fetch Mrs. King. I would if I could, she thought desperately. But then he nodded again, a quick, smart little duck of the chin. “Yes, ma’am.” Equals, Winnie said to herself, almost in disbelief. We’re all equals... * * * Mrs. King was frog-marched downstairs by Lockwood’s clerks. “I can see myself out,” she said angrily, shaking their hands off her arm. “Mr. Lockwood said—” “Hang Mr. Lockwood,” said Mrs. King. But they steered her through the front hall, avoiding a huge crowd of guests that seemed to be processing toward the garden. Mrs. King couldn’t see who had arrived. She felt the mob rolling, not steered, not marshaled. Evidently, Hephzibah was busy elsewhere. A sudden fear pulled on Mrs. King’s heart. She was required here: to direct things. But she needed to get to Alice first. Dunce, she thought, directing all her anger on herself. Idiot. Even the Janes had sensed a risk with Alice, but not her. She was incapable of understanding other people’s feelings. She always had been. It was clear at once what had happened. She’d seen the way Alice had bent her head toward Miss de Vries, yearning toward her, fixing that awful, splendid gown. She’d been snared. Alice wasn’t a canary. She was a mouse, right in the trap. Lockwood was sizing her up. Mrs. King’s instincts told her everything she needed to know. She felt sick, frightened. “Off you go,” said the clerks, disposing of her on the front step, very nearly pushing her into the road. She didn’t talk back: she hurtled to the tradesmen’s entrance, trying to double back inside before they spotted her. This time it was harder to get in: there were crates of wine obstructing the door, waiters smoking. She had to push her way through the crowd of servants, speeding up the servants’ staircase, panting. The sound of the orchestra grew duller as she reached the second floor. There was a door half-open, letting in a soft breeze. Mrs. King nudged it open with her toe. Empty. I should have planned for this, she thought. She should have made arrangements to
