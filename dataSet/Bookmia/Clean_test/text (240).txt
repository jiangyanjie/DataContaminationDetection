immense and homely, and seem so close I can almost imagine running right into them if we could cross the neighboring field. When I lived here, I used to walk to another field near our old house to watch the sky darken above gold-limned hills. Sometimes, driving home in the evening, I’d pull over to admire the view—the riotous colors of sunset, the slow-deepening blue of the mountains as the light receded. I’ve relaxed at peaceful eastern lakes and walked along Atlantic beaches, but have yet to find any substitute for these mountains. There’s a reason my mother still sends me cards featuring photographs and watercolors of snow-covered peaks and foothills clustered with evergreens—she knows how much I miss the geography of home. Every time I return, it’s the Cascades that greet me first, from the window of a small plane. Without words, without answers, they offer me the same peace they always have. I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. I can feel my mind ease a fraction, though my anxieties are slower to dissipate than the strands of fog clinging to the base of the hills.

The day we buried him, there was a sun shower, and we gathered outside to see a rainbow arching over the peaks. Some hours later, when the overcast sky gave way to a fiery orange-and-rose sunset, one of the best I could ever remember seeing, Mom sighed and squeezed my hand. Quite a send-off. My father never feels closer or farther away than when I return to this place to find him gone. Now I’m walking a dog he never met, wondering if he knows what my mother is facing; what we are going through without him. I turn around, the mountains a reassuring wall at my back, and let Buster lead us home for lunch. 16 On the day after Christmas, I took my mother out to her favorite diner. My husband, kids, and I had flown to Oregon to spend the week with her, and my sister, Cindy, and her family made the trip down from Portland with a carful of Christmas decorations to deck the halls of our Airbnb. My mom didn’t have extra beds or space for guests, and we wanted her to be able
