didn’t start until after he passed away. But everything else occurred before. That’s only because I was unhappy at work—another hard time. Comments: Dinah: It’s scary how many of these symptoms I’ve been displaying lately. Joel: This wasn’t helpful. Everyone feels all of these things some time or other. Frances: I have to say these symptoms are all very vague and the last note misleading and detrimental. To attribute the symptoms of depression solely to “hard times” may have you feeling like you should wait it out instead of seeking professional help. What if you’re going through a series of “hard times”? You’ll be waiting for the storm to pass until you’re dead. Depression varies from person to person. For example, I had extreme mood swings, which isn’t mentioned above and is rarely talked about regarding depression. I was on cloud nine one day and being tormented in hell the next, and things did not change until I got help. So you need to ask yourself (and answer truthfully): do you think you’re depressed?

She has on the same blue eye shadow she wore during my interview. Her blond hair is even shorter now and it sticks up in corners she maybe can’t see. “Maddie,” she says. “I don’t know if you’re aware, but we have a counselor who comes into the building twice a month.

You did seem perkier this morning, but I imagine your feelings during a time like this alternate in waves.” I’m burning with embarrassment at the idea of being the Girl Who Clearly Can’t Cope. I briefly put myself in Penny’s shoes. She must hate having this conversation as much as I hate hearing it. She shouldn’t have to deal with secondhand grief. I already know Kris and Eliza have lost someone and they didn’t mention needing a counselor brought in. “I’m fine,” I insist. “I can get my work done, same as every—” I cut myself off thinking of Katherine, crying in the toilets, working when her mental health was at risk, pretending everything was okay. I asked Claire if it mattered people thought her weak, so long as she got help. I’d no idea I’d struggle to take my own advice. Depression can do that to a person. I shake my head and say nothing. “We want to help you, Maddie,” Penny says. “Career longevity is our goal with you here at OTP—hence our
