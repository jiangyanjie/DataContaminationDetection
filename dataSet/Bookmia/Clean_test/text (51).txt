Not only does she do a much better job at transmitting the messages than an embarrassed husband ever could, but she also carries herself well—showing equal respect to the doctor and to the patient. The young wife recently gave birth. She suffers from severe itching on her ears, cheeks, and the nape of her neck. She sobs, hiding her tears with her sleeves. “I’m lonely. My husband doesn’t listen to me. He pays no attention to my advice.” Meiling disappears behind the screen to pass on these words. Since Doctor Wong can’t see the patient, Meiling also describes the young woman’s red and scaled face and the patches where she’s scratched so much the skin oozes. The two visitors and I hear her clearly when she adds, “As a midwife, I’ve seen cases of postpartum Wind itching many times. This happens when the childbirth gate is too long exposed during labor. Do you remember, Doctor Wong, how long her baby took to come out? Your good judgment saved two lives that day.” Silence falls over the room as Doctor Wong considers this information. Finally, he declares, repeating the diagnosis Meiling just gave him, “Tell the patient she suffers from postpartum Wind itching.” He gives the same prescription I would have recommended to refill the empty spaces between the layers of the girl’s skin, but he doesn’t suggest anything to help with her itching. From behind the curtain, Doctor Wong speaks again. “The goal of a male doctor is to see that a woman lives out her predetermined fate and destiny to have children. These things are controlled by Heaven.” “Thank you for that, Doctor Wong,” Lady Liu says politely, but inside I burn. I rise and walk to the window, so our guests won’t see the emotions cross my face. It may not be decorous to say aloud, but we women—rich, poor, educated, uneducated—are at the mercy of our bodies: the cycles of blood, the patterns of energy, the depth and complexity of our feelings. Heaven has nothing to do with any of that. I compose my face and turn back to the room to find Lady Liu sitting on the kang next to the young wife, the two of them with their heads together as they whisper. Widow Bao and Meiling stand in the farthest corner of the room, also whispering. It seems both sets of women wish to share confidences away from Doctor Wong’s ears. I clear my throat and approach the kang. Lady Liu rises, and Widow Bao sways away from Meiling. We take turns leaning down to thank the young wife for allowing us to observe as Doctor Wong treated her. This is accompanied by separate messages from each of us spoken in tones that can’t possibly reach him. “It is a rare husband who listens to his wife, let alone takes her advice,” Widow Bao says gently. “Don’t let this trouble your mind any longer.” “Thank you for telling me about the birth of your daughter,” murmurs Lady Liu. “Next time you’ll have a son.” “I’ll tell
