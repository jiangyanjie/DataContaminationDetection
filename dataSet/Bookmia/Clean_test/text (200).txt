distracted when he was putting it on, or maybe had a long day and the button simply gave up. “I’m sorry, though,” he says. “About your work, and your relationship.” I wave this off. “Thanks, but it’ll be okay. I think.” I hope. I could easily turn away, tell him to have a nice evening. Down my drink in silence and stumble home to takeout, trashy TV, and wallowing. I’ve never chatted someone up at a bar before—I’m usually too busy avoiding eye contact with other humans—but something about him compels me to keep talking. Because full honesty: maybe my ego needs a little boost tonight. “What about you?” I say, picking up my bottle and gesturing toward his glass. “You’re drinking alone because . . .” When I trail off, I watch his face, catching a split-second flinch. It’s so brief, I’m not sure he’s aware he’s doing it—maybe I even imagined it. But then he collects himself. Seems to relax. “Same as you. Career-related existential dread.” He motions to the pair of bartenders, dropping the volume of his voice. “I was going to head out twenty minutes ago, but then I got too invested in their personal lives.” He taps a finger to his lips, and I strain to hear what the bartenders are saying. “Those guinea pigs are not my responsibility. If you’re going to insist on keeping them in our apartment, you need to clean up after them.” “You could at least call them by their names.” “I refuse to call those little beasts Ricardo and Judith.” “Just like you refused to do the dishes after that party you threw last week? The one with a build-your-own-chili-dog bar?” “I want to call you out for eavesdropping, but I can’t blame you,” I say. “This is quality entertainment.” “Right? Now I can’t leave until I know how it ends.” Then he raises an eyebrow, squinting at the water bottle I stupidly placed on the bar next to me. “Is there a reason your water bottle says . . . ‘Live Laugh Girlboss’?” He holds up his hands. “Not judging, just curious.” “Oh, this? I’m part of a hydration-based MLM. I’m in really deep. They’ll be running the docuseries any day now.” Without missing a beat, he calmly places his glass back down. Flicks his eyes around the bar. When he speaks again, it’s in a whisper. “Do I need to call someone for you?” “Afraid it’s too late.” I give the water bottle a shake. “But if I can sell you a thousand of these babies, I might be able to get off with minimal prison time.” “The thing is,” he says, drumming a couple fingertips on the bar, “I could probably find a use for three hundred. Maybe four. But I don’t know what I’d do with the rest of them.” “You’d just have to find other people to sell them to. I could hook you up, give you all the training you need to become your very own boss.” “I’m not falling for that one.” He’s grinning
