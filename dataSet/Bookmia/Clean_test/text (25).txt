in the morning.” “I’ll miss that too,” Kimmy says. “And sitting on the bench next to the walk-up window, petting all the dogs that come past. And all the junk shops and yard sales. Every time I come here, I end up trying to convince Cleo to rent a U-Haul to drive back.” “A garden filled with lobster traps has a different aesthetic effect in upstate New York,” Cleo says. “Yeah, but we could at least cover our walls with wood-burned signs that say Wicked Pissah.” “Well, now we know what to get you for your birthday,” I say. “Should we all get wicked pissah tattoos?” Parth jokes. “We can do better than that,” Sabrina says. “Giant lobsters,” Wyn puts in. “Mermaids that look like Bratz dolls,” I suggest. “I’ll come up with something.” Sabrina props her chin in one hand, the other fluttering through the shallow water. “What’s something you’ll miss, Harry?” Cleo asks. “Something small.” I say, “Seeing everyone so happy together.” Cleo bats her hand against my leg. “Something for you.” I think some more. “I guess . . . going to sleep.” Parth bursts into laughter. “I’m serious!” I cry. “Your favorite part,” Sabrina says, “of this amazing trip I planned for us . . . is going to sleep.” “No.” I toss a seashell shard toward the sparkling lip of the tide. “It’s going to sleep so tired, in a good way.

The least I can do is appreciate it.” We get back onto the boat as the sun is beginning its descent. The water is diamond edged, the air cooling and the spray lifting off the sides of the boat positively freezing, despite the sun beating against the crowns of our heads. At the helm, Sabrina glows. She’s where she’s meant to be, doing what she was born to do, and no matter how complicated this week has been, I now realize how worth it it all was. Parth passes out a round of Coronas with lime wedges—and soda for Cleo —and Sabrina cranks up the radio, Bruce Springsteen’s “Dancing in the Dark” crackling out. It feels like time has been canceled, thrown out, suspended indefinitely. As long as we stay out here on the water, salt spray flecking our skin, nothing else exists. Kimmy wrangles Cleo into a slow dance, and Parth and I heckle them from our benches until the combination of the setting sun and beer has me heavy eyed and yawning. Beside me, Wyn lifts his arm in invitation, and either
