has it? An encyclopaedia of faeries? This will form a cornerstone of all scholarship on the subject for years to come. Probably it will lead to the formation of new methodologies that will enhance our core understanding of the Folk.” He said it without any hint of flattery. I could only reply honestly, a little overwhelmed, “Yes, that was the intention.” He smiled. “I thought so. You don’t need the chapter on the Hidden Ones, you know.” “It will be less impressive without it.” “And who is it you are wishing to impress? Ah.” He leaned back in his chair. “The faculty position. That’s it, isn’t it?” “And if it is?” I couldn’t interpret the look on his face. “You don’t think I have a chance?” “Well, you’re a little young—” “And you’re not?” Cambridge had given him tenure two years ago, the bastard. “I’m an exception.” He said it absently, looking down at the pages, and a smile came over his face. “When is old Sutherland retiring?” “This fall.” I was leaning forward, twisting my fingers together. “I plan to put my name forward when I return.

I assumed he would have told you.” I winced. “Egilson and I have not been on the best of terms.” “What?” He gave an exaggerated affectation of surprise. “Dear Emily. Don’t tell me you’ve had trouble making friends.” My scowl was interrupted by the creak of the door. As before, Krystjan strode into the cottage without knocking. I could tell by his expression that Bambleby’s message had been as well received as I had guessed. Lizzie trailed behind him, looking uselessly apologetic. “Mr. Egilson!” Bambleby was on his feet immediately, his smile broadening. “I see that you don’t stand for formalities, my good man. How refreshing. I must convey how much I appreciate your hospitality at such short notice. I had heard tales of the warmth and generosity of your compatriots, but you have gone above and beyond.” He said all of this in accented but fluent Ljoslander. It stopped Egilson in his
