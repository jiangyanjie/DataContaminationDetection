be thankful that a substantial raise and my first book royalty check finally allowed me to help my mother. It all came too late to be of any use to my father. * * * I am still anxious when making a big purchase, whether it is necessary or not, and usually have to work myself up to justifying it. The car is fifteen years old, the air conditioner can’t be repaired, it’s too small for all of us to be comfortable on long road trips → expenditure reluctantly approved. I tend to choose smaller, less important things—sneakers, nightstands, the number of streaming services we pay for—to be stingy about, as if that will compensate for money I’m forced to spend elsewhere. If I want to splurge on something, I will tell myself that I have to take on a freelance assignment or speaking engagement, earn additional income, to make up for it. And yet I feel an undeniable thrill when I buy “nice things” for myself or for others, because to me it will always seem like a luxury to spend money on something I want but don’t strictly need. In contrast, my husband’s approach to finances is rational, evenhanded, devoid of fear or strong emotion. He’s never had a meltdown over math. He can see the numbers in the columns for what they are: incoming funds, outgoing expenses, things we want, and things we need. He does not find himself worrying or becoming upset because our kids, like many, do not yet understand the advantages they have.

While both his family and mine might have described themselves as “middle class,” there’s an ocean, deep and wide, between our formative experiences around money and stability, and this disparity continues to influence our instincts and decisions around saving and spending. I know it’s a good thing that he doesn’t make financial decisions from the same bottomless well of worry I do, but sometimes I can’t help but envy his sense of security, the reassurance that comes with a lifetime of believing that you will most likely be okay. Witnessing his calm consistency can also make me feel foolish for fretting, though he would never condemn me for it. I tell myself that I should be able to recognize how lucky I am, put away these fears once and for all. I remind myself that I have taken risks, made decisions that were neither frugal nor practical, and it wasn’t the end of the world: my financial anxiety couldn’t override my desire to become a parent, a notoriously expensive proposition; nor did it stop me from pursuing a career in writing, a job that supports me now but might not a year from now. I did these things despite assuming, for years, that I might also need to be my parents’ retirement plan. Yet even when things are going well, I half expect to lose what
