see you up and about,” Stefan says. “Yeah. Thank you.” “Oh, you’re welcome, of course. As I said, you turned out to be more interesting than I’d imagined. A seasoning process, no doubt. Suffering and age. I might have done it anyway, even without Athena’s urging. If I’d heard in time.” “Maybe Elaine would have called you.” “Maybe. Thank you for that, by the way. Not just for taking care of her, but she was so moved by your situation that she’s in treatment now herself. Out in a few more months—the brain takes longer, you know. All’s well that ends well. What will you do now?” “I think we can say the cops aren’t interested in retaining my services any more.” “No, I fear not. Rather too messy and ambiguous an outcome.” “Are you asking me if I want a job?” “Genuine curiosity.” “The same, maybe. But from the other side of the line.” “Ah, yes. Perhaps. I think that would be…helpful.” He shrugs, water running down his back, then looks over at Athena. “It’s so nice for her. Finally, she has everything she wanted. You, of course. But also Elaine getting better, and Maurice out of the picture. The man who tormented her mother is dead. And she even has a little something to hold over me, if I ever get too patriarchal with her. Quite the fortunate outcome, and she never had to lift a finger. I’m very proud.” He flashes me a grin, and I see all his teeth. “Excuse me, Cal. I must get back in. I find the water infinitely more convivial than dry land, these days.” “Sure. See you round.” “Count on it, Cal.” He splashes into the pool like a child. Athena waves at me from the lounger. I think about what happened in the spaces between what I’ve already found out: how did Roddy Tebbit hear that Elaine might be an ally in Stefan’s camp? How did Maurice come to know who Roddy really was? The smallest intersections of lives; coincidences that add up to one particular ending. I remember Elaine’s face as she hit him, and the years of pain drained out of her into the dark. I realise I’m proud of Athena too.
