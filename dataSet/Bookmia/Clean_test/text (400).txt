Hap whispered. Vic stopped in front of Hap, taking his hands and holding them tightly. “The horns. The piano. The drums and the hi-hat. Miles Davis. It’s blue. It’s a kind of blue. Listen.” He couldn’t remember it all. His mind was still shorting out, his breaths still ragged. But he hummed what he could. “Blue in Green.” The muted trumpet, that sharp metallic sound, the flutter of piano keys. His voice was cracked, his head full of fireworks. He swayed from side to side as he held onto Hap. Distantly, he was aware that Nurse Ratched had begun to play the very song he was humming. And though it had no words, Rambo joined in, his voice soft and low. “Butterfly,” Hap said faintly. “Nice. Pretty.” Vic didn’t know how long it lasted. It felt like hours, though it was only minutes. Incrementally, Hap relaxed, bit by bit. It started in his legs and rolled its way through his hips and chest. He sagged against Vic, his face buried in Vic’s neck. The music faded as Vic whispered, “There. See? All is well. We’re okay. You’re okay. I’ve got you.” Hap clutched at him, teeth bared against Vic’s throat. “You saved us. Right?” He jostled Hap. “You saved us. Thank you. The blood. If that had hit the floor…” “If it h-had hit the f-f-floor, it w-would have triggered an alarm. But—” “Then you did what you had to,” Vic said fiercely. “You protected us.” Hap didn’t look relieved when he pulled back, but his haunted expression had softened. His eyes searched Vic’s, and what he found there must have been enough. He turned toward the HARP. “It’s g-gone offline. Someone wwill notice soon. We h-have to hurry.” He bent over, sliding his hands underneath the arms of the HARP, pieces of his head falling back to the floor. Hap pulled the HARP farther into the room. Rambo followed behind him, scooping up the pieces that remained. Vic stepped out into the hall, looking left and right to make sure they were still alone. They were. He picked up his pack from the ground. Something shifted inside, a metallic clink that caused him to pause. He frowned as he lifted the pack, shaking it from side to side. The sound was louder, broken. His eyes widened as he opened the pack furiously. “Victor?” Nurse Ratched asked. “Your heart rate has elevated drastically. What is wrong?” He barely heard her. “No,” he muttered. “No, please, no, where is it, where is it, where is it—” He closed his hand around a familiar cloth and yanked. He’d grabbed the wrong side. The cloth opened as he pulled it out, spraying the remains of the heart onto the floor. That sound. That terrible crunch he’d heard when he’d smashed the pack against the HARP without thinking. It’d been the newly constructed heart breaking once more. The wood had split into four distinct pieces, two of which fell to the floor, the remaining two back into the pack. Wires dangled uselessly. One of the gears
