has to be a huge undertaking. Who knows what the future holds, right? Besides, you have someone waiting for you back home, right? The guy with the flashy car?” Was that a touch of jealousy in Peter’s question? Or was he relieved that it appeared she was already taken? She couldn’t tell what he was thinking. “No. I broke it off with him.” “You did?” He looked at her with wide eyes. Marion nodded, trying to add a cheery, breezy note to her voice. “Of course, like you said, who knows what’s ahead, right?” “That’s true.” The waiter came by, asking about dessert. They both declined. Later, outside, Marion stepped in front of him as he tried to hail a cab. “Peter, what’s going on? I thought that we—” He let his hand fall to his side. “We do, but—” She didn’t want to hear what else was coming. Instead, she reached up and took his face in her hands and kissed him. He pulled her close, wrapping his arms around her waist, and they stayed like that for what seemed like minutes, lips on fire, pressed against each other. She hadn’t imagined it.

But Marion’s humiliation was complete. “No. I don’t want to hear it. I’ve had enough.” She rolled down the taxi window all the way as she zoomed uptown, the sting of the cold air adding to the sting of her tears. * * * Marion woke with a throbbing headache. She was still confused about why her relationship with Peter had suddenly nose-dived. Maybe, because they had both lived through the roller-coaster ride of the past few weeks, it was destined to turn sour. He knew her at her worst, when she was grief-stricken and wild. That wasn’t what a man wanted in a partner. She’d hoped Peter would be different from most men. She pushed him from her mind. That day, she was determined to track down her father. It was time to deal with the consequences of what she’d done, of what he’d done. First, though, she went to the Hoags’ office in Times Square to sign the contract for her new job. The salary was even more than she expected, and she’d be able to afford her
