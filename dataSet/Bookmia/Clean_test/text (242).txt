his mustache. “I promise to make it as pleasant as possible.” “You old flirt,” Nurse Ratched said in her flat voice. “I know your type.” The Coachman grinned at her. “I bet you do.” He grunted as he tipped her over, her screen facing the ceiling. “Do protect him, won’t you? He’s … precious.” “I know,” Nurse Ratched said. “Coachman?” “Yes, my sweet?” “If we are betrayed, if Bernard attempts to notify anyone of our presence in the city, I will find a way out. I will come for him first. And when I have finished with him, I will find you. There is nowhere in the world you can run. Every day, for the rest of your life, you will have to look over your shoulder. When you least expect it, I will be there. I will stick my drill so far inside you that you will taste it. And then I will turn it on and scramble everything that makes you who you are.” “I wouldn’t expect anything less,” the Coachman said. He pressed his hand against her screen. “If that happens, I will wait for you with open arms.” “Seriously,” Rambo said. “This is really gross.” Hap shoved the Coachman out of the way, setting Rambo on top of Nurse Ratched’s casing. “No t-talking,” he warned them. “Hap?” Rambo asked. “What.” “I love you.” Hap scowled at him.

Bernard motioned toward another crate set farther back. “This one is yours.” “And it’ll allow for air to move freely through it?” the Coachman asked. Bernard frowned. “Yes. As discussed. It’s meant for transporting florae and faunae.” He looked at Vic and Hap before his head spun toward the Coachman. “Why is that necessary? Are they transporting something alive?” “What?” the Coachman said, sounding outraged. “I take umbrage with your tone, sir. I would never allow something so—” “You look familiar,” Bernard said to Hap. “Have we met before?” Hap lowered his head, his hood falling around his face. “N-no.” “Hmm,” Bernard said. “Coachman, this better not come back on me.” “Of course it won’t,” the Coachman said. “There is nothing to come back on you. I don’t know what’s going through that circle you call a head, but I am an upstanding citizen. Everything I do is aboveboard,
