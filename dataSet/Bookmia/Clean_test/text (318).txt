labor. “This wasn’t your fault. It was mine.” “You mustn’t blame yourself—” She shakes her head vehemently. “You have it all wrong,” she blurts. “I was taking a formula made by Doctor Wong. What I took was meant for you. My selfishness protected you.” My body draws up, confused. “What do you mean? Doctor Wong prescribed nothing for me.” “But he did.” I wait, feeling that if I press her, she’ll retreat back into silence. But once she begins to speak again, I wish beyond all wishing that I couldn’t hear the words. “Lady Kuo asked Doctor Wong to make his best formula to protect you and your baby in the final stage of pregnancy,” she stammers. “She gave me no such thing.” “Because she probably knew you wouldn’t take it.” Another long silence. Then, “She gave the herbs to Poppy.” “Poppy?” “She was to make the formula and give it to you when you entered your seventh month. I stole the ingredients and made them into a brew for me instead.” Meiling drops her head so I can’t see her eyes. “So many sayings cover my greed and envy. The sight of treasure provides the motive… A plan is born when a man is desperate… But none is more apt than Carelessness in putting things away teaches others to steal. I knew where the ingredients were, and I took them.

Doctor Wong and I may have different ideas about Blood-warming and Blood-cooling during pregnancy—and his prescription could have counteracted what I gave you—but that wouldn’t have resulted in a miscarriage. Do you still have any of the ingredients? I want to see what he used.” With effort, Meiling rises from the bed, goes to one of her bags, digs through the contents, and returns with a silk pouch tied with woven cord. I open it and pour the contents on the quilt. As my fingers go from item to item, my heart feels as though it’s dropping to the pit of my stomach. “Well?” Meiling asks. “Ox knee is often used to expel old monthly moon water or clear the child palace of lingering blood after birth,” I answer, my throat tightening around my words. “But it can also be used on wives thought too sickly to carry a baby to term. Expelling the embryo gives the woman a chance to live.” Meiling draws a hand across her mouth as she takes this in. I can hardly get the next words out. “And here are peach kernels.” “Yes. So?” “They’re
