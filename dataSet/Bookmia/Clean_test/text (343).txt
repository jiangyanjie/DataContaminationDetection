I’ve been telling him. I’m just not the best with all the sciency stuff. And I don’t mind being a werewolf. In fact, I think I kind of kick ass at it? Caleb attempts to howl, then dissolves into a coughing fit. Well. Most of the time. HUX It’s not for him. It’s . . . for someone else. CALEB Have you even asked her, Hux? Maybe you should start there, huh? HUX Well, no. But you think if she had a choice, this is really what she’d pick? CALEB He moves closer to Hux, jabbing a finger at his chest. We have super strength, super speed, and night vision. I can hear conversations happening a mile away. I can heal myself if I get hurt.
