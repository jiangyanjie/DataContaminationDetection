pouring her a cup of perfectly brewed tea when the siren sounded. Iris stiffened, listening as the distant wail rose and fell, rose and fell. Over and over, like a creature in the throes of death. “Eithrals?” Roman asked, setting the kettle down with a clang. “No,” Iris said, standing. Her gaze was on the garden, on the breeze that raked over it. “No, this is the evacuate siren.” She had never heard it before, but she had often thought of it happening. Her feet froze to the floor as the siren continued to wail. “Iris?” Roman’s voice brought her back into the moment. He was standing beside her, intently watching her face. “Kitt.” She reached for his hand as the floor began to shake beneath her. She wondered if it was the aftershocks of a distant bomb, but the rumbling only intensified, as if something was drawing closer. There was a loud pop, and Iris instantly cowered, teeth clenched. Roman pulled her back up, holding her against his chest. His voice was warm in her hair as he whispered, “It’s just a lorry. It’s just backfire. We’re safe here.

He touched her the same way he always had, as if he wanted to savor it. As if it could be the last time. The front door blew open with a bang. Iris startled again, but Roman kept his arms around her. Someone was in the house, striding down the corridor with a heavy tread. And then came a voice, unfamiliar yet piercing. “Marisol!” A woman appeared in the kitchen. A tall soldier, dressed in an olive-green blood-splattered uniform. A rifle was strapped to her back, grenades to her belt. A golden star was pinned above her heart, revealing her status as a captain. Her blond hair was cut short, but a few tendrils shone in the light beneath her helmet. Her face was gaunt as if she hadn’t eaten properly over the past few months, but her brown eyes were keen, cutting across the kitchen to where Iris and Roman stood, embracing. At once, Iris knew her. She had been kneeling in this woman’s garden, preparing it for her return. “Keegan?” “Yes. Where’s my wife?” Keegan demanded. She hardly gave Iris the chance
