on the floor. “Very good,” Master Yang says. “You may continue.” It is a new wife’s duty to serve tea to her in-laws. My hands shake, but I’m comforted to see the gift from my grandparents—the canister of loose tea leaves. I know the tea will be of the highest quality. I brew tea, pour it, and, with my head bowed in deference, offer the first cup to my father-in-law. Once I hand the second cup to my mother-in-law, I sit back on my heels. “A family’s fortune can be foretold by whether or not its members are early risers.” My mother-in-law’s tone is no less gruff or demanding than when she shushed the children in the marriage chamber last night. “Rise before dawn and do not retire until my son is ready.” “Yes, Mother—” “I would prefer you call me Lady Kuo.” I’m not sure how to feel about this desire for formality. Does she not see me as part of the family? I will need to work hard to win her approval. “I will rise earlier tomorrow,” I promise, keeping my gaze lowered. “So be it.” And that is that.

Without any hesitancy, I can send Poppy to deliver letters to my grandparents and brother, but also to Grandmother to give to Meiling. My grandparents host a banquet for our family, but now I am only a visiting guest. Over the next two days, I barely see my husband, who spends his time with Grandfather. Perhaps they are discussing Maoren’s upcoming examinations or what position he might take once he passes, if he passes. I stay in the inner chambers. “Was your husband kind on your wedding night?” Miss Zhao inquires. “What does the house look like?” Lady Huang probes. “Tell us of your father-in-law,” White Jade urges. “Will your mother-in-law make a place for you in the household?” Green Jade wants to know. “Or in her heart?” Red Jade asks, even more pointedly. I answer that my husband was kind, but I have no one and nothing else to compare my wedding night to. The Garden of Fragrant Delights is too big for me to grasp, let alone explain. My father-in-law seemed nice enough, but I have no idea when I’ll see him again. As for my mother-in-law… “I
