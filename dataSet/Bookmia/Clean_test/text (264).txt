going to do this, I need to make sure we both know what to expect. And that means establishing all of this up front. “The book has to come first, of course. And I’m sure we’ll be done before then, but when the trip is over, we are, too. We go our separate ways and never tell anyone.” I swirl my fork through the extra peanut sauce. “Protection is nonnegotiable. And consent, obviously.” “No arguments from me there.” “If one of us ever wants to call the whole thing off, for any reason, they can,” I continue. “And it’s not going to happen every night. In fact, it’s probably better if it doesn’t, since the book needs to be our top priority. If one of us doesn’t want to, that’s it—they don’t have to defend it or make excuses.” “Frankly, I’m not sure I could, uh, perform every single night,” he says. “So that’s a relief.” Then he adds: “We should be able to feel like we can say something.

It’s just casual sex. People do this all time. I’ve done this, with this exact person. “One more thing,” I say. “I sort of made an outline? For the lessons? On the plane?” “While I was watching Ted Lasso?” I press my lips together, nodding. “I know we said it would just be ‘a few pointers,’ but I thought it might make things easier, and we’re doing the same for the memoir, so . . .” He grins at this. “That’s kind of amazing. I’m both impressed and intrigued.” I swipe around on my phone before passing it to him. “It’s a work in progress. We can adjust it based on whatever you want to work on or whatever we feel like needs more attention.” It all makes perfect logical sense—at least, I think so. We’ll start with kissing, then gradually add various forms of foreplay, with roman numeral sections devoted specifically to topics like oral sex and dirty talk. A sexual lesson plan. “This is . . .” Finn starts, staring down at it. The panic sets in. I went overboard, classic Chandler Cohen overthinking. “. . . extremely thorough,” he finishes. “Wow.
