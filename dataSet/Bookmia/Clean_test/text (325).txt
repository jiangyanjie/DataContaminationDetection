jumper before her coat, and as always my attention is first drawn to the marks on her cheeks. “Not scars, Baaba. Tribal marks.” She lives in North London and has her own list of health problems, not limited to sore joints, so she only comes by once or twice a month. But her monthly appearance serves us better than James’s. She brings Dad homemade pepper soup, which I put straight on the stove, and she sits with her brother for hours talking in Twi. Dad understands more of his language than English (maybe because he’s been speaking it since he was old enough to) and, these days, even finds it easier to communicate in. I can understand what’s being said, even when interchanged between Twi and Fante, but I wish I could speak the language. My parents spoke it all the time at home, but James and I only got as far as understanding it, always responding in English. We’d be prompted to do otherwise, but we could never grasp it and I didn’t consider it important in my more adaptable, formative years; all my friends spoke English, and I still understood what my parents were saying regardless, so why bother? I never thought a day would come when I felt left out. If I hadn’t made it clear before, let me do that now. Dad doesn’t get a lot of visitors. He never had many friends; used to be a bit of a recluse, a hermit. Mum often jokes he’s where I get my solitary nature from. She made it seem as if it’s one of Dad’s faults, that he lacks social graces. I, however, see it for what it really is: he’s an introvert. The world is filled with two different kinds of people: those who need to be surrounded by others and those who do not. Dad and I are simply the latter, James and Mum the former. Whenever Auntie Mabel comes round, I wonder what became of Dad’s few friends. I’ve never asked, and now he won’t remember. There used to be a man Dad would laugh, watch football, and drink beer with. A man I called Uncle (he wasn’t blood-related) … Richard? Albert? Caleb? I sometimes think about what happened to him. It’s possible Uncle X saw Dad’s health deteriorating and couldn’t handle it. It happens. When people are ill to the point of no return to full health, to the person they used to be, some don’t have the stomach to stick around. We don’t appreciate being reminded of our own body’s weaknesses, our lack of control and inevitable mortality. Or maybe moving from Battersea to Croydon put distance between them, a distance Uncle X couldn’t be bothered to continually cross. Now Dad doesn’t have any friends who aren’t family. Which isn’t entirely the case for me, but not too far off. If I were Dad, which of my friends would I see monthly? Who would come to visit me with a home-cooked meal? Would James even? I hang around for a few minutes, then excuse
