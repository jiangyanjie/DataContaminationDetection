When I was in school, kids would always assume they were my grandparents. And now that I’m an adult, it’s only occasionally hitting me that they’re really, really different from how they used to be. And that terrifies me sometimes.” My voice goes soft, the hum of the pool filters filling the space. “I’d be doing the same thing,” he says. “That can’t be easy.” There’s something new in his voice, a gentleness that makes me keep talking. “It’s like—each year brings me new and additional ways to worry about them.
