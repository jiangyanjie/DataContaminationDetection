find it at all. Then—the barest slink of darkness, a thin thread of latent death. Lore grabbed it like a lifeline, and wound the strand of Mortem around her hand, tugging it out as deftly as threading a needle. It flowed from the body and into her, twisting through her veins, braided into herself. Her heart froze. Tithed a beat. Her hand thrust sideways, Mortem flowing out of her and into the rosebush Anton had brought into the vault. The blooms withered instantly, leaves dropping, the soil turning dry and pale. Lore’s eyes opened, banishing the grayscale world in favor of the true one. Her veins were blackened to the elbow, her fingertips white and corpsecold. The body on the slab was still, with no visible change to mark what she’d done. This was a human, not an animal. She had to give him a direction. And though August had told her what to do, she couldn’t remember what it’d been, so she asked the question they all wanted the answer to. “Tell us what happened,” Lore whispered, the sound hoarse and broken through her death-dry throat.

A creak as it sat up. The dead body opened his eyes, and Lore couldn’t help but meet them, no matter how awful—her gaze was drawn there, even as terror set deep in her bones, even as the power that made this possible kept her eyes opaque and her veins inky, looking just as dead as he did. The child’s eyes were wholly black—no white, no iris. Darkened veins stood out around them, like the veins around her own, like the scars around Gabe’s eye patch. The child opened an empty, yawning mouth. And though his lips didn’t move, he began to whisper. CHAPTER THIRTEEN To reach for power beyond what has been given to you is the greatest sin. —The Book of Mortal Law, Tract 78 At first, the whispering was just a soft susurrus, the bare suggestion of language without any detail filled in. The sound reminded Lore of flies buzzing, of suffocating dirt, the soft fall of flesh rotted from bone. But after a moment, words conjured themselves from the shapeless noise. Just one phrase, over and over and stopping abruptly, stuck
