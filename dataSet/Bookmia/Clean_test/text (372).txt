mum. When I was at school, I’d be wishing she’d act like the other mums, pick me up from school, make me dinner, help with homework, and sometimes it looked like she’d changed, but it never lasted ’cos you can’t pretend to be someone you’re not for very long. So don’t waste your time wishing for it, because it’s not anything you’re doing wrong, yeah?” James sighs. “Mum and I really just left you from young and I think about that a lot now. The family and our house would have collapsed years ago if it weren’t for you looking after Dad and paying the bills, and you did all that from the heart, ’cos I know we didn’t act grateful. I could never; I don’t have that in me, man. I’m thankful for you, Mads, and I’m sorry, for … for a lot of things. For everything. But Dad loved you, you know.” “You were barely there,” I say. “How can you be sure?” “It’s like you said—he always smiled at you. When it was just me and him, he was cool, but he’d always ask, ‘Is Maddie home?’ and then not say a lot after. You made him feel safe, maybe—I don’t know. More than I did, anyway.” Hearing James say it like this makes me feel proud, comforted. All the years I spent at home weren’t for nothing. I made Dad happy in a world that likely didn’t make much sense to him. “I hope I can do better for you now, when you need help,” James says. “Help with what?” “Anything,” he says, undeterred. “See what comes up.” There’s one more pause before, “Mum told me about you going to therapy and I think it’s great, Mads. Please keep going. Especially since it’s free.” One more shoulder squeeze, then he looks at his shoes. “I … I love you, yeah?” My lip wobbles and I have to swallow to keep my voice steady. “I love you, too.” * * * When the grave is filled, we put our flowers on top. James lifts the heavy ones and won’t leave until they’re all positioned well on the uneven ground. I’m the last in the line to leave and I turn round for one more look at the mound of flower-adorned earth. “Bye, Dad,” I say. “I love you, okay?” * * * Auntie Mabel calls hours later in the evening when I’m lying on Mum’s bed alone. “What you have to remember, Baaba, is who looked after him when Mum was in Ghana and James was never in the house?” I answer, “Me.” “That’s right,” she says, “and he was grateful. No parent wants to rely on their children, but your father was so grateful to have you. Whenever I mentioned your name, I did not even finish my sentence before he would smile. You were so true about that. It is a sad day, but never forget what I said, do you hear?” “Thank you.” * * * In the living room, I trail a black bin bag
