hers. I drove over each morning to pick her up and bring her to the Airbnb and drove her back when she was ready to go to bed. That morning, I’d thrown on some clothes and stopped for doughnuts on the way to her place. While she dug into the sticky pink box, searching for a maple bar, I tidied up her living room and took Buster out to do his business. Mom had slipped and fractured her knee two days before our arrival; she was waiting to see an orthopedic surgeon, making do with a knee brace and a cane. We didn’t yet know that the break was the result of the cancer eating away at her tibia and femur, or that it would prove unmendable—as the surgeon would put it, There’s not enough healthy bone left to repair. We didn’t know that she would never walk unassisted again. We wouldn’t get her latest scan results until after New Year’s, and so we were still able to tell ourselves that we might get what her oncologist called more quality time—a phrase implying that the quality of her time would slowly leech away as her cancer advanced, until it no longer made sense to continue treatment. After I unhooked Buster’s leash and washed my hands at the kitchen sink, I asked Mom what she wanted for lunch.

My mother, a largely stationary and therefore easy subject, materialized in shot after shot, sitting on a stranger’s couch in her festive burgundy tunic and a necklace of Christmas bells. She was smiling in every picture and clearly having a wonderful time, despite the pain in her knee. I tried to pretend that this was just another holiday, telling myself that I should be happy to be spending it with both my sister and my mother. Then my husband threw up, and though he told me he thought it was only a delayed travel reaction, or something he’d eaten that disagreed with him, I began to fret about all of us catching a stomach bug and giving it to my immunocompromised mom. My children were more interested in playing with their cousin than they were in visiting with any of the adults, and chafed at our request that they spend more time playing in the living room, where my mother could watch them and enjoy their company. I felt irrationally betrayed by everyone, abandoned to face my worry and heartbreak alone—didn’t
