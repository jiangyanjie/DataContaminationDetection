his tools and carried them toward the work bench. Hap sat ramrod straight in his chair. His head was tilted as if he were listening. He had a strange expression on his face, faraway and lost. “What is it?” Vic asked. “What’s wrong?” “S-sound. What is that s-sound?” Vic listened. He didn’t hear anything. Nurse Ratched did. “It is music. Gio is playing a record in the ground house.” Hap stood abruptly, the chair banging against the wall. He moved toward the door without speaking. Before Vic could call to him, he vaulted over the edge of the railing. “I wish I could do that,” Rambo said. “It looks so cool. I’m gonna do it. No one try and stop me this time.” Vic managed to grab Rambo before he could roll toward the railing. “No.” Rambo beeped rudely. “Hey! I said not to stop me.” “You take the elevator,” Vic told him. “Just because someone else does something doesn’t mean you have to.” “How profound,” Nurse Ratched said. “I am impressed, Victor.” Later, as Vic closed down the lab for the night, he got lost in his own head. Once, when he was ten, he had suddenly become fixated on the fact that he was not an android like his father. It upset him greatly and sent him spiraling for two days. He was inconsolable. They were different, he tried to explain to Dad, even as his father said their differences did not matter. But to Victor, they did matter.

Dad had sat a few feet away from him to give him space, legs folded, hands on his knees, and said, “Victor, listen to me.” He didn’t look at his father, but he heard him. He grunted quietly in response. “We’re not the same,” Dad had said, voice gentle and soft. “But know that I was alone and sad before you came into my world. You gave me hope, Victor. It started in the tips of my toes before it rose through the rest of my body and latched firmly in my chest. It has never left. It evolved into something so much greater. And it’s because of this feeling that I can say I don’t need you to be like me. I need you to be you.” Vic hadn’t spoken. Not then. But he listened, and he never forgot. He was quiet as the elevator lowered toward the ground. He followed his friends toward the ground house, pausing in the doorway. Dad sat in his chair, a curious expression on his face. He didn’t turn to look at Vic. He was focused
