eyes peeled for onlookers, she opened the mews door, and backed out into the lane. “Mrs. Bone.” Mrs. Bone’s heart jumped. “Christ alive.” Winnie Smith was hidden in the ivy. “I beg your pardon. Did I startle you?” Winnie peered at her, her cabbage-colored dress covered in detritus from the wall. “Nobody startles me,” said Mrs. Bone, catching her breath. “What d’you want?” “I come here to collect Alice’s daily report. I thought you might wish to share your first remarks.” “Oh, it’s remarks you want, is it? Heavens, let me just fetch my magnifying glass and look at my notes.” Mrs. Bone tutted. “I’ve only been here five minutes. Give me a whole day at least.” Winnie frowned, and Mrs. Bone sighed, lowering her voice. “Look, the way I see it, I’m going to be cooped up in the kitchens, shoved up the back stairs, or locked in the attics. If I’m going to assess this place, then you need to find me a reason to get into the good part of the house.” Winnie hesitated. “I’m sure you’ll find a way,” she said. Mrs. Bone gripped Winnie’s wrist. “I’m not going to be boiled like a load of old petticoats in the laundry room. You can find the way.” Winnie shook her off. “Very well,” she said, voice hardening.

Have you got the local bobby’s name?” “What do you need that for?” asked Winnie, dubiously. “Have you got it or not?” Winnie frowned. “Not his name. But naturally I’ve kept his beat under observation.” She hesitated, then drew out a notebook from her pocket. Flipped the pages. “He comes around at these times, without fail.” She tore out the piece of paper for Mrs. Bone. “Hmm,” Mrs. Bone said, approving. “You’re on top of the detail, I’ll grant you that.” Winnie looked pleased, but made her expression grave. “You really oughtn’t to see a policeman by yourself, Mrs. Bone. Something might go seriously awry. Alice can keep an eye on the mews yard, if you like. The second you go and see him, she’ll hurry down and give you some support. Will that suit?” “Support? I don’t need support from the sewing maid.” Then Mrs. Bone pondered it. “Scrap that, she’ll be very useful. Tell her to bump into us in the yard.” Mrs. Bone waved Winnie away. “Now, clear off before they see you.” She hurried as fast as she could back across the mews yard. She was preoccupied, and so she
