good.” “Ghanaian too. I think she’s even Christian,” I add. I obviously have no idea if she is the latter, but Mum looks pleased. “Maybe she can mentor you for your future career,” she says. “Mum, I work in publishing.” “And so? Can you not keep your options open? Publishing doesn’t make you a lot of money, does it? How much does Kristine make?” “Mennim.” Mum raises her eyebrows and a wide smile breaks out across her face. We continue to converse in Twi and she corrects me where I go wrong until I can repeat it correctly. “Try and find out Kristine’s salary.” “That will be difficult.” “I bet Angelina makes more.” “Maybe.” “Maame,” she says after a while. “Yes, Ma.” “Seriously, when do you think you will marry?” I smile and look her in the eyes. “Not any time soon.” * * * When I get back to the flat, I pour myself a glass of water and sit in the kitchen, drinking it slowly. Upstairs, I untie my hair, brush my teeth and shower, standing with my head low under a cascade of hot water. When out and dressed, I sit on the floor facing the window. I stare out to the sky with my back leaning against my bed and my legs crossed. “Hi, Dad.” I wait to see if the sky changes at all and when it doesn’t, I continue. “It’s me, Maddie.

Regardless, maybe we could get to know each other a bit better; start from the beginning almost.” I clear my throat. “I’m twenty-five now, twenty-six in four months. I know your memory was slipping at the end so you couldn’t remember those kinds of things, but you’re healthy again now, that’s how heaven works, right? When Mum and I went to see you at the funeral home, your feet were no longer swollen. Can you walk on your own now, Dad? Can you run? You must feel so free. You can stretch your fingers and run laps in the clouds. “I haven’t heard you have a proper conversation in years and I know it’s because your brain wouldn’t let you. You must be talking people’s ears off now. I wish I’d recorded your voice…” I would get a tissue but I don’t want to move, so I use the back of my hand to pat my face dry. “Maybe it’s not even a physical thing up there and it’s just your weightless soul and that, for you, is just a feeling, so you’re not actually running or stretching but you are weightless. The soul thing would explain how everyone fits
