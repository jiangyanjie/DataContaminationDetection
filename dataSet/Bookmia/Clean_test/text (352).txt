sister was killed, due to your incompetence? F.P. has been around for sixteen years now.” She pointed a finger right in Ogden’s face. “How many more people have to get killed or injured before you get your act together and do your job?” “What’s going on here?” Captain Somers strode toward them. Marion stepped back, breathing heavily. Peter answered for her. “We were expressing our concern about the way this case is being handled. The bomber went after Marion tonight, and meanwhile your man Ogden here doesn’t seem to understand the seriousness of the situation.” Somers glared at Ogden. “That’s enough. Go back to headquarters.” Once Ogden had slunk away, Somers placed a hand on Marion’s shoulder. “I’m sorry we got sidetracked with the letter you brought to us.” “The letter that I told you was not from the bomber,” interjected Peter. Somers accepted the criticism with a mild nod. “What about the other witness, the usher at the Paramount?” said Marion. “If the bomber came after me, there’s a good chance he’s coming after him as well.” Somers rubbed his mouth with the back of his hand. “Right. About that. That’s why I was late getting here. I’m afraid he’s already been targeted.” “Targeted?” asked Peter. “What does that mean?” “We sent a team to his apartment in the Bronx after we got Marion’s call. His apartment had been broken into, and he’d been attacked.” “Is he all right?” asked Marion. “No. He was killed.” “Killed?” Marion shuddered. “By the bomber?” “He was hit on the head with something, possibly a hammer, and then strangled. We believe the bomber came here right after, to try to neutralize the second witness.” “ ‘Neutralize the second witness’?” repeated Marion. “You mean kill me.” “Captain!” One of the policemen working the scene approached. He carried a hammer in his gloved hand. That was what had made the clattering noise when Marion had stomped hard on the attacker’s foot. He’d dropped it and left it behind. The reality that she could have been murdered finally hit her full force. Her father would have gotten another call in the night saying his daughter had been killed. He would’ve never recovered from the shock, and it would have been all her fault for being selfish and petty-minded, pursuing her dreams at the cost of her own life. He’d been right about everything after all. The room twirled around her as she fainted to the ground. CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE DECEMBER 1992 As Piper and I approach the theater, the wet street glistens red and blue from the lights of Radio City’s marquee. Special Christmas Spectacular—Celebrating the 60th Anniversary of the Rockettes, it reads. In spite of myself, my heart lifts into my throat. This was the place that in many ways defined who I am today. Where I learned the value of good friends and hard work. I can still summon up the crazy mix of skittishness and hyper-focus that would settle upon me backstage as we waited for our cue. It falls over me now, like a shower
