there was an objection lurking somewhere, Mrs. King wanted it out in the open. Mrs. Bone put her hands behind her back, expression angelic. “Good Lord,” she said. “It’s not for me to say.” “The date?” “Any day’s a bad day for a bad job.” “The time?” “No.” Mrs. King transferred the sherbet to the other side of her mouth. “The crew?” Mrs. Bone shook her head. “No, they’re all right. Not an inch on my Janes, mind you.” “I can’t change your fee.” “Can’t you?” Another figure appeared on the pavement. Mrs. King offered the bag. “Sherbet?” Mrs. Bone batted her hand away. “You’ve got dirty fingers.” She rummaged into a jar of pear drops, drew out a fistful, shoved two in her mouth. “Go on.” “You go on.” Mrs. Bone stared at her, eyes bright, sucking hard. “I want an advance.” “You’ve got an advance.” “No, I’ve got one of Danny’s trinkets, which you stole from him, at no cost to yourself, bearing no value at all.” This was a bit rich. “It doesn’t have symbolic value?” said Mrs. King. “I chose it rather carefully.” “These aren’t the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, my girl. We aren’t in the pyramids. I ain’t painting symbols all over the walls. I don’t need gestures. You’re doing this whole job on credit. Good for you, I’d do the same. But then I’ve got decent lines. You want to spend on my account, on my good name, then I need cash up front, to cover my risks.” “Yes,” said Mrs. King, crunching her sherbet. “You do.” Mrs. Bone looked annoyed at that. “Well, then, you understand, don’t you?” she said. “I can’t be making big investments until trading gets a bit brisker.” Second move, thought Mrs. King. “Your trade’s not about to get any brisker,” she said. Mrs. Bone took another pear drop. “Says who?” “I’ve got eyes.” “And?” “I can read accounts.” There it was: a streak of anger. Startled you, didn’t I? thought Mrs. King. She felt almost sorry, prodding Mrs. Bone. Her aunt was the only person who’d ever kept an eye out for her when she was small. Gave her clean pinafores, sturdy boots, fresh stockings, when Mother couldn’t manage. But this wasn’t a time to be softhearted. “Not your accounts,” she added smoothly. “I never pry into a lady’s affairs. But I’ve paid a call on Mr. Murphy. His books are looking splendid, Mrs. Bone. Heaving with orders. Whereas all I smell around your place is a pile of old debts.” “Is that so?” Mrs. King nodded. “Debts and debtors, crawling all over your patch.” Mrs. Bone said nothing. The flesh around her neck was taut, as if she were holding her chin up with great effort, as if it were costing her dearly not to backhand Mrs. King. Then she mastered herself. Smiled, put the other pear drop into her mouth. “Shall I name the sum, dear? Or shall we bully each other till sundown?” Mrs. King crossed her arms. “You may name the sum.” Mrs. Bone did so.
