be well within their rights to turn you away, especially since you could bring down the might of the Authority upon them.” “Th-they’ll help us,” Hap said. “Ah, I see your heart has made you imprudent,” the Coachman said. “How endearing! How positively catastrophic!” His eyes narrowed as his mustache twitched. “Say, what would you think about letting me have a go at it? Just for a little while. I want to see what it would feel like to have a heart of my own. I promise I would give it back.” Hap folded his arms. “Sure.” The Coachman blinked. “Really?” Hap nodded. “C-come and t-take it if you c-can.” “I think I like my limbs as they are,” the Coachman said hastily. “You’re very possessive of it, though I don’t blame you. I would be the same way.” He looked at Vic, a sly expression on his face. “Perhaps you could make one for me. In exchange for my help, of course.” He wiggled his fingers at Vic. “Consider it recompense for putting myself on the line for you.” “You kidnapped us and put us in cages,” Nurse Ratched said. “I think getting us to the city will make us even.” “Everyone’s a critic,” the Coachman muttered. “Fine, you’ve made your point, though I am offended you consider me a kidnapper.

But worry not! I have a plan.” The image shifted dizzily, the city spinning in a circle, before enhancing. “I know certain … machines, willing to look the other way in exchange for … well.

There are backdoors into the city.” The image showed a pair of large gates, wooden, with a strip of black metal across the top. “This is where you’ll enter. Once inside, you’ll need to keep to the side streets. Nurse Ratched, how goes the download?” “Nearly complete,” Nurse Ratched said. “She’ll be able to lead you,” the Coachman said. “I’ve given her a map of the city. So long as you stick to the shadows, you should be able to make it to Heaven without much trouble.” “And that’s it?” Vic asked. “That’s it,” the Coachman said. “Simple on the surface, though rife with dangers underneath. Rambo and Nurse Ratched should be fine. Hap too, so long as his face remains hidden. Victor, your disguise is adequate, but don’t for a moment believe it’ll last if you find yourself in trouble. You can’t let them find you
