decided to toy with me?” “I’m not toying with you,” I say. “Lenora does know how to type. We spent all of yesterday doing it. She’s been telling me what happened the night her family was murdered. I think she plans on either confessing or telling me who really did it.” “That’s insane, Kit. The woman can barely sit up. Do you seriously expect me to believe that Lenora Hope is typing her goddamn life story?” “But it’s the truth!” “Sure,” Detective Vick says, dripping sarcasm. “Let’s go with that. But why now? After so many years, why has she decided to tell you, of all people, what happened that night?” “I don’t know. But she has told me things.” The words tumble out in a mad rush, so desperate am I to have Detective Vick believe me about something. “About the months leading up to the murders. About her family.

Now that I do know—and now that I’ve completely blown my chance of him ever believing me about anything—I feel compelled to ask the same questions I think he would have posed. “Did Mary tell you she was leaving?” Lenora taps once on the keyboard. “The last time you saw her, how did she act?” Lenora starts typing, stops to give it some thought, starts over. The result is a strange beast of a word. weirnervous I study the word, which is a pretty accurate summation of my own current state. “Which is it? Weird or nervous?” both, Lenora types. “Had she been acting this way for a while?” Lenora taps the keyboard twice. Yes. “Did Mary ever mention hearing strange noises at night?” She gives the keyboard two more taps. Another yes. I’m hit
