… the words vanished within her. She held up her handful of letters. And she said, “You.” Roman was silent for a beat. He drew a deep breath and whispered, “Me.” Iris smiled, a shield for how mortified she was. She felt like laughing and crying, but she forced them both down. Her head began to ache. “All this time, you were receiving my letters?” “Yes,” Roman replied. “I just … I can’t believe this, Kitt!” “Why? What’s so hard to believe, Iris?” “All this time it was you.” She blinked away her tears and tossed one of the letters onto Roman’s bed. It was satisfying, to hear the paper crinkle, a distraction from her embarrassment. She dropped another page, and then another. The letters fell onto his lap. “Stop it, Iris,” Roman said, gathering them up as they drifted. As she carelessly crinkled them. “I understand why you’re angry at me, but let me expl—” “How long have you known?” she asked tersely. “When did you know it was me?” Roman paused, his jaw clenched. He continued to gently gather her letters. “I knew from the beginning.” “The beginning?” “From the first letter you sent,” he amended. “You didn’t mention your name, but you talked about your job at the Gazette, the columnist position.” Iris froze in horror, listening to him.
