admiration of the scientific community—and while she might not be who I am, she’s who I want to be. Too bad that her existence is antithetical to this other guy’s. “Jonathan Smith-Turner.” Dr. L.’s mouth is a thin line. His eyes, hurt. “A disgrace.” I nod. “The likes of him taint physics and academia.” I nod again. “It is apparent what needs to be done.” More nodding, in full agreement. “Clearly, you must withdraw your application.” Hang on. Maybe not full agreement. “Withdraw . . . my application?” “I cannot allow you to work in the same department as that animal.” “But I . . .” I squirm and lean forward in the chair. So much for elegance and poise. “I need the job.” “You have a job.” “I cannot adjunct for one more year.” “But you are an adjunct professor. You should be proud of your current employment.” Throughout my Ph.D., I expected to graduate and then move on to a research-only position. Those tend to come with better pay than adjuncts, health insurance, and a blessedly low number of student emails claiming the sixth grandparent’s death of the semester. As someone with . . . whatever the opposite of a calling for teaching is, it seemed like a no-brainer. My passion, my joy, my talent—they all fit into three simple words: two-dimensional liquid crystals. Laurendeau was against it, saying that research-only positions are not prestigious enough. I initially disagreed (who cares about prestige if I can do what I love and purchase pancreatic hormones?) and for a while worried that he wouldn’t help me find the kind of job I wanted. Professorships aside, most academic postings are not advertised online, but obtained through professional networks of peers and advisors. In the end, it didn’t turn out to be an issue: Dr. L. said that he respected my wishes and reached out widely to all his colleagues to let it be known that I was looking for a research position. Not one person was interested in hiring me. And when no tenure-track professorship was available, either . . . “I used my connections to find you your current jobs, Elise,” he tells me, eyes full of concern. “Are you having issues with them?” I’m instantly swimming in guilt. Dr. L. pulled strings. He called up old colleagues—reached out to people who turned their backs to him after the Smith-Turner censure. Swallowed his pride for me. “No! The commute between different campuses is time consuming, but . . .” I start biting into my cuticles, then remember that I stopped three years ago. With the help of Cece and a spray bottle. “But nice. The variety.” I smile. He smiles back, pleased, and I feel a heady sense of relief and affection. Dr. L. is my one ally in the Red Riding Hood forest of academia. If it weren’t for him, I’d never have gotten into grad school to begin with. My heart squeezes as I remember senior year of college. My low grades. My mediocre GRE scores blinking on the screen,
