in formal robes stand lined against the walls. In front of us on a raised platform are two thrones, one of which is occupied. The emperor… Miss Zhao and I are pushed forward. When the man holding my shoulder lets go, I drop to the ground—Miss Zhao beside me—in total submission. “I have striven to make the palace a place of good thought and proper acts.” The emperor’s voice is not at all what I might have imagined, if I’d ever given a moment’s thought to it. He sounds like a regular man—like my husband or my grandfather—only the words he forms with his ordinary voice make my body shiver. “I have but one wife. Empress Zhang is the moon to my sun. One day long from now she will become the empress dowager, helping our son as he rules China. But you”—he lifts a finger to gesture at Meiling—“have offended her eyes with your vile act. I am outraged on behalf of the empress, who had to witness such pollution in the Great Within.” Meiling soundlessly weeps. “I have discussed the offense with my counselors at the Board of Punishments, as well as with those who oversee the Lodge of Ritual and Ceremony,” the emperor continues. “Together they have recommended that the offending party be immediately put to death.

I pray that it works. “The midwife put the birth of the next emperor above the safety of herself and her child,” the empress says. “What does this matter when she insulted your eyes?” “I beg you to show benevolence.” The emperor is not swayed. “I have made my decision.” Empress Zhang gestures to the line of women before her. “Each one of us implores you—” With those words spoken, I find my courage. “I would like to say a few words on the midwife’s behalf.” The emperor looks startled. Some of the men in their grand robes grumble their displeasure. “Empress Zhang truly is the Compassionate One,” I say. “And you are the
