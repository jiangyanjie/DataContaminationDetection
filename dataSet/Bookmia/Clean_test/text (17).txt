not even half. We’re agog with it.” Miss de Vries’s face was immobile. “Have I said something amiss?” Hephzibah patted her on the hand. “Don’t fret. It’s a new century, dear. We’re all ripe for a shake-up. And you needn’t stand on ceremony about HRH. She’s slipping down the pecking order every year, poor thing. One day you’ll be able to drag her to any old bazaar or rose sale you like. I can’t see her making any great marriage, can you?” Hephzibah shifted in her seat. “But for now, of course, things are managed terribly, particularly in her household.” “Of course.” “It’s the question of security that really gets us all stirred up. We are living in such awfully violent times. Now, if you wanted to secure the royal presence, I would have to assure the household that there would be exceptional care taken for Her Royal Highness’s safety.” Only Miss de Vries’s knuckles, the faintest cracking of the skin, betrayed her interest. “Of course,” she said. “She does not, you understand, go out in society a great deal.” “I hear she’s very close to the queen.” “Quite right,” said Hephzibah severely, “and we forget, all too often, they are first and foremost a family. The first family in the land, bound as tightly in blood and bond as any—” she paused, casting around for the right words “—tradesman and his daughter.” Miss de Vries took this flank attack with a thin smile. “Indeed.” “So her safety is of paramount importance. We have our own policemen at the palace, you understand.” The moment stretched, longer and longer. And then, at last, Miss de Vries said, “They should feel free to look around, if it would help things.” “Thank you,” said Hephzibah, setting her cup down with a clatter. “If a few of your people clear out, give them a few rooms to stay in, then I am sure that would suffice.” Miss de Vries looked uncertain. “You mean...” “On the night of your party. We would want our own men in the house.” Miss de Vries laid down her cup. “Is it likely that the princess will attend, Your Grace?” Hephzibah drew on the strength of all duchesses past and present, the specters of great ladies living and dead. She sat up straight and said, “Miss de Vries. I would no more presume to predict the movements of Her Royal Highness than to divine the direction of the winds. But I am willing to put in a word, if you’re able to oblige me.” Miss de Vries’s gaze narrowed, suspicious. “If I can, Your Grace.” Hephzibah smiled. “It’s quite remarkable, the expenses people incur, ferrying Their Royal Highnesses from one engagement to another. If there’s anything that can be done to ease the burden for us...” Miss de Vries’s face closed, as if she’d disappeared behind a screen. “She’ll hate it,” Mrs. King had said, “being treated like a piggy bank. It’s everything she despises. But she’ll need to see a sign of weakness. She needs to feel she’s in control.”
