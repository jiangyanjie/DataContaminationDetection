nice couple we made. Maybe a kiss at the end of the night.” She paused. “At one point, he excused himself to go to the bathroom. When he didn’t come back after a while, I went upstairs and found him staring into your room through your cracked door. Watching you as you changed clothes.” Marion involuntarily crossed her arms over her chest, as if the boy were there now. “That’s awful.” “He ran out of the house when I caught him, and then I resigned from the math club for good. I don’t know why I even bothered.” “It’s not your fault, what happened.” Marion wished she could throttle Stan. At the same time, she was amazed and gratified that Judy would have asked for her advice on a prom gown. “He’s the one who should have resigned, not you.” “For a long time, I thought it was your fault.” “He was a creep. There are plenty of them out there.” She was thinking of Dale. “But they’re not all like that. Dad’s not like that.” Judy looked up at the city skyline to the south, which rose high above the tree branches. “There’s something going on with him.” “With Dad? What do you mean?” “I know what he does every second of every day, practically, but sometimes he goes off to these appointments that aren’t in the calendar. Hours that are not accounted for. He’s slipping off to do something, and I’m not sure what it is.” How strange. “Do you think he’s seeing someone?” While their father had been pursued by several women he’d encountered over the years—at the tennis club, or when they were all out to dinner, ladies who were obviously smitten by his mix of charm and gruffness—he’d never followed up. “It’s the only thing I can think of. But why would he hide it?” Judy checked her watch. “I have to go.” “Already?” “I have to get back downtown.” “Well, I loved seeing you,” said Marion, and she meant it. Something about Judy brought her back to earth, reminded her that she was solid and safe. To her surprise, Judy leaned in and gave her a hug. Marion remembered when they were little girls and would fling themselves into each other’s arms over the silliest things: the promise of ice cream after dinner, the radio announcing a snow day for the school district. They stood there, embracing in the cold wind, and Judy murmured in her ear, “I’ll come to see you.” “You will?” Marion almost fell in her surprise, her skate sliding out from under her, but Judy caught her right in time and they both laughed. “Next Thursday is the opening day for the Christmas Spectacular. I’ll leave a ticket for you for the six-o’clock show. Is that all right? You’ll come?” Judy gave a quick nod. “I’ll be there.” CHAPTER THIRTEEN The first two shows of the Christmas Spectacular went by in a whirlwind for Marion, and while she adored the applause and the smiling faces of the children who waited for autographs
