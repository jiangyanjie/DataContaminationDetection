missed. For months now, we’ve gotten nothing but terrible news, but at least until the pandemic we were able to see each other. I thought we would get more visits, more time together—the time I didn’t get with Dad. I thought I’d be beside her when she died. Now I don’t know if I will ever see her again. 19 Things I send to my mother while she is dying Letters and cards Flowers Watercolor artwork and comics drawn by my kids A small Christmas tree in a ceramic pot, with decorations All the good Jane Austen film adaptations I can find on DVD that she doesn’t already own The complete Slings & Arrows The complete Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries The complete Poirot All the Harriet Vane/Peter Wimsey novels Most of Helen Mirren’s film oeuvre A new tablet to replace her old one, with Skype preinstalled An Oregon sunstone necklace Warm socks Nice hand lotion Good coffee Chicken soup and rolls Pears Chocolate babka Chocolate-chip cookies Mother’s Day tulips A new knee brace 20 I know, on days when she gets angry, that she is not really angry with me. She is grieving for her mother. She is grieving for herself. Despite her faith in God’s mercy, the existence of heaven, the promise of seeing my father again, she wants to live. She still has some good days, but she has more and more hard ones. One night, she has a fall that leaves her with a bruise on her forehead, and when I call her, she sounds confused and furious. I don’t understand what’s wrong with me. I don’t know why this is happening. Soon, she can’t text or write emails anymore. The very last text she sends me, in mid-April, is about her plan to visit my grandmother’s grave. The last email is a couple of lines asking what the kids might want for Easter, because she’s determined to keep sending them gifts and treats. From then on, we have only phone calls or video calls. But they’re not always easy to coordinate, and sometimes she cannot easily follow the conversation; it’s the brain tumor, her nurse tells me, as well as the pain medication. I want her to have something tangible, something she can hold on to, so I write her a letter—on lighthouse stationery, because it makes me think of all the weekends we spent together on the Oregon coast. Beach trips with my grandmother were always busy, packed with crabbing and clamming, shopping and bike rides, fishing in the bay, card games all evening. Trips with my mom were quiet and slow, consisting of long walks by the ocean and greasy diner meals and a visit to our favorite lighthouse, where a hundred-mile-long river flowed into the bay. The lighthouse gift shop was her favorite, which is why I have T-shirts, salt and pepper shakers, place mats, pencils, and refrigerator magnets all adorned with lighthouses. She is probably the one who sent me the stationery. I fill several sheets of paper, telling her how much we miss
