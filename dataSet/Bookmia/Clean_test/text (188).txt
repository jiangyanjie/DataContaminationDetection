has Kitt been here?” Iris had asked. “Almost a month,” Sarah had replied. “So don’t worry about him having seniority. I think you both have a fair shot at the promotion.” “And what does his family do?” “His grandfather pioneered the railroad.” “So his family has money.” “Heaps,” Sarah said. “Where did he go to school?” “I think Devan Hall, but don’t quote me on that.” A prestigious school where most of the rich parents of Oath sent their spoiled brats. A direct contrast to Iris’s humble Windy Grove. She had almost winced at this revelation, but pressed on with “Is he courting anyone?” “Not that I know of,” Sarah had answered with a shrug. “But he doesn’t share much about his life with us. In fact, I don’t really know that much about him, other than he doesn’t like anyone touching the things on his desk.” Partly satiated with her newfound knowledge, Iris had decided the best course of action was to ignore her competition. She could pretend he didn’t exist most of the time. But she soon discovered that would be increasingly difficult as they had to race each other to the bulletin board for weekly assignments. She had triumphantly snagged the first one. Roman had then obtained the second, but only because she had let him. It had given her the chance to read a published article of his. Iris had sat hunched at her desk, reading what Roman had written about a retired baseball player—a sport Iris had never cared about but suddenly found herself ensorcelled by, all due to the poignant and witty tone of Roman’s writing.

And because she was desperate for something to distract her from her mortification, she noticed his name, printed in small black type beneath the column headline. ROMAN C. KITT “What does the C stand for?” she asked, glancing up at him. He had only lifted his cup of tea and taken a sip, refusing to reply. But he held her gaze over the chipped edge of the porcelain. “Roman Cheeky Kitt?” Iris had guessed. “Or maybe Roman Churlish Kitt?” His amusement dimmed. He didn’t like to be made fun of, and Iris’s grin broadened as she leaned back in her chair. “Or perhaps it’s Roman Cantankerous Kitt?” He had turned and left without another word, but his jaw had been clenched. Once he was gone, she had finished reading his article in peace. It made her heart ache—his writing was extraordinary—and she had dreamt about him that night. The next morning, she had promptly torn the paper to shreds and vowed to never read another one of his pieces again. If she
