accept the inevitable, is why he didn’t see fit to tell us. Or maybe, my mother later theorized, laughing and crying at once, he wanted to spare us the knowledge: It might have been the one truly noble act of his life. By then, I was afraid of losing her, too. I didn’t know what to believe. I still don’t know what I want to believe. In my memory, my father wasn’t prone to hiding the truth in order to comfort others. But neither was he prone to visions. Was it really there, the ladder he saw that day, propped up against the snowcapped summit? Of course it wasn’t. I am sure that he imagined it. But I can’t claim to know what it means that he did. 10 Grief comes in waves, everyone says. After my father’s death, I kept waiting to be buffeted, swept under. I was sure that his loss was all I would be able to feel once the shock began to ebb. In the days leading up to his funeral, I carried the knowledge that he was gone in my tight chest, my aching throat, my stomach that felt as though I’d swallowed a riverbed’s worth of stones. I both feared and hoped that traveling home, seeing my mother, would allow my grief to flow more freely.

Though Dan did his best to manage them, trying to spare me further strain, I was aware every time the kids fussed or fought, wavering between vexation and worry. It wasn’t their fault, I tried to tell myself—how were they supposed to know what to do with death at their ages? I was nearly a decade into parenting; I should be accustomed to putting aside my own feelings and needs when necessary. But the sight of my mother trying to cheer up her cranky grandchildren the night before she buried her husband made me feel raw and resentful, and I began to wish that I had left the rest of my family at home. At least then I would have been able to focus on my mother, and she wouldn’t be forced to placate my children instead of attending to her own grief. I texted my friends: There is no room at all for my feelings with the kids here. They were all sympathetic, but they reminded me that it was important for my children to be there. Even if they weren’t super close to your dad, it’s their first experience with death. They need to be able to witness it and say goodbye. I knew
