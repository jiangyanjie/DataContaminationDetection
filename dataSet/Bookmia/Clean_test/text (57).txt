that.” Porter makes a note on a little pad of paper he keeps in his pocket. I smile. Besides the fact that I like Porter as a person, he’s probably the best hire we’ve ever made. He made a point to study the camp inside and out, especially the trails, and he knows them better than any of us, which is helpful when you’re trying to organize a game that takes place over all the acreage the camp sits on. Porter and I finish up our check of the hatch and head to the office by the main entrance. As we pass Mirror Lake, I catch a glimpse of Tasha standing on the dock, peering down into the water. She’s holding the pool skimmer we use to fish dead animals out of the lake. “Tasha!” I yell. “You good?” She glances back and grins. “Yeah! Just thought I heard something. Thought it was a opossum or something that fell in.” “Is it?” I ask. “Can you tell?” I recall hearing the splash in the lake, and now I’m worried we’re gonna have a bunch of dead forest animals bobbing in the murky water. “Not really,” she says. “It’s hard to see, though. I think there’s something down there, but the skimmer’s too short. Poor thing, whatever it is.” She shakes her head, then catches a glimpse of Porter. “I see you, Porter! Your little hoochie-daddy shorts are real cute! You looking for a boyfriend out in these woods?” Porter sticks out his leg, flexes his chiseled thigh, and grins. “I was tryna get Javier, but I think he’s still stuck on you,” Porter calls back. Tasha laughs. She and Javier have been flirting so much, it’s actually a little annoying. Like, hook up or knock it off. As I scan the rocky shore of Mirror Lake, I catch a glimpse of something reflecting the early-morning sun. I jog over and scoop it up. It’s a key chain with two keys attached and a little chain that says, Town of Groton, Estd. 1817, in flaking white letters. Porter joins me and peers over my shoulder. “More keys?” I nod and shove them in my pocket. Porter and I go into the main office to find a group of four people crowding the desk as a bewildered-looking Kyle flips through the reservation book while seated on a low stool. “I just—what was your name again?” he asks, clearly flustered. One girl with a long, dark braid down her back rolls her eyes and sticks out her neck. “Kennedy. K-E-N-N—” “I know how to spell it,” Kyle says. “Thanks.” I slide behind the desk and gently take the reservation book from him. He squeezes my shoulder and pushes the stool back from the counter. He starts to stand up, but I gently push him back down. He gives me a nod, and I turn my attention back to the woman on the other side of the desk. “Reservation for Kennedy,” I say, finding the name scrawled halfway down the page. “Four players. You’ll be at
