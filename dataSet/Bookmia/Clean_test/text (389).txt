whose fault is that?” “You just have to blame me for everything.” “I don’t blame you for everything. You actually do everything.” But she leaned in. “Your persecution complex is unreal.” “I don’t have a persecution complex!” I said. “I am literally being persecuted.” “It’s not my fault your mother died,” Parker said then. “It’s not my fault your dad married my mom. It’s not my fault we sold our house, and I gave up my room, and we got thrown together every minute of every day. I didn’t ask for that, and I certainly didn’t ask for you. I was not consulted—about any of it! And yes, I did all those terrible things! I framed you and lied about you and coaxed them both into pushing you away. But your dad not loving you? That’s not my fault, either. He stopped loving you well before we met. You lost him all on your own. And you want to know how you did that? Because you”—and here she seemed to rise up on her dragon haunches—“are the reason that your mother died.” I guess our voices had accidentally gotten loud. When she stopped talking, there was not a sound in the gallery. I could hear the A/C dripping into my bucket. I could hear a toilet flush. And I could hear all those people who’d been ignoring me earlier suddenly taking a new kind of interest. I lowered my voice, in a comical shot at privacy. “What are you talking about right now?” “I overheard them talking one night—Dad and Lucinda. He told her what happened.

She went anyway. And then one week later, she collapsed.” What was she saying? I felt a weird pain in my chest, like the shell of my heart was cracking. “That’s what he said that night,” Parker went on. “That it was your fault. That try as he might, he couldn’t help but blame you. I heard him say those words out loud. So you can stop thinking I ruined your relationship with your father. It’s not my fault he doesn’t love you. It’s not my fault you lost your family. You did all that to yourself.” Was something going on with the floor? It felt like the room was shaking. So much for staying until the end. I looked up for an escape route, and that’s when I saw my father. I knew it was him at a glance from that navy polka-dot bowtie he’d been wearing to fancy events ever since I was little. And I’d know his stance—not to mention his outline—anywhere. And there he stood, a forgotten bouquet of grocery store flowers in his
