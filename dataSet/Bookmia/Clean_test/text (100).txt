may never know all the reasons why he didn’t feel more open to receiving a donated kidney, whether from a family member or from a stranger. Though I’ve often wished that we could have come up with an argument that would have changed his mind, my mother believed nothing either of us could say would have swayed him. She said that he remembered his mother’s agony after organ rejection, and in the end he believed that neither dialysis nor a transplant would give him a long life. The dialysis did its job, as it had for his mother, first saving and then extending his life. But the ongoing treatments left him drained and far more vulnerable to other illnesses and infections. His immune system was compromised; he was constantly getting sick. We knew that he wasn’t thriving, nor was he improving. He was enduring. * * * He had been on dialysis for four and a half years when he began experiencing balance problems, head and neck pain, difficulty walking. After two painful falls and a high fever, he finally made an appointment with his doctor. An MRI showed an aggressive case of osteomyelitis, a bone infection, in his vertebrae, which was putting pressure on his neck and attacking his spinal cord. The doctor wasn’t certain where it had come from; while the area around his dialysis port was vulnerable to infection, it appeared to be clear. His best guess was that the bacterial attack might have started in the teeth and gums, where my father was prone to abscesses and infections. Both diabetes and dialysis increased his risk of dental problems, and he had rarely had access to comprehensive dental coverage. My father was referred to a neurosurgeon, who performed surgery within hours. “If you wait even one more day, you’re risking paralysis or spinal stroke,” he told my parents. He removed a badly inflamed spinal disk and several damaged vertebrae, putting in plates and screws where necessary. The operation was successful, but when Dad woke up in the recovery area, he kept clearing his throat, insisting he “could feel something down there.” Soon his trachea was so swollen from the infection and the trauma of the operation that he needed to be intubated and moved to the ICU. All of this happened so quickly that my mother had no time to update me. By the time she could call, the swelling had gone down, and Dad was off the ventilator and breathing on his own again. She agreed that we should try to come out and visit soon, but advised us to wait until he came home from the hospital. “There’d be nothing for you to do right now,” she said, sounding impossibly weary. When I was able to talk to Dad, I spent most of the call in tears, apologizing for not being closer. It was still hard for him to speak. He tried to tell me that it was all right, he was getting the care he needed, and he knew that I was praying for him and
