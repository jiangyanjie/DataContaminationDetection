screen, causing it to fold back up. Once done, he moved that one too. “How far are we from Heaven?” Vic asked, looking back at Nurse Ratched. Her screen filled with another map. Multiple squares appeared, which Vic knew meant buildings. A line ran from one square—the warehouse—and turned right, then left, then right once more before it ended at another square. “Approximately a mile. The Coachman provided me the best route in order to get to Heaven and stay out of sight. If he is correct and we do not run into any issues, we should arrive in twenty-six minutes. According to the Coachman, the Authority increases their patrols after dark. While night will provide us additional cover, the risk will be greater.” “Suggestion?” Vic asked. “We move now. Heaven is located in the lower quarters of the city. Per the Coachman, the lower quarters are not as well kept as the rest of the city. We will fit in so long as we do not draw attention to ourselves.” She turned toward Rambo. “Which means that you cannot roll off if you see another vacuum.” “But—” “We will leave you behind.” “You would?” Rambo said. “Fine. I promise I won’t roll off if I see one of my relatives because you guys don’t care about my feelings.” “That is correct,” Nurse Ratched said. “Hey!” Hap stood next to Vic as he studied the map on Nurse Ratched’s screen. “S-seems easy enough.” “It does,” Nurse Ratched said. “Which is why we need to be careful. We are close to our goal.

They all turned slowly to look at him. He scowled. “What? That’s what you s-say.” “Wow,” Rambo whispered fervently. “One of us! One of us!” Hap rolled his eyes. “Shut up. I am n-not.” He turned to head toward the door, but Vic stopped him by grabbing his arm. He looked down at Vic’s hand, then up at his face, asking a question without speaking. Vic let his arm go, reaching up and pulling his hood back over his head. “One of us.” Hap looked like he was about to argue but shook his head instead. Then he adjusted Vic’s helmet until it was no longer crooked. “There are w-worse th-things I c-can be.” Vic grinned at him. It felt odd to be smiling at such a time, but he couldn’t stop it if he’d tried. And wonder of all wonders, Hap smiled back. It was small, the edges twitching, but there. “Oh boy,” Nurse Ratched said. “If I had known all it would take would be to lock the two of you in a small enclosed space, I would
