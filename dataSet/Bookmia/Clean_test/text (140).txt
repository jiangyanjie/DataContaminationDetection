on him. Mother’s strict about things like this. We don’t want any taint on the family, no suggestion we’re covering anything up.” He gave her a fast look. “We’ve all heard rumors about your father’s funny business. Somebody should go to the police.” Miss de Vries turned, clutching the side of the carriage. “Why on earth,” she said, “would you want to do that?” “It’s my duty,” he said smoothly, “as a Christian.” He arrowed the carriage into the park, hurtling over rough ground. “I expect Lockwood’ll come and tell you the rest himself. We’ve torn up the contract. With you, that is.” He braked, hard, and Miss de Vries felt her stomach jolting. He turned, expression as flat as she could make her own. “Thought I’d do the decent thing and tell you myself.” * * * Lockwood was waiting for her in the front hall. He hadn’t removed his gloves. “Miss de Vries, I regret to tell you, I think I must withdraw my counsel.” She wanted to press her thumbs into his throat, stop him from breathing. She knew she could do it. “You’ll survive,” she said, “won’t you? You loathsome little cockroach.” Lockwood grimaced and raised a hand, silencing her. “Ah, Shepherd.” A door had opened.

It hit the marble with a gentle clang, skidding past Shepherd’s feet. “Fetch,” she said, with disdain. This wasn’t over, she promised herself, hands shaking. This wasn’t the end. 40 The day after the ball That night the women had a feast. Not in Tilney Street, but in the docks, in Mrs. Bone’s inventions room, cuckoo clocks hooting at them every hour. There was a queer energy to the air. The first proceeds were already coming in, rushing like dark water through underground tunnels. They came faster than Mrs. Bone could tally them, orders running like wildfire back and forth across the wires, steamer routes, trains, the express—to Paris, Marseille, Kristiania, Venice, Prague. Mrs. Bone had ordered game pie, and boned capon, and cutlets and peas, and chicken in aspic. She gave them melon and green figs, and ribbon jelly, and an amber-colored sponge cake at least a foot high. There were candied oranges and a dish with ices, and a basket of greengages and meringues. “Too much,” said Hephzibah, clutching her stomach. “I thought you were a skinflint, Mrs. Bone.” “I can get more,” said Mrs. Bone, eyes
