like that. I’m not trying to romance her. I love her. She loves me. She’s just not ready yet. She’ll come to it in time.” This stupid fucker is so far out of his league he has no idea the height of the wall. “You should have taken her to an old movie. The Marx Brothers, maybe.” He stares at me. Figure he genuinely has no idea why the fuck I would say something like that. He looks almost grateful. “Does she—does she like the Marx Brothers? Did she say that to you when you saw her?” “Yeah. She loves the Marx Brothers, and she talks to bears.” He winces. He knows about the bears. “She not well, Maurice?” “She’s fine.” “I’m not sure she is. Athena doesn’t think so.” “Athena has no idea. She’s hardly ever there. She just waltzes in, like a teenager. I’m surprised she doesn’t bring her laundry.” “Bit of a problem for you if Elaine gets another dose, isn’t it? You’re not due for decades. She’ll overmatch you.” In her bed, not that he’s ever going there. I’d put money down he’s wrong about her. “Hardly your business, Sounder.” “Man, you were happy with the Marx Brothers thing, when you thought I had the inside track. Maybe I’m just looking out for you.” Doublewide chuckles. I ignore him. “Afforestation chat. All night, was it?” “Yes. All evening, anyway.” “What time did you get home?” “I’m not sure.

Court would probably not be hugely impressed, whoever she used to be married to. But Maurice doesn’t see the problem. Can’t see it. So: “Because it forms part of a criminal investigation I’m undertaking officially on behalf of the police, Maurice.” Priscilla the driver-cook comes back. I wonder if she’s brought sundaes, but she hasn’t. Doublewide raises his eyebrows at her. “Maurice Tonfamecasca is right this second en route to Syros,” she says. “I spoke to his PA.” “Well, now,” I look back at Maurice. “Well, now. First you better tell me about Peter and Lillian, and then anything else I want to know that Stefan might be keeping from me, and then you and Mr. Nugent will have to work out how to reassure him that you won’t blab. Otherwise it seems to me you’ll never come back from Greece, on account of being eaten by pigs right here. Stefan will look for you for a while, but not for ever.” I shrug, and let the truth of that sink in. “Stefan takes pride in not really giving a shit, doesn’t he? In outliving everything, even his own emotional attachments. Assuming he ever liked you in the first place. Do you think he likes you, Maurice? Because he gave me to understand he did not. Like I think it’s possible he likes you even less than he likes me, and he really does not like me.” Maurice won’t look at me. Yeah, he knows what Stefan
