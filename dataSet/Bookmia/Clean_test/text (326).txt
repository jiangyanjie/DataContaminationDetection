be patient. And I will work with you to teach you some coping skills in the meantime.” I let out a long breath. “Can I still go home tomorrow?” “Of course,” Dr. Estrera said. “Your site is healing beautifully. There’s no reason for you to remain here.” My dad had been worryingly silent. I took a minute to note the unexpected high I’d been getting from being an accidental brain surgery poster child—a sudden minor celebrity in his world. But then, when he shook Dr. Estrera’s hand and left the room without a word to me, that high dropped to the ground. Looked like it was time to be a disappointment again. Oh well. * * * THE MOMENT OF truth came later, after most of the doctors, including my dad, had left. Dr. Nicole stayed to run me through some face recognition tests. Before we got started, I needed to pee. Which meant going to the bathroom. Which, of course, had a mirror above the sink. I avoided looking as I walked in, but as I headed out, I paused. What would happen if I looked into that mirror? What would I see? Don’t look, I told myself.

I’m faceless.” But Dr. Nicole wasn’t giving in to my drama. “You’re not faceless,” she said, steering me gently by the shoulders back to bed, “you just have edema.” I wanted to be practical about it. Matter-of-fact. I wanted to fully understand that this was just a little brain glitch. But there was nothing matter-of-fact about it. I walked away from that mirror feeling … lonely. No matter how alone you ever are in life, you always have yourself, right? You always have that goofy, imperfect face that forgets to take off its mascara before bed and wakes up with raccoon eyes. That one crooked lower tooth that the orthodontist never could manhandle into place. Those ears that stick out a little too far. Those lines on either side of your smile that always look like parentheses. That slight dimple at your chin that’s just like your mom’s. Of course those
