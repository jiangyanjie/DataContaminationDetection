had time to build more, so there’d be no climbing today. Maybe they’d still be salvageable. It’d be a pain to find them, but if they hadn’t been crushed, their batteries should have drained enough for them to beep in warning. “We’re going back?” Rambo asked, sounding incredulous. “But we almost died!” “No risk, no reward,” Vic told him as he spooled thick and fibrous rope, storing it inside Nurse Ratched. “The reward is staying functional.” He paused. “Do robots go to heaven?” Vic blinked, thrown off-kilter by the conversational whiplash. “What? Where did you—” He stopped. “Top Hat.” A film that Rambo was enamored with, even though the disc was degraded so much that the screen skipped and jumped more than it stood still. A man and woman danced cheek to cheek, singing about how they were in heaven. “I don’t know, Rambo. I don’t even know if heaven exists.” “Oh. Why not?” “Because it’s just a story.” “So what happens when we stop functioning?” “I don’t know that either.” “I could assist you in that regard,” Nurse Ratched said. “There would be minimal screaming involved.” “We’re not killing anyone today,” Vic told her. “Tell that to the squirrel,” Nurse Ratched said. “Oh. Wait. You cannot. Because it is dead.” “Oh no,” Rambo whispered. “What happened to the farm?” “I lied,” Nurse Ratched said. “I killed it by rolling over it again and again. I only left enough for stew for Vic. Is that not fun? I am having fun.” Vic led them to a different entry point to the Scrap Yards in case the Old Ones were still stalking about the area they’d been in last. The Scrap Yards stretched miles in every direction. Vic hadn’t explored every bit of it, but he and his father had mapped as much as they could. He stopped on the edge of the forest where grass yielded to dirt and metal. The nearest Old One looked to be a quarter of a mile away. They were in luck. “Nurse Ratched,” Vic said. “Pull up the grid. Focus on 3B.” Her screen filled with green lines overlaying a rudimentary map of the Scrap Yards. It’d taken years to get as much of the map filled as they had, divided up into quadrants. The far corner of the map was dark. They’d never gotten that far, though not for lack of trying. The camming devices they’d had to abandon the week before were in quadrant 6A. The Old Ones had seemed to be dumping new material around 3B. If they were lucky, they wouldn’t need camming devices as the piles wouldn’t be too high yet, so they could start there and then swing down to 6A on their way home to check and see if anything could be salvaged. He studied the map as Nurse Ratched enhanced 3B and made a plan. Absentmindedly nudging his foot against Rambo, Vic said, “All right. What are the rules?” “Stick together!” Rambo said. “Run if we have to,” Nurse Ratched said as the map disappeared. “No dallying!” “No
