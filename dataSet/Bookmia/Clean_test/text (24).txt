it.” The HARP looked at the others. Vic kept his gaze down, his helmet falling forward slightly. “And it wasn’t because of them?” “N-no. It was a f-fourth.” “And what happened to the fourth?” “D-destroyed,” Hap said. “Good. We must keep the peace, after all.” He pushed by Hap, stopping in front of Nurse Ratched and Rambo. Vic prayed Rambo would keep quiet as Hap shook his head in warning behind the HARP. “Dissidents. They don’t look like much.” “They aren’t,” Hap said. “Their p-programming was altered.” “By whom?” “I d-do not know.” The HARP tapped Nurse Ratched’s screen. “You. Nursing model. Who altered your programming?” Hap took a step forward. “I’ve administered a m-memory wipe of the offending p-p-programs. They c-can’t answer you.” The HARP’s eyes narrowed slightly, but he didn’t turn around. “Why would you do that? We cannot find out who they belong to.” “Th-they started a self-d-destruct sequence when I c-cornered them. I made the d-decision to preserve what I c-could. I am b-bringing them to Creation to s-see if anything c-can be recovered.” “No sense of self-preservation,” the HARP said, standing upright. “Pity, though expected. If the memories can be recovered, it might finally lead us back to the source. You know the source of which I speak, brother?” Hap nodded. “The Blue F-Fairy.” “Yes. They have managed to cover their tracks for far longer than expected. Why we have not been given orders to raze the pyramid to the ground is beyond me. I don’t question the minds of our mothers and fathers, but I do wonder what purpose they see in allowing that place to exist.” He grabbed one of Rambo’s arms, tugging on it. Rambo stayed silent. The HARP let him go before looking at Vic. “And this one? I have never seen such a model before. How distasteful. It looks as if it were constructed from parts that do not belong together. An abomination.” “That is m-my thinking, brother,” Hap said quickly. “It will be ddissected. Creation will glean what th-they can from it.” “Machine,” the HARP said, “look at me.” Vic lifted his head. He kept his expression blank, his mouth a thin line. He let his gaze slide unfocused even as the HARP was inches away from his own face. No, this wasn’t like Hap at all, even with what Vic had seen from Hap’s memories. The HARP flicked his helmet, causing it to jar on Vic’s head. He didn’t wince as it dug into his skull, the dull clang echoing in the hall around them. “This one,” the HARP said. “This one is … different.” The HARP didn’t blink as he studied Vic’s face. “How lifelike it is. And it appears to be leaking.” A trickle of sweat dripped down Vic’s cheek like a tear. The HARP reached for it. “Y-yes,” Hap said. “It is. A m-malfunction. Do not t-touch it. I b-believe it is acidic.” The HARP pulled his hand away as he turned from Vic toward Hap. “I would like to know what Creation discovers. If this is
