* * * — Back in the day, Victor’s was a vaudeville theatre, all red velvet and gold and a high ceiling with satyrs chasing nymphs around a lake of wine. When Victor bought it she kept the style but retrofitted a series of platforms into the seating, so that the whole place starts in the gods and falls down an endless stair to the dance floor. What used to be the director’s box is now a dais with a Last Supper table and a bridge made of actual obsidian called the Stairway, blocked by a single velvet rope, which dancers of particular talent and desirability may be offered the right to ascend. Some of those who go up think they’re going to meet a soulmate, a lost heart bewildered by new youth. They watch too many movies and think they’ll be the one to teach an ancient innocent in a college kid body all about what it is to be young today. Others are just looking for the wildest time there is. I don’t know who’s at the Last Supper table tonight. Not unless it’s a woman named Susan Green. I slip through the tables to the bar and pick a seat with a view of the doors. Victor catches sight of me and rolls her eyes. Victor looks like your auntie if your auntie wore a vintage catsuit in burgundy velvet, accessorised with a domino mask. She has silver hair in a boy cut and a lazy smoker’s voice you can’t help but listen to. Last of the great local originals. “Vic.” “Cal Sounder. Sam let you in.” “I promised to be well behaved.” “Why, yes, Cal, I’d love to buy your shiny bridge.” “Susan Green.” “Have a mojito instead. She’s not on yet. And don’t call her that. It’s Diamant when she’s working.” “She a singer?” “Yes, Cal, my star singer is a singer, isn’t that amazing?” “She got any particular admirers? Regulars?” Victor doesn’t think much of that question. “In this place? Honey, she has hundreds. You wait.” “Titan. First-doser. Mama’s boy hair, bad shirts.” “Ugh. The boyfriend.” Roddy and a cabaret singer. “You’re not serious.” “That’s what I said to her. But the two of them, honestly, Cal. Like lovesick fauns. I banned him, of course. All the sass went out of her when he was watching. All that sparkling sex just…poof. As soon as he wasn’t here, it was better. But still she went from ‘none of you can keep up with this vagina’ to ‘look but don’t touch’ in the space of a week. I could cry.” She helps herself to my mojito instead. “Well, you weren’t going to drink it anyway. Sit here and brood, darling, and don’t start anything. Diamant will grace us with her nun’s cabaret in twenty minutes.” “He’s dead, Vic.” “Who’s dead?” “The boyfriend.” She stops, eyes hard on mine. “No shit?” “No shit.” A long silence. “Damn.” “Yeah.” “And you’re on it.” “Yeah.” “You maybe change your profession recently? Become a grief counsellor?” “Still a detective.” “Damn.” “Maybe you’ll
