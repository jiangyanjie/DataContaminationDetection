hands against the glass. His torso expands and contracts like he’s taking long, slow breaths. In and out, in and out. And then, after a moment, he disappears from the skylight, and his steps retreat down the opposite side of the roof. “Did he see us?” Bezi asks, panic invading her voice. “I—I don’t think so,” I stammer. But we can’t chance staying here. I yank Bezi toward the hatch in the kitchen floor, and we lower ourselves down just as the sound of glass shattering breaks the silence. I pull the hatch closed above us and sprint down the tunnel. I fumble with my flashlight but can’t get it to turn on while I’m running and dragging Bezi along behind me. I stumble over my own feet as we reach the end. From behind us, the hatch creaks open. I climb up the ladder under the boathouse, and Bezi scrambles up after me as footsteps echo down the tunnel, rumbling toward us. Bezi moves to the door, but I stop. “Wait,” I say, panting. “For what?” Bezi shrieks. I grab an oar from the rack beside the stacked-up canoes and hold it high above my head. There’s a scuffling at the bottom of the ladder, and then the blond woman I saw in the woods sticks her head out of the hatch. I bring the oar down as hard as I can, and it lands right on the top of her head with a sickening crack. She slumps forward, her torso on the ground in the boathouse, her legs hanging down the hatch. She groans and then lapses into unconsciousness as blood pools on the dusty floor under her head. “Oh my god!” Bezi screams. I lift the oar again, preparing to bring it down on the next person who pops up, but there’s no one. It’s quiet. I toss the oar aside and loop my arms under the woman’s armpits. “Help me, Bezi!” Bezi grabs the woman’s collar, and we wrench her up and out of the hatch. Bezi slams the trapdoor closed and slides a canoe over it as I tie the woman’s hands and feet with a length of 550 cord we keep in the boathouse. She’s breathing, but the blood is still flowing from her head in crimson rivulets. I move to the door and peer out. The front doors of the Western Lodge are sitting open and the window overlooking the front porch is shattered. I cup my hand over my earpiece. “Kyle?” The static crackles and pops, and then Kyle’s voice comes out. “I’m here.” “Is the generator working? Can you see anything on the cameras?” “Yeah,” he says. “And somebody was in here when I showed up.” “What? Are you okay?” “No,” Kyle says, his voice trembling. “I—I had to hurt him. He jumped on me and—and . . .” “Kyle, listen to me,” I say. “It’s not your fault. You did what you had to do.” He sighs into the mic. “I don’t think he’s dead, but I used my knife. Charity, am
