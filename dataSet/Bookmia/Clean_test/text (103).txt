nothing else,” I say. “You think shortbread’s too sweet.” “Thought you might want something,” he says. His eyes look more green than gray right now. I’m finding it hard to look at them, so I train my gaze on the candy. “It looks like you thought I might want everything.” His eyes flash. “Was I wrong?” “No,” I say, “but you didn’t have to do that.” “Trust me, it wasn’t intentional,” he says. “I walked up for the water, and next thing I know I’ve got a wagon filled with corn syrup.” “Well, that’s the Connor family thriftiness. If you buy a wagon, refills are free.” His laugh turns into a groan. He runs the back of his hand up his forehead. “I’m so hungover.” “Didn’t you have one drink last night?” “If we’re ignoring the half bottle I drank in the cellar,” he says. “We should probably ignore everything that happened in the cellar,” I say. He studies me for a second. “Anyway, I have no tolerance anymore. I drink less than ever these days.” “Wow, humblebrag,” I say. He laughs. “Actually, it’s just that I’ve been using edibles.” At my surprise, he says, “They’ve been really helping my mom, but she gets kind of embarrassed. About taking them on her own. So a couple times a week, I’ll split a brownie with her. She’s funny. She’d never even tried weed before, and she gets super giggly.

I’ve probably gained like fifteen pounds.” “It suits you.” I quickly add, “How is she, really?” He glances at me askance. “You haven’t talked to her?” I’m sure he knows I still text regularly with Gloria. I even field the odd text or two from his sisters. Mostly when his little sister, Lou, wants my opinion on a potential present for Wyn, invariably a gag gift that requires no special insight whatsoever, or when his older sister, Michael, wants an opinion on a medical ailment that invariably has nothing to do with neurosurgery. As far as his family knows, he and I are still engaged. “I do talk to her,” I say. “But I figure she’s mostly lying.” Wyn’s laugh is low. “I’m sure she is.” His gaze drops. I let mine linger on the dark fringe of his lashes, the curve of his full upper lip, until his eyes lift. “It really does help. The weed. Just . . . not enough.” Emotions tangle in my esophagus. Globus sensation, my mind supplies, as if naming it will take away the ache. It doesn’t. “I’m glad you’re there with her,” I say. His lips part, come together, part again. “I, um . . .” He sets the boxes of candy and cup atop the air hockey table beside us and shifts
