my eyes shut. “No need to shoot if you don’t want to.” There’s a tinge of worry in her voice. A line between her eyes. “You could fire or discharge or—” “I want to. It’s just . . .” I’m not motorically able to. Which Cece might know, because she crosses her arms, tilts her head in that compassionate way of hers, and tells me, “Maybe if you say it in a funny accent, it’ll be easier? May I suggest Australian? Not to be culturally insensitive, but those closed e’s are just—” “I hated In the Mood for Love,” I blurt out. “And I find very little enjoyment in Wong Kar-wai’s filmography.” Cece startles. Physically. Spiritually. “But . . . but they are amazing.” “I know. Well—I don’t know. They look like I should find them amazing, but to me they’re just sad and kinda slow. Still better than the Russian ones from the seventies, which feel like rubbing brambles against my eyeballs, and I really think producers should stop giving money to Lars von Trier and instead pick a good charity. Even just flush it down the garbage disposal, honestly. And don’t get me started about 2001: A Space Odyssey—” She gasps like this is a theater play. “You said you loved it!” “I . . . Maybe. I mostly repeated things I found online.” She frowns at the backsplash tiles. “Your review did sound very similar to Roger Ebert’s,” she mumbles to herself. “I hate all auteur-style movies.” My mouth feels like a desert.

Closes it. Opens it one last time. “Which one?” she asks, sounding constipated. “I don’t know.” I wince. “All of them. The fourth?” Is that a whimper? Maybe. Yeah. And I don’t know what I expected her reaction would be, but it was not this one. Not her glaring at me and then something hitting me hard on the forehead. And then again. And then— “Is this—” I lift my hands and take a protective step back. “Are you throwing cheddar cubes at—” “Damn right I am!” She takes a two-second break to turn off the stove and starts again. With improved aim and vigor. I back down till the counter stops me. “I knew you weren’t watching hentai porn that time! I knew I saw that shovel-face guy on the screen, I knew it, I knew it, I—” “Not the cheese, Cece!” The stoning stops. And when I peek between my fingers, Cece is there, a bag of Great Value cubed cheddar clutched in her fist, staring at me. Her eyes are brimming wet. “Why?” she asks, and my heart breaks, and I want to take it all back. It was a joke. I love Wong Kar-wai, and Kubrick is the best. I’m still the Elsie she wants, and tonight we can have a Jodorowsky marathon. It’s such
