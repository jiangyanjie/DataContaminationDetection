feel in every cell of my body. A moan slips from my lips as I clutch the pillow beneath me. “You like that?” “Yes.” The next one, he moans right along with me. And god, that’s even better, knowing he’s loving this, too. “Harder? Softer?” “Harder,” I beg, and the next time he spanks me, I gasp out, my legs turning liquid, pleasure curling hot and low in my core. I’m certain sex has never been this freeing. In between spanks, he smooths circles on my cheeks while filth falls from his mouth. “Lift up. I want to see that gorgeous pussy.” I lean forward, pushing up on my elbows, raising my hips. “Jesus, this view.” He slides a finger beneath me, runs it through my slickness. Drops a few taps where I’m most sensitive. I’m no longer sure I’m breathing.

Yes.” I remove my mouth just as he starts to tremble, and he gives one more thrust against my chest before he falls apart, warmth slicking my breasts. He reaches beneath the chair for a towel before he draws me back on top of him, and I’m limp and spent and indescribably happy. Several minutes pass before he rolls over to get his phone. When the familiar opening of “Whoomp!
