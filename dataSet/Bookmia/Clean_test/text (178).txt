And you and you! Yes, you’re perfect!” He took one stool and placed it in front of Nurse Ratched’s cage, well out of reach of her tentacles. Then one in front of Rambo. Hap. Victor. When he finished, he clapped. “There. That’ll do until we make more permanent arrangements.” He hummed under his breath as he went back to his desk. Reaching up above it to another shelf, he pulled down a long object not unlike one of Rambo’s pincers. He squeezed the handle, and the ends of the object opened and closed. “This was a toy human children used,” he said. “They called it a robot arm, but it is not robotic in the slightest! Isn’t that odd? They used it to grab things just out of reach. But watch what I use it for!” He picked up one of the folded pages and, as if he were carrying something dangerous, tiptoed his way over to the stool in front of Rambo’s cage. With his tongue stuck out between his teeth, the Coachman gripped the robot arm with both hands, lowering the page to the stool. “Ta-da!” he said with a flourish. “Your very own label! If you could, my small friend, please read the words aloud so that I can hear if any changes need to be made.” Rambo beeped once, twice, rising slightly on his lift. Then, “VACUUM. USED BY HUMANS TO CLEAN.” He spun in a circle, waving his arms. “That’s me! Oh my goodness, that’s exactly right! Vic. Vic. He’s so good at this!” The Coachman grinned. “Thank you for recognizing the greatness of my work. I will remember this moment forever, or at least until my body breaks down, leaving only my deteriorating consciousness that will undoubtedly devolve into a mimicry of human insanity. Nurse, oh, nurse. It’s your turn.” With a little shimmy of his hips, he glided back to the desk, picking up another piece of paper. Skipping back to the cages, he used the robot arm to drop the page on the stool. “Beautiful miss, if you could, please read the words upon your label.” “No,” Nurse Ratched said. “I am not in the mood.” The Coachman blinked. “The mood? What do you mean, the—oh. Oh. I see! Well, far be it from me to tell a lady of your caliber what she should or should not do. No, I won’t have you tiring out your precious circuitry over something like this. Fear not, I shall read it for you!” “You should come closer,” Nurse Ratched said. “I promise not to strangle you until your head pops off and falls to the floor.” On her screen, the words YOU CAN TRUST ME! I’M A NURSE! The Coachman waggled his finger at her. “Ah, you almost got me there! You are a delight. Your star burns bright, no doubt about it! Your label reads: NURSE REGISTERED AUTOMATON TO CARE, HEAL, EDUCATE, AND DRILL. PERFECTLY PRESERVED.” Nurse Ratched was silent for a moment. Then, “I do not detect any lies. You may continue.” Rambo beeped.
