behind this conversation didn’t bode well. “Sometimes new Rockettes have a hard time adjusting to the role. The restrictions of this style of dance can feel stifling for some. You’re a terrific dancer, don’t get me wrong, but there are times you stand out from the crowd. I think you know what I’m talking about.” “I know I’m getting more notes than any of the other dancers. I’m sorry for letting you down. I want to be better, I do.” If she lost this job, she’d have to completely start over: find an agent who would send her out on auditions, try to please producers and casting directors. She’d seen enough of her fellow residents at the Rehearsal Club go through the cycle of audition and rejection to know that it took serious resilience to tread the boards of Broadway.

Outside, the air was cold and a few flurries skittered under the streetlights. “Marion.” She turned to see Peter leaning against the building a few feet away. He wore a navy peacoat and a woolen cap over his head, and some of his curls peeked out from the sides. His eyes were blue and bright; he looked like some handsome sailor who’d just arrived in town. Something about him was different, and it took her a moment to realize it was because he was smiling. Usually, he was such a serious man. “What are you doing here?” “I got a call today. Somers wants to see me again, first thing tomorrow.” “Why? What’s happened?” She shivered and pulled her scarf closer around her neck. “It’s cold out here. What do you say we grab a bite?
