did everything you could. You walked your path, you stayed faithful in your own way, and that’s all I can ask. And who knows,” she adds, “maybe, after I’m gone, we’ll meet in prayer from time to time. Like the saints did.” I hold her as tight as I dare, both of us now weeping. It is the first time in weeks, months, maybe years, that I have felt more like her child than a parent. “This is your final battle, you know that. You should have gotten so much more time,” I say. “But if you can’t have that, then I want you to be able to feel some peace, and have time to prepare, the way Dad did.” “I told the priest that I’m afraid to die,” she admits to me. “I’m so afraid to meet our Lord. I don’t feel worthy. What have I ever really done?” The answer couldn’t be more obvious to me if it were written in the air before us, but I understand why she asks, because I know the feeling of unworthiness all too well. I have always felt as though I have something to prove: I have to do more, be better, to make other people’s gifts and offerings worthwhile; to earn their care or justify their faith. I spent years trying to live up to the noble sacrifice I believed my birth parents had made, while also trying to be good enough for other people to love. I am still living as if the choices made by others—from my first parents giving me up, to my adoptive parents loving me and then letting me leave—are debts I have to repay, marks in a ledger I can never hope to expunge. Even this trip, and all the essential tasks I’ve assigned myself—have I not approached them as though I have something to atone for? As if there exists some list of things a good daughter does for her dying parent, responsibilities I didn’t fulfill for my father, and now I have to prove my love and loyalty by ensuring that I don’t fail again? But my mother has never thought of my life or our relationship in such a way. Even when she has been upset with me, confused over decisions I’ve made, saddened by the physical distance between us, I have never had to do anything to prove myself to her. I am enough for her, without any action or justification, without proofs, just as I am. That’s what she meant when she told me, as a child, that I could never disappoint her. That’s why she and my father always said it didn’t matter where I went, what I did with my life, what I accomplished—they would always be proud of me. That’s why she believes that there is nothing for her to forgive now. I can choose to accept her at her word or not, keep chastising myself or not, but the truth is that this is what she has long believed: I am her daughter, so I am enough.
