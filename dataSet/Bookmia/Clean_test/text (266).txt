forgot to be careful, and I didn’t care. I’m extremely ashamed of myself. And I still don’t care. Maybe this is doable. Maybe I can be with her. I go back to my office and smell bleach. I sit in front of the terminal and try “Antonin” along with the Marx Brothers in Roddy Tebbit’s file. It doesn’t work. I go up on the roof and refill the doc box. The green light has gone out; the orange one hasn’t come on. I don’t know what that means. I don’t know how much these pieces of meat matter, any more. I don’t know what Doublewide wants to do with them. Maybe this. Maybe he’s doing it. He knows I’m involved with Athena now, if he didn’t already. Stefan is waiting for me to tell him I’ve destroyed Roddy Tebbit’s data. Gratton is waiting for me to tell him what the hell is going on. It’s getting to the point I have to pick a side. Or make one. I look out across Othrys. It’s oily black all winter long, then azure blue all summer. There’s a public beach by the Tappeny Bridge, and since last year, when they moved all the junkies on and combed the needles out, it’s a nice beach. Out beyond it, the sun comes up over the mountains, and on days like this it just sits there in the crack of the Typhon pass. If you go all the way out there there’s a tunnel for the railway, and the two huge statues they put up that mark the edge of the greater city boundary: Gaia and Cronus, metal skeletons coated in white composite that tries to be marble. She holds the earth in a sling, and he carries a sword with two blades, one coming off from the other two thirds of the way up like a leaf or a curved tongue. I think about Roddy Tebbit in Susan Green’s sketchbook. She drew him as Perseus, the mighty warrior holding aloft the head of a monster. In kids’ books, Cronus always has a sickle, or sometimes even a scythe, but he didn’t in the original myth and he doesn’t on the statue. Like Perseus, he has that weird two-tongued sword. The design is not some whimsical Ancient Greek lifestyle choice. It’s a chopping weapon for an ugly kind of war: a working man’s tool that pierces like an axe when you need to cut armour, or a butcher’s hook when you want to gut someone. It’s nasty and unromantic and functional. That kind of sword has a name, because nasty, unromantic functional things do. It’s called a harpē, and that’s what Susan Green tried to tell me in the second before the car threw her in the air. I’m an idiot from my toes to my hat for thinking she said “Harpo.” I’ve been wasting time. I go downstairs to my office and bring up the matrix password screen. It takes a few minutes to get it right, but I open the file. Or, actually, files, because
