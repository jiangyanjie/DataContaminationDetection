is where we fell in love with you, Kimberly.” “To be clear,” Cleo tells Kimmy, “I was in love with you well before that.” “Awwh! You guys!” Kimmy instantly tears up. “You’ve always made me feel like I belong.” “Of course you belong,” I say. “You were our missing link.” Parth settles into the chair beside Sabrina’s. “We needed a redhead to round us out.” “Keep your eye on those blue-haired ladies, by the way,” Sabrina says, looking toward the women nursing sodas at the next table over. “When they go, we’ll grab one of their chairs.” “I’m fine to stand,” Wyn says, pulling the final available chair out for me. He meets my eyes. “Go ahead, honey. Give yourself a break from those heels.” I wonder if my fake smile is doing anything to soften my very real glare. “Well, someone sit,” Parth says. “You’re making me nervous.” “You know what?” I touch Wyn’s bicep. “I’ll sit in your lap.” He balks, and I push him toward the chair. With the air of one resigned to his grisly fate, Wyn sinks into it, and I drape myself across his thighs like a living toga. His arm comes around my back, a highly impersonal touch, but it’s all it takes for my body to remember, replay, relive that moment in the cellar. A server stops by, and Sabrina puts in an order for a pitcher of margaritas, a truckload of fries, and Cleo’s usual soda with lime. “Could I get one of those as well?” I call as he’s walking away. As badly as I want some alcohol to disrupt the electrical impulses firing through my neurons, I need to stay clearheaded. The memory of Wyn’s velvety murmur: Arms up, baby. My drunken warble: Did you get me the shirt about the rodeos? My spine prickles. The backs of my thighs warm. The crowd is roaring along to Shania Twain now, a bachelorette party tipsily leading the charge from the karaoke stage at the back wall. Before Kimmy, Cleo mostly dated ultrahip people who were completely uninterested in hanging out with us. Laura, who rode a motorcycle and had the bridge of her nose pierced. Giselle, who always wore red lipstick and never laughed. Trace, who joined a punk band that got huge, and then dumped Cleo for the famous model daughter of another famous model. Then Cleo met Kimmy, a gorgeous and affectionate goofball who never stopped laughing, while working on an organic farm in Quebec. The first time she came on the trip, Kimmy, Sabrina, and I smoked the best joint of our lives in the Lobster Hut bathroom, then performed “Goodbye Earl” together. From the beginning, she belonged. With Cleo. With us. An uneasiness needles between my ribs. Again, I find myself wondering what we’ll be, exactly, after this week, when the trip is over and the cottage is sold. When Wyn and I come clean. Sabrina has started filling salt-rimmed glasses from the margarita pitcher, and I fight the urge to throw one back. Instead, I lean across
