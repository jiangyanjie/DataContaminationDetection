with her about my daughter, I could feel her hand pressing down on mine, the warmth of her fingers, the grain of the wooden table at which we sat. I could hear her voice, as clear as it was in life. You can tell me all about it, she said. And then you’ll figure out how to help her, like you always do. When I woke, it occurred to me that perhaps my mind is trying to mother me, now that my mother is gone. 25 At around eight by ten, my office is the smallest of our small bedrooms, squished between the master bedroom and my older daughter’s room. I claimed it as my work space when we moved into this, the first residence of my adult life that has felt semipermanent. I pushed an old table up against the room’s only window, pleased to find that during the day, at least, there is no need for a lamp. We painted the walls a soft blue green that reminds me of sea glass, and I hung up original art and carefully arranged the bookshelves. I hadn’t had a dedicated writing space all to myself, with a door I could close, since I took over the spare bedroom in my childhood home. For our first two years in the house, the study was my primary work space, the backdrop for all my video meetings, the place where I went to brainstorm and to write. Then we got a dog, and I pretty much stopped working there altogether. For years, whenever one of our children asked us if we could get a puppy, Dan or I would offer up a vague response: Maybe someday, when you’re old enough to help.

Both of us had grown up with dogs and cats and were generally pro-pets, but we also knew how much extra work it would mean. Then came the pandemic. Sometime between my mother’s funeral in the spring and back-to-school that never quite happened in the fall, maybe gave way to yes and someday became as soon as possible. Saying yes to the dog was very much about saying yes to our kids in the worst year of their lives. They’d lost so much in such a brief space of time: another grandparent, visits with family, familiar routines, a sense of stability and safety. Their schools were still closed, which meant they spent five hours a day in front of their Chromebook screens, being reminded to sit up straight and keep their cameras on. Their world had shrunk to the four walls of our house, our yard, and the neighborhood we meandered through day after day. We knew that we were luckier than many. We were trying our best. But none of us were doing well, and the first long pandemic winter was on the way. This dog, I decided, was going to be the family comfort animal. The kids picked out
