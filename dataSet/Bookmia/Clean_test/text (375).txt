remained. “Now, look here, Virginia,” my father said as he continued to stare at the knife. “There’s no need for that.” I kept my own gaze on Ricky. “Tell him! Tell him you love me and that we’re going to run away and find our baby and have a happy family.” “But he doesn’t want that,” my father said. “Do you, son?” “You’re lying.” I turned to Ricky. “Tell me he’s lying!” Ricky’s gaze also skipped about. To the unlit fireplace, to his hands, to the zebra rug under his feet. Anywhere but at me. “It’s true, Ginny,” he mumbled. “I’m sorry.” “See?” My father’s tone was shockingly boastful. He was, I realized, enjoying the worst moment of my life. “I know you’re hurt now, but it’s for the best.

It allowed you to get married, pretend that Lenora was my child, and keep your precious reputation intact.” His words caused something inside my mother to break. I watched it happen. Her eyes went dark and her body still. Standing silent and motionless, she reminded me of a clock unnervingly stopped at midnight. Yet one small part of her continued to tick. I saw that, too. Something coiled around the gears of her mind, ready to spring. And spring she did. Toward my father. Knife in hand. Not stopping until the blade was deep in his side. My father didn’t scream when the knife plunged into him. I did that for him, letting out a sharp cry that pinged around the
