is, not something from the Chersenesos military chic which was popular last year. Just a black T-shirt and a green jacket, and a pair of trousers with those giant pockets. Military pattern boots, too, but those are a little less spartan. There’s a flash of red at the ankle and I can see padding. She puts her arms around Athena and glowers at me. “What’s he doing here?” “I brought him,” Athena says. “He’s like Maurice. Always hanging around.” “No, mother. That’s me. Cal runs away.” Ow. Elaine gazes at me or through me for a while, then up into the sky. The moment stretches. I wonder if she’s going to fall asleep, or just stand there until she gets moss growing on her. She doesn’t seem to be aware of us at all. Athena waits. You can’t see anything on her face that says she hates this moment, fears what it means, but she does. Elaine turns around and stomps inside. “Come on, then.” The last time I was in her house, it was a different house and a different Elaine. It was a pool party and she wore a swimsuit with cutaways around the belly button and hips, and huge black sunglasses that made her look half like a rock star and half like an alien in an old movie. Maurice Tonfamecasca was there too. He could barely take his eyes off her, palpable sexual desire radiating from him as he watched her walking around, assembling a map in his mind of the body under the suit. She was Stefan’s unattainably glamorous ex, giddy and hugely popular survivor of years of Titan-style debauchery. There was a feature in Time, and rolling coverage in Paris Match. That was years ago. It occurs to me to wonder whether she’s had some work done on her face—just enough, and expensive enough, so that you might not think of it. That Elaine might have. This one…I don’t think so. Athena nods to the doorway. “Let’s go.” She waits a moment, and when I don’t move, she shrugs and leads the way. * * * — Inside the house is like the apartment you always thought you’d have one day: clean lines and ample space for furniture that looks comfortable and yet perfect; wide windows looking out over the forest and the lake. There’s a fire pit for actual logs, so well done you can barely see the extractor and the filter unit, the long pipe down to the plant room where the carbon gets molded into little black bricks and taken away once a week by the service company. I can smell pine smoke lingering in the air, the way it used to when I was a kid in the mountains. It’s like being ten years old again. Athena’s mother makes gin cocktails and pours them into thick earthenware cups. She leads us out onto the rear deck, which looks down into a canyon, water rushing down towards the lake. There are birds here, lots of them, and a late season bug drifting up
