have a word with my friends in private.” “You have one minute,” Bernard said. “I can’t give you any longer. Don’t make me regret this.” He stepped back away from the crates. The Coachman knelt down next to the crate, arms resting on the side. Vic looked up at him. Hap gripped his sides, fingers digging in. It was almost grounding, and he wondered why he should feel as relieved as he did. “My dear boy,” the Coachman said in a low voice. “Thank you.” “For what?” “Showing me the world isn’t as cold as I once thought.” He reached down and squeezed Vic’s hand. Vic couldn’t speak past the burning in his throat. He nodded, squeezing the Coachman’s hand in return. “I wish you well on your adventure,” the Coachman said as he pulled his hand away. “I hope you find what you’re looking for.” “Coachman,” Bernard said, a new urgency in his voice. “It’s time.” “Yes,” the Coachman said, smiling down at them. “It is.” He stood, and with a twitch of his mustache, stepped away out of sight. Bernard appeared above them. He reached down and pulled the lid over them. Before he shut it completely, he said, “There’s a button. To your right. Do you see it?” “Yes.” “It will open the crate.

He opened his eyes, and breathed in through his nose and out through his mouth. Hap was a warm presence behind him, his hands still on Vic’s sides, fingers brushing against the metal of Vic’s battery vest. It was small. The crate was small. The crate was small, and they were trapped inside. Vic turned his head, looking for the button that Bernard had mentioned. He found it in the corner above their feet. All he would need to do is kick it, and the box would open. It would open, and they would be free. They could stand. They could breathe, because the air was growing thick inside. He gripped the pack tighter as he struggled for control. Bile rose in the back of his throat, acidic and hot. And then Hap whispered, “Tell m-me.” “Tell you what?” Vic gasped, shifting against Hap, feeling the slide of metal and skin and wood against his back. His helmet bumped the lid overhead. His thoughts were clouded, like a
