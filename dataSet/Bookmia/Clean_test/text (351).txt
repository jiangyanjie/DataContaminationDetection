his wedding toast, to get to witness your love and commitment. We can’t wait to see the life you’ll build together. They never saw me as choosing one kind of family over another, one dream or one life over another. They could not imagine a future in which I did not pursue everything I wanted. * * * We drove all over the region with my parents that week, taking advantage of the good weather and the timing of our trip; mountain roads that would have been impassable during the winter months were clear and open in early fall, and the occasional drizzle didn’t deter us. Mom made us pose for pictures in front of a lighthouse, at the seaside botanical gardens she loved, on a bridge stretching over a rushing river gorge. My anxiety eased as the visit wore on, and it was a pleasant surprise to discover how much I enjoyed reacquainting myself with our little corner of the Northwest; time and distance had increased my appreciation, and I forgot to feel trapped or out of place when I saw my husband wide-eyed at the deep cerulean beauty of Crater Lake, the serene glory of a redwood grove, the wild cliffs overlooking the Pacific. I took pleasure in being the one to introduce him to these places I felt an uncomplicated love for, places that had been a familiar solace to me growing up. Sometimes, though, I noticed that my father would lag a bit behind or wait in the car while the rest of us tackled a trail. There were nights when he would pick small, petty fights with me, the way he sometimes did when his blood sugar was uncontrolled and his mood fluctuated as a result. Hurt, confused, I argued back, simultaneously angry and embarrassed that Dan was there to witness our bickering. In calmer moments, when I asked Dad if he was feeling all right, the most he’d admit to was being a little tired. Mom quietly told me that he was experiencing some neuropathy in his feet. His eyesight was worsening, too; he needed a new prescription. I don’t remember if I thought to ask whether he was getting the treatment and medications he needed. I know I watched him more closely after that, but he didn’t seem to have any trouble maneuvering around the house or the neighborhood. It was the last time I would return to my childhood home, although I didn’t know it then. Soon my parents would sell the house and move into a manufactured home fifteen minutes up the highway, with a view of different mountains. By the time our visit with them was over, I felt foolish for having worried about it. My family had been overjoyed to see us, and Dan, easygoing middle child that he was, had not been remotely fazed by our little squabbles. I could almost imagine bringing our future kids back here one day, showing them the sights. Sometimes, looking at my mother, I felt sure that she was picturing the same. 5 My
