his finger slips inside my underwear, I can sense him stumble, unsure where to start. “Here,” I say, reaching down to guide him until we both find that sensitive bundle of nerves. I graze it with the lightest touch. “Do you feel that?” “I—I think so.” He lets out a sharp breath. “Oh. Yeah, I feel it.” “You okay?” “Just fifteen years of ineptitude crashing down around me.” I shed my underwear to give him easier access. A concentrated tension runs from his cheekbones down to his jaw. His touch is gentle, exactly the way I told him to be. Uncertain, and there’s something undeniably sexy about that. I relax into it, letting him slowly, slowly take control. “Yeah?” he says when my breathing quickens, and I pant out a yes. But then he slows down too much and I lose the momentum, and I have to swallow down the frustration. This must go on for at least fifteen minutes—getting close before the pleasure fades away. “I—I’m sorry. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.” With his other hand, he swipes at his brow. “What if we tried something else?” We’d be deviating from the outline, but it might be necessary. “What if . . . what if I showed you how I make myself come?” The idea already has a new kind of pressure building in my core, my heart rate quickening.

Or down?” he asks. “I don’t want you to be too hot, or too cold. Since, uh, that’s the function of a thermostat. To keep from getting too cold. Or too hot.” He rakes a hand through his hair. “Am I being too awkward about this? Because I can guarantee you, I’m going to enjoy it.” “Yes,” I say, laughing, even as heat rushes to my cheeks. “But it’s very cute.” I sink back onto the bed, head pressed against the pillow. The temperature in the room jumps at least twenty degrees as electricity races through my veins. Maybe I should have asked him to turn down the thermostat after all. Yes, he’s seen me naked, but that was back when I thought he was one-night-only. He wasn’t taking in every detail of my body. I let out a shaky breath and run a finger down my stomach. Past my navel. I start slowly, taking my time to find a rhythm, every ounce of awareness focused on the warmth beneath my hand. My body is tight, knees still nearly touching. With every rotation of my finger, I feel my legs loosen. Finn’s reactions spur me on, banishing any lingering self-consciousness. A flutter of his eyes when I slide
