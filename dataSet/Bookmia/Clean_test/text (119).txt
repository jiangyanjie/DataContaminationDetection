there is a break deep in the woods where the light from my flashlight cannot reach. I tell myself it’s a deer, a fox, something that belongs here and not the images my mind has conjured of some unnaturally large birdlike creature. Bezi is squeezing my hand so hard that my bones ache, but I don’t say anything. The pain keeps me alert, reminds me that I’m out here with one thing to do—find Porter and Paige. We trudge down the trail for thirty minutes before coming to another oak tree whose trunk has been painted black, a small owl carved at the base. Another trail extends beyond it, snaking off into the blackness. “Somebody put these carvings here,” Bezi whispers. “Why?” “I think they’re like the mile markers on the road,” I say as we push on down the new stretch of pathway. “Like guideposts or something.” “Leading where?” Bezi asks. I shrug. “I don’t know, but Tasha was out here, running from something, and she was terrified. She was injured so bad. Something happened. I just—” I suddenly feel like I can see a little farther into the trees. I can see a little more of the night sky overhead. “The trees are thinning.” Ahead, there’s a flickering orange light. I gently squeeze Bezi’s arm and quietly lead her off the path into the cover of the trees. I click off my flashlight and press my finger to my lips in a plea for silence. Bezi covers her mouth with her hands and crouches down as I switch off her flashlight for her. Just ahead, there is a clearing and what looks like some kind of wooden platform illuminated by a large torch. “Somebody is out here,” I whisper against Bezi’s ear. Keeping close to the ground, I inch forward, crawling on my stomach across the dirt and dead leaves. After a few minutes, I have a clear view of the opening among the trees. It’s a large open airspace. A wooden platform in the shape of a crescent stands beneath a massive oak tree. It reminds me of an outdoor amphitheater. Opposite the stagelike platform are three tiers of wooden risers—seating for at least a hundred people. I press myself flat against the ground as Bezi crawls up beside me. “What is this place?” I ask. Bezi shrugs and sinks lower in the brush. We watch in complete silence for several long minutes. There is no movement, no sound, and after a while, I slowly stand up. “What are you doing?” Bezi whisper-yells. “Get down!” I’m only thinking about how much time we’ve already wasted by hiding in the bushes. Porter and Paige can’t wait around for us to work up the courage to find them. “Come on.” The flashlight stays off as I lead Bezi out of the brush and into the open space ahead. The path leads us right into it. The blazing torch casts a hazy orange glow all around. I scan the area again, listening. There’s no one here, but somebody had to have been,
