Rambo. Before the floor closed above them, cocooning them in darkness, the Coachman called down, “Not a word. Trust me when I say you do not want the Authority finding you.” The floor re-formed and through the grinding noise, Vic heard the door shut firmly behind the Coachman. “Great,” Rambo said. “Now we’re in cages and it’s dark. Anyone else get the feeling that the Coachman has a few screws loose?” “V-vic?” Hap said. “Here,” Vic said. His voice cracked. He tried again. “I’m here.” He reached out between the bars, searching. He flinched when something brushed against his fingers, but then Hap gripped his hand tightly, holding on. “I aim to misbehave,” Nurse Ratched said. Vic heard one of the panels on her sides slide up, and a tentacle extended, a sound as familiar as his own heartbeat. “One moment. One moment. While I am searching, would you like to hear an interesting fact? Dolphins sleep with one eye open. Searching. Searching. Ah, there you are. I knew there had to be a port down here somewhere.” Her screen lit up in pure white, the brightness almost painful in the dark. Vic turned his face away as Hap held on to his hand. “You inserted yourself into the house?” Rambo asked. “Oh my goodness, what if it tries to hurt you?” “It will not,” Nurse Ratched said. “I am not attempting to bypass the security measures.

They watched as the Coachman raised his hand in greeting to someone off camera. “Ho, hi, ho!” he called. “Welcome! Is there anything I can assist you with?” He stepped off the porch into the sand. “We n-need to get out of h-here,” Hap said. “I th-think I can break the bars. We r-run as f-f-fast as we—” He stopped. Everything stopped. On the screen, in front of the Coachman, four figures appeared. Three of them were smooth men, dressed similarly to those who’d come in the whale. Vic couldn’t tell if they were the same androids, or similar models. The smooth men all looked the same. But it was the fourth figure that commanded his attention, the fourth figure that caused Hap’s words to cut off. Because the fourth figure was Hap. Oh, there were notable differences. The Hap on the screen carried himself with purpose. Each step seemed perfectly measured, his shoulders squared. His skin and limbs were intact, no trace of wood anywhere. On the chest of his jacket was a familiar circle, the emblem in the middle that of a fox and a cat. The smooth men seemed to defer to him. When he spoke, his voice crackling through Nurse Ratched’s speakers, he did not stutter. “You there,” this strange Hap said, his
