the rubble for something? Should she pull a board free from the barricade? She paused before it, rife with uncertainty even as her thoughts roared at her to hurry. At the corner of her eye, a wounded soldier was bowed over, weeping for his mother. His agony pierced Iris, and she decided she would take a board of wood from the barricade. There was no time for her to chase down the nurses or the doctors, who were already overwhelmed. There was no time to find a stretcher. She began to claw at the structure, determined to work a plank free. She didn’t feel the shadows or the cold that rippled through the smoke. She was so intent on liberating this piece of wood that she failed to realize that the wind had ceased and frost had spangled the cobblestones at her feet. “Down, down, down!” The command cut through the mire and the chaos like a blade. Iris froze, lifting her eyes to the churning sky. At first she thought the clouds were moving. A thunderstorm was building. But then she saw the wings, long and pronged, transparent in the fading light. She saw the monstrous white bodies emerge as they flew closer, nearly upon the town. She had never seen an eithral before. She had never been this close to one.

Any minute, and they would be overhead. “Mum,” the soldier beside her moaned, rocking on his heels. “Mum!” Iris glanced at him with alarm. So did Roman, a vein pulsing at his temple. “You must be quiet,” she said to the soldier. “You must stop moving.” “I need to find my mum,” the boy wept, beginning to crawl over the ruin. “I need to go home.” “Stay down!” Iris cried, but he wasn’t listening. She could see her breath; she could feel her heart pounding in her ears. “Please stop moving!” A shadow of wings spilled over her. The stench of decay stole through the chilled air. This is the end, Iris thought. She looked at Roman, five paces away. He was so close, and yet too far to reach. She imagined their future. All the things she wanted to do with
