Kyle stands as still as a statue, gripping his knife. “What—what do we do?” he stammers. I move to the window and peer out at the parking lot. Bezi’s car is sitting in the cone of light emanating from the floodlight. It’s too low to the ground, and I realize it’s because the tires have been cut. I can hardly think straight. A wave of panic rushes over me, and I sit on the stool behind the counter. I’m trying to survive. That’s all I want—to get out of this place alive. I stare at Bezi and then Kyle, both of whom are silent and clearly scared to death. I am too. I shift my gaze to the office counter and see the game book sitting open, the names of the guests and staff penciled in. I’ve been playing the part of a girl who escapes a serial killer every night for months. It’s not a game this time. The consequences are real, but we still have to play. “I’m the final girl,” I say. “It’s literally my job to survive the night. We don’t have any good choices here.” I grab the game book and look at the roster, trying to think of a way to make any of this work in my favor. “It’s just the three of us here for right now. Javier and Tasha aren’t going to leave us here alone. I’m sure that as soon as they can, they’ll get somebody else up here to help us.” “What about the pickup truck?” Kyle asks. “We don’t have the keys,” I say. “Mr. Lamont has them, and even if he didn’t, the tires are probably cut.” “Why would you say that?” Bezi asks, her eyes wide. “Your tires are cut,” I say. A dreadful silence settles over us. “We have to dig in and wait for help,” I say. “Keep trying the cell phones. We’ll get a spotty signal at some point, and we can use it to call Mr. Lamont, but until then, we have to play the game. We get our stuff together, we use the tunnels, we stay hidden. We survive the night. It’s the only way we get out of here alive.” Kyle shakes his head. “I can’t believe this is happening.” I put my hand on his shoulder. “They’re not the only people who can put on masks and scare people.” We make our way back to the Western Lodge and bar the doors, cut out the main lights, and take stock of what we have to defend ourselves. It’s not much, but it’s all we have to work with—an assortment of dull kitchen knives, table legs, a half-empty can of bear spray, and the headsets we use to communicate during the game. We plug in our cell phones, and I help Bezi get her headset on. “Just leave the channel open—that way you won’t have to toggle it on and off,” I say. “One of us should get to the control center and see if the cameras are still working.
