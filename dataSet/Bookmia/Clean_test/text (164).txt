people. The frame protests—loudly. I just hope it can hang on till morning. As we lay in the quiet dark, Paige sighs. “You know, if this was a horror movie, Tasha would be sealing our fate by getting it on with Javier. You really think she would do that to us if the stakes were life-and-death?” Me and Bezi exchange glances, and then all three of us laugh until tears run out of our eyes. “We’d be doomed,” I say through wheezing laughter. I’m suddenly lying wide awake, staring up at the ceiling. The cabin is dark aside from the glow of the porch light filtering through the tattered curtains. Bezi is nuzzled up to me. Her rhythmic breaths blow warm and sweet across my neck. At the foot of the bed, Paige is sprawled out, arms and legs spread wide, her foot dangerously close to my face. I nudge her, and she curls into a little ball. I pull Bezi close to me, and she readjusts herself. In the rustle of clothes and bedsheets, there is a noise. Bezi settles and I hold still, listening. From somewhere outside, in the direction of the lake, there are footsteps. I wonder if maybe Tasha is coming over to apologize to Paige, but I glance at my phone—it’s almost three in the morning. Slipping my arm from under Bezi’s head, I roll up and perch myself on the edge of the bed, letting my bare feet rest against the wood floor.

There is something, or someone, moving around out there. The figure is hunched over, staggering their steps, pulling something along the ground. “Bezi,” I whisper. “Paige. Get up.” Paige grumbles something to herself as Bezi sits up and readjusts her bonnet. “What is it?” she asks. “What’s wrong?” “There’s somebody out there,” I say. There’s another loud splash, and I whip my head around, straining to see in the dark. Bezi stumbles out of bed and joins me at the window. We press our faces close to the glass, fogging it with our breath. “Where?” Bezi asks. “Across the lake. Right there.” I scan the shoreline until I spot the figure again. This time they’re closer to the camp side of the lake, and whatever they were dragging is now gone. Bezi sighs. “I still don’t—” A hand clamps down on my shoulder, and my heart leaps into my throat as
