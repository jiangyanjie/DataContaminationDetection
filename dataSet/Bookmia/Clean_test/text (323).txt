as I check my notes the following day at our morning meeting. “Anybody have any suggestions on how to fix it?” “Have we tried WD-40?” Porter offers. Javier closes the curtains in the main lodge, trying to keep the light from the rising sun from accosting us. “What’s WD-40?” he asks. “It’s, like, some kind of grease or oil for hinges,” Porter says. “Keeps them from sticking. My dad uses it on stuff around the house all the time.” “I’ll check the supply shed, but I don’t think I’ve seen anything like that,” I say as I sink into the ratty old couch in the Western Lodge. The seat is so low, I’m almost touching the floor. It used to have a trundle underneath that kept the middle from sinking in, but during a game a few weeks ago, some of the guests thought it’d be funny to use it as a raft on the lake. Now there’s just a big open space under the couch that comes in handy if we need a quick place to hide during the game but sucks when you forget about the empty space, dive into the couch after a long day, and almost break your tailbone in half on the floor. I check my to-do list, which is growing longer by the minute. I have a headache just thinking about how difficult that’s going to be when we’re so short-staffed. “Where the hell is everybody?” Javier asks. “They just dipped? Real professional.” “Oh, right,” Kyle says, turning to me. “That reminds me. I went over to the big cabin and knocked. Nobody answered. I looked inside. It’s a mess in there, bunch of trash and stuff lying around, but they’re not in there.” I’m irritated that Jordan, Heather, and Felix left a mess behind for the rest of us to clean up. “Yeah, they’re no-shows,” I say, rubbing my temple. “That means it’s just the five of us for tonight’s game and the big show tomorrow night and . . .” I hesitate. Nobody is going to want to hear the next part. “And listen, after the final game, I need everybody to stick around and help close down the camp.” “Huh?” Porter asks. “Wait, wait, wait. Nobody said anything about staying past closing night.” “I know,” I say. “Heather and Jordan volunteered, but since they’re MIA, somebody has to do it. I’m staying, too, of course. If we all pitch in, it’ll take maybe two days max.” Javier shakes his head. “Nope. I got plans.” Tasha scoots closer to Javier and nudges him with her shoulder. “You sure you gotta go?” Javier smiles, and his eyebrows shoot up his forehead. “Uh. I mean, no. I guess not.” “What plans do you have anyway, Javier?” Kyle asks. “Hanging out with your grandma?” The smile is gone from Javier’s face immediately. “Yeah. So?” Javier tilts his head to the side. “She’s good company. And she can cook.” He puts his hand on Tasha’s leg, and Porter rolls his eyes. “I can stay,” Javier says. “But I
