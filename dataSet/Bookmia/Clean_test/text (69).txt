our neighbor’s mailbox before saying, I can’t do this, turn around, and never got into a car with me in the driver’s seat again. His temper could be unpredictable. He was not what I’d call good in a crisis. At times, though, he surprised me. I remembered his serene pride at my wedding, the only one of four parents who didn’t make me cry or lose sleep that week, and how much it helped to talk to him when I was homesick in my first semester of college. Tell me all about it, you know my hugs cure the blues. He was not my idea of a rock, but he was my mother’s constant. Her life, for nearly forty-five years. She shouldn’t have to fight for her survival without him. The bright colors in the paintings all around us blurred together. Blinking back tears, I did what I thought Dad would have if he were here: I tried to make her laugh. “You know, it’s not like he would have been much help.” I was rewarded with a faint chuckle. “That’s probably true.

Sometimes, sitting with my mom in the house they’d shared, it was so easy to believe that he was out for a walk, or in another room; that any moment, he would enter and tease one of us, pick an argument, turn on one of his ball games. I knew I’d never get used to seeing her without him. But sometimes she managed to bring him near again. She was the bridge between us, remembering things even I forgot. When she was gone, would it be like losing him again, too? We both began to cry, drawing more glances I didn’t care about. For a moment, I considered asking her for the reassurance
