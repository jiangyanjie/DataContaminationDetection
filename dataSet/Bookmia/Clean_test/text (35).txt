was not an accident. The Washing Away of Wrongs After the heavenly flowers disease disappears completely from the Garden of Fragrant Delights, the last survivors return to their families or, in the case of concubines and servants, to their masters, and I’m free to go back to my rooms. I’m determined to visit Meiling, since the suspicions that arose from Miss Chen’s utterance directly concern my friend and the herbs that were meant for me, but I need to get settled with my family before I do anything else. I also have much that I’m eager to discuss with my husband, but my first night home he doesn’t come to my bedchamber. A disappointment. I fall asleep feeling exhausted and dispirited. The next morning, when Poppy pours my tea, she brings the gossip that Master Yang is going to remove Miss Chen and her sole surviving child, Fifth Daughter, from the Garden of Fragrant Delights. I dress and then rush to find my husband. He’s in his library. “Is it true your father is casting off his concubine and her daughter?” I ask. Perhaps this is not the correct approach as Maoren and I have not been alone together since I left for Beijing seven months ago. So much has happened, including the birth of our son, but I haven’t given my husband a chance to express his joy or thank me for doing what I could during the smallpox outbreak. “Since when have the hens begun to crow?” he asks, squinting his disapproval.

She was courageous when—” “The concubine has already been dismissed,” he says, swiveling away from me. “She will take her daughter with her—” “Her only surviving child,” I emphasize. “And Fifth Daughter is your half sister.” I can see him tasting this idea on his tongue and finding it bitter. “Without a son and without her beauty, Miss Chen has no value to my father.” “Fifth Daughter is only ten years old,” I press. “There is nothing I can do. It is my father’s decision.” I nod and leave Maoren to his books. I realize there’s little time. I go straight to the front gate, where I find Miss Chen and her daughter. “I don’t know what’s to become of us,” the concubine whispers. I have no words to reassure her. Few options exist for a woman like her. Watching her leave with only the clothes on her back, the scars on her face, and her child is sad beyond measure. A
