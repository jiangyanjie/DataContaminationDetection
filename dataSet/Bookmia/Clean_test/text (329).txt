do, but I follow suit, and he does. He says grace. “Lord, our Father, bless this food and our endeavours. We thank you for all that you are, all things that have been and all that is to come. In your hands, O Lord. In your hands.” Doublewide looks up, and a smile lights his face. “Mr. Sounder, I’m proud of you. You see? You can be pleasant after all.” “Don’t tell anyone. That’s even more secret than you are.” “I’m not secret, Mr. Sounder. Just shy.” “Not for nothing, but a cop died today.” “Theirs is a dangerous profession. Laudable, of course, if sometimes locally inconvenient.” “This cop ate his gun. Turns out he was driving a certain vehicle. You saw it when you pulled my fat out of the fire.” “Ah, indeed.” “You have anything to do with his sudden feeling of remorse, Mr. Nugent?” “No, Mr. Sounder, very much not. I should have preferred him discursive. I suspect his death is very much of his own engineering, though of course one always looks to the employer in such a context.” Always, and always assuming that wasn’t Nugent himself, double games hardly being unknown in organised crime. “Did you know Roddy Tebbit?” “You ask a lot of questions for a dinner guest, Mr. Sounder. Please be so kind as to pass the baguette basket.” He can reach the basket, of course. Figure he prefers not to. I pass it along, and Nugent makes a little jazz hands gesture, palms out. “I adore French baking, sir. Adore it.” “Roddy Tebbit, Mr. Nugent. If you don’t mind.” “I knew him a little. We were not friends, but…those of us who are not like the others…well, we meet, inevitably. You conceive that the attempt on your life was related to your investigation.” “I do.” “So do I.” “You turned up at a real convenient moment for me. How’s that happen?” “Good fortune on your part. We were rushing to protect Miss Green.” “And how did you know she needed it?” “Oh, I deduced it, of course. With Mr. Tebbit dead, the possibility is plain.” “Did a bang-up job. She’s worse than me.” “Alas, we may strive for omniscience, but omnipresence is somewhat more problematic.” “I hear Roddy had plans to survey Lake Othrys. Algae or some such.” “Yes, so I gather.” “It crossed my mind maybe you didn’t want that to happen, what with your shyness and all.” Doublewide claps his hands duchess style, wrists close together, pat pat pat with his palms like flippers. “Oh, yes! The lower reaches are said to be a museum of gangsters murdered in the early days. But Mr. Sounder, I assure you, I’ve no bones to pick in that regard. No, indeed, sir. Did Mr. Zoegar not specifically advise you that concrete boots were not on the agenda?” “I took that as a metaphor.” “It was, it was. You need have no personal fear. But as it happens, it is also literally true. The lake and I have no secrets together. Let the waters drain away,
