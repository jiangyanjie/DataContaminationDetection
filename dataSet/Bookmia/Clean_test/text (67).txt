shoreline and surrounding peaks a thousand shades of green. The lake stretches out fifty li, maybe more. The embankment is built of stone. Bridges—one with four hundred arches—bisect the lake at different spots. Shrines dot the hillsides. A pagoda rises like a ladder fourteen stories into the heavens. A crane swoops and cries out. Up ahead, I see Maoren, who greets me with a beckoning wave. When I reach him, he takes my hands in his. “I’m happy to have you here,” he says. Servants have set up a picnic of freshwater crabs, for which Lake Tai is known, soup, rice dumplings wrapped in leaves and tied with string, pickles, and jars of rice wine. Couples sit together—sometimes by themselves, sometimes in little groups. Second Uncle and Second Aunt have their own circle, with their sons, their wives, and grandchildren. He has rightfully earned the respect befitting an elder in the Yang family, and, after all these years, Second Aunt is content, if not actually happy. Elsewhere, some of the usual divisions have been forgotten as boys and girls play together. Below us, the lake shimmers, reflecting the hills and clouds. In addition to the dragon boats, pleasure vessels—decorated with brocade curtains and fluttering banners—sweep back and forth across the water, each with its own party onboard. The time arrives for the races to begin. The first two boats line up side by side in the middle of the lake. From this vantage point, I can see more clearly the ways in which each boat’s dragon carries its own unique personality—from the curl of its whiskers to the intricacy of its scales. A gong is hit. The lead man on each vessel rhythmically bangs a drum, summoning the dragon heart of his boat to inspire the rowers. Oars fly, disturbing the glistening reflections and sending rippling waves across the lake. Maoren and some of the other men loudly urge their favorite boats to win. During the second race, some of the ladies of the household completely forget themselves and call out too. By the third race, the men and women of the Yang family are shouting together and raising cups of rice wine when their preferred boat crosses the finish line first. Next, the winners of the first heats compete against each other. More favorites are eliminated. In the early afternoon, the two finalists pull into position. I’m happy to see that Maoren’s top pick has made it this far. It would be unseemly for me as Lady Tan to express my emotions by cheering as the gong is hit. Unseemly or not, sounds burst forth from me with such exuberance that I’m forced to clasp my hands over my mouth. For many years my husband has followed the adage that instructs Ascend the bed, act like a husband; descend the bed, act like a gentleman. But in this moment, decorum is forgotten. He wraps his arm around my waist and pulls me close. More wine is poured. Couples, families, and groups of unmarried boys leave our pavilion to ramble the shade-protected
