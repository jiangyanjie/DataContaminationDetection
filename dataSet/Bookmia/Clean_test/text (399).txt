the costume shop, a long line of seamstresses worked on candy cane–striped smocks and jeweled gloves, the buzzing of the sewing machines filling the room like a giant beehive. One dancer stood on top of a wide table, being fitted into a short skirt by a woman with pins in her mouth. “The shoe and hat department is just down the hall,” said Bunny. Marion was impressed. “Wow. The only thing missing is a restaurant.” “Basement level. We have a swell cafeteria that’s great for grabbing a muffin when you arrive in the morning. They take good care of us here.” “I can see that.” “And now for the final stop on your tour.” They’d reached the top of the stairs, and Bunny pushed open a heavy metal door. Sunlight blinded Marion as she stepped out. They were on a wide expanse of roof, about ten stories up, surrounded by the skyscrapers of Rockefeller Center. There were deck chairs scattered about, a net for some kind of ball game, and even a shuffleboard court. “This is where we relax, although if you get a sunburn, Mr. Markert will ban you from the show until it fades. Do you play Wiffle ball?” “No.” “It’s a blast.” She turned back to Marion. “I saw you dance. You’re phenomenal.

It’s like the entrance of the Shades in La Bayadère.” Marion had seen the ballet several times and knew the moment Bunny was referring to. To the velvety sound of violins, a line of thirty-two dancers dressed in white slowly made their way down a ramp and onto the stage, repeating a simple series of steps punctuated by an arabesque. For four minutes, the hypnotic power of so many women moving in perfect unison was undeniable, and the audience never failed to burst into applause when they were finally assembled onstage. Bunny walked to the door that led back into the building and held it open. “But then again, maybe you just had a good dance day. Keeping up that level of precision is not for the weak.” “You’re trying some reverse psychology on me, aren’t you?” said Marion with a grin. She liked Bunny’s energy, her confidence. “I’m onto you.” “Just telling
