car. You don’t have yours?” “Upstairs,” I say. “We’ll have to wait until they get sick of waiting and send someone to hurry us up.” Wyn groans and drops onto the top step, setting the bottle down by his ankle. He bows his head and knots his fingers together against the back of his neck. At least I’m not the only one panicking. Of course, I’m freaking out about being here with him, and he’s freaking out because he’s claustrophobic. He has been ever since he was a kid and a broken armoire fell on him in his parents’ workshop while no one else was home. He was trapped for hours. As soon as the door’s open, he’ll be fine. Whereas I’ll still be reeling from the purchase of a stupid coffee-table book. The whole stairwell sways as an awful realization hits me. I latch on to the banister to keep from falling over. “What? What’s wrong?” Wyn leaps up, steadying me by the elbows. His drawn mouth is visible in bits under the black splotches swimming across my vision. “We were taking two cars,” I squeak out. “We were taking two cars, so all four of them could’ve left in the Rover.” His eyes darken, clouds creeping across the green. “They wouldn’t.” “They might,” I say. “We don’t need to assume that’s what happened. They could be back any second.” He stares at the ceiling, doing some kind of mental calculation. I descend the rest of the steps, trying to regain the space between us. But he follows. “This isn’t my fault, Harriet.” “Did I say it was?” I ask. “You stormed off,” he says. “There’s an implication there.” I spin back to him. “Wyn. We’re in a twelve-foot box. That wasn’t storming. There isn’t room for storming. But if your point is to remind me that I shut the door, point received.” “I’m not blaming you. I just—who the hell has a door that locks from the outside?” “It’s a panic room,” I point out. “That’s what the little panel on the wall does. We could unlock it if we knew the code.” His gaze clears. He climbs the stairs in three long strides to examine the panel. “There’s a button to call 911.” How long will it take for them to realize something’s wrong? Will they drive all the way out to pick up the pre-hike popovers without trying to call us? If they do call, will they assume we don’t answer because we’re driving? My stomach resumes its roiling nausea. “You want to call or wait?” Wyn asks. Now I’m doing the math of how expensive it might be to replace this door if the fire department has to ax it down or blow it up or something. “I think . . .” I take a steadying breath, try to find a grip on some version of my mental happy place that has nothing to do with this house or this man. “I think we have to wait, for at least a while.” It’s obviously not the answer
