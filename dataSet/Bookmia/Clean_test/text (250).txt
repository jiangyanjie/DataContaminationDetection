crashed in Tokyo or something.” “Oh, that kind of left? Like in a hurry?” She grins. “Like a man seeing his ex-wife show up with her lawyer. First proper human thing I saw him do. He got a call and: poof. He was out the door and down the line. Didn’t even hang around for the thank-you speech.” “Ouch. Girlfriend, you think?” “I couldn’t possibly say,” she says, then ruins it with “but the things one hears about that man it could hardly be anything else. Now shoo! I have to figure out this rotation. Go carry someone!” “Can I bring you another coffee later?” “If you want to find the way to my heart, bring me one from the place over the street.” “Yes, ma’am.” Stefan Tonfamecasca was here the night Roddy Tebbit was killed. And he left early. * * * — Sometime after I get back to bed, Marcus the nurse brings a Jell-O shot full of nutrition that tastes of steamed broccoli, and he’s pleased to poke me in the bullet hole again and remind me to wash it. He gives me a squirt bottle like the ones boxers have to drink from between rounds and says I can just sluice some soapy water over myself. A passing registrar makes an inappropriate wolf-whistle and later a tired nurse-administrator ticks boxes and signs me out. I’m done. * * * — I walk down the street through the snow.

But I really want to. * * * — I stop by my place to change clothes because the ones I was wearing when I was admitted are a mess. The hospital laundry got the blood out but they’re still busted at the seams and there’s a hole in the jacket and the shirt where the bullet went in. I look like the ghost of Jack Ruby. I shower and I’m having fantasies about raking my fingers over the skin. I do what Marcus said and splash water over the wound from the bottle and that makes it about a billion times worse. God knows how I’m going to survive doing that every six hours and not touch it. Maybe it’s better I don’t try and just end up with a skin discolouration that looks like a sphincter. I breathe in the steam, tasting metal pipes and the deep mineral background of Othrys, ice and iron and shale. Why did someone want to kill Susan Green? Was Roddy Tebbit right
