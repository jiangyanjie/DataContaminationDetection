living room and sit on the couch beside my daughter. In her expression I read compassion, sadness, weariness. A deep well of concern. Her face was the first I ever glimpsed that looked anything like mine—from the moment of her birth, I knew that I was not alone. Now nearly twelve, she never resembles me more than when her steady brown eyes, my eyes, are like this, serious and appraising. She has always been her own person, frequently leaving me, the person who birthed her, wondering where she came from and who she will be. And yet I know she is who she is in part because I am her mother, just as I am who I am because of mine. “Mama,” she says, “are you okay?” I know she means in this moment, not all the ones to come. I reach for her, pull her into a hug, and give her the truth. “I’m not okay,” I say. “But someday I will be.” I will be. Because of her, and her sister, and my husband, and everyone who loves me. Because my parents love me, and to live is to remember them. I will always miss my mother. In the months and years to come, I’ll wish for many impossible things: that cancer had never invaded her body; that the world had not changed; that I could be with her when she died; that I could have split myself in two, defied the laws of the universe and linear time, to be present in every moment she and my father needed me. But I will also feel a deep and profound gratitude for our last day together. For whatever it was—love, grace, chance, or premonition—that pushed me to ask for her forgiveness, tell her that her life was a blessing and I was lucky to be hers. I won’t have to wonder if she understood or forgave me. I’m not holding on to anything I wish I’d told her. In the end, there was nothing broken or left unsaid between us. While my mother sleeps, my daughter and I sit side by side, our faces half-lit by the westward-facing windows, watching the sun creep down to the edge of the mountains my parents and I have known and loved in every season. We talk about the evening ahead: When Mom wakes up from her nap, we’ll ask what she wants for dinner, burgers or tacos. Maybe we’ll watch a movie, or play a game of cards—she is teaching my daughter how to play rummy—or maybe we’ll just sit and talk until it’s time for us to go to bed. We have to leave in the morning, but we still have one more night. I keep my arm around my daughter, and together we wait for my mom to wake. Notes & Acknowledgments I am deeply grateful to Marie Howe, whose words have long been a source of solace and inspiration, for permitting me to title this book with a phrase from her poem “For Three Days” and excerpt “What the Living
