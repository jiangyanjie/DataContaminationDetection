this trip.” “I’m sure it’s going to be great.” Dan squeezed my hand as we walked through the gate, both of us already on the lookout for my family. At twenty-two and twenty-three, we looked like college kids returning home, though it was the wrong time of year for that. We had married the previous summer, having not so much overcome as outlasted his parents’ objections over how young we were. This was his first trip to Oregon, and I was very aware that we were doing things in the wrong, or at least unexpected, order. Shouldn’t he have been home with me before now? But unlike his home, mine was so far away, and so hard to get back to, even when I wanted to go. My parents were waiting for us on the other side of the security doors. “You made it!” Mom said, as she always did when I landed. She meant you made it through your flights, and also you made it through however long it’s been since your last visit. She looked much the same as she had the last time I’d seen her, though her hair, once copper-red, now reddish-brown, was growing out from the pixie cut she’d had at my wedding. It was my father that I surveyed with an anxiety I tried not to let on. His dark hair had gone gray years ago, like that of all the men in his family, and his blue eyes were alight with happiness as my parents tackled us with hugs, but did he look more careworn than he had the last time we’d seen him?

Anyone looking at our group might have assumed that Dan was my parents’ child. Not that he looked much like either of them with his mother’s thick dark hair and easy grin, though at a hair under six feet, he was exactly my dad’s height—it was just that I looked nothing like any of them. I made my habitual survey of the room as we waited for our suitcases. As I’d expected, I was the only Asian in sight. * * * “The Jesuit missionaries didn’t only see themselves as bringing the Catholic faith to Indigenous people, but ‘civilizing’ them. What does that really mean, to ‘civilize’ someone?” our professor asked, looking around the seminar table. After a pause, I said, “To make them more like you.” I was the only freshman in a roomful of upperclassmen, and still found the rapid-fire discussion somewhat intimidating; my papers were well written, the professor had told me, but I should learn to speak up more often in class. Now he nodded at me, and I thought I read a trace of approval in the half smile accompanying his “yes.” In another class, the professor asked each of us to
