plenty loud, to Orhan. “What about Mullen?” “I got more on the shitbag.” There’s a loose board in the hall but it’s not that loose. I worked pretty hard to get it right. It creaks when someone steps on it, but only if that person weighs in excess of one hundred and fifty kilos. I listen, and I hear the faintest whisper. My visitor is standing right on the board, very still. “We’ll come back to that. Mullen.” Creak. Orhan says: “The other kind of asshole. Sad story.” “Oh yeah, how so?” Creak. There’s a Taser in the top drawer of my desk, and next to it a five-inch knuckle knife, like vanilla brass knuckles grew a single sharp tooth. There’s a real gun, too, but if I use that I can’t ask questions later. Hanging on a wall hook there’s a megaphone. Figure I can summon assistance with that and it’ll be here in an hour or so. If I dump the call with Orhan and dial emergency, or tell him to call the cops, Gratton will be here in twelve minutes, give or take, but the person on the other side of the door will hear and things will kick off. Twelve minutes is a long damn time in a small room with a Titan. I take the Taser and the knife, make some “uh huh” sounds to cover the noise as I turn the carpet over and run the Taser cable from the lamp stand to the wall by the door, then flip the carpet back on top. Orhan is still talking about Mullen. “I think he was a good guy. Like we all could play pool together. Drink tea.” I hear the board release, like a sigh. Still can’t hear the footfall, but now I can hear the shape of a body in the hall just outside, the shadow in the room tone. “Orhan, he absolutely shot me.” “Yes, obviously, we cannot play pool together now. He shot you and also he shot himself. But still basically I think he was a decent fellow.” I go over to the door, crouch on the far side from the hinge. My door opens to your left because for the majority of people that’s weird and uncomfortable. I say: “That is a flexible fucking definition of that word.” The door smashes open. Huge fucking shape in black, two and half metres high and proportionately broad. Superhero big. He’s wearing a ski mask over his face and executive tactical gear: black camo slash-stop trousers with a non-conductive chain weave boxer built in to stop anyone stabbing or electrocuting you in the private parts. Steel-toe boots and some sort of gi-inflected combat jacket in the same ballistic fabric Susan Green’s shawl was made from. I fire the Taser before he can look around. The current goes straight into the desk lamp and makes it explode. The guy flinches back from it: flying plastic and stink, but he’s smart. He tucks and goes into a punch combo in case someone’s coming for him, puts
