that, really, but hearing it makes the words come even easier. If I’m going to be truly open with him, I can’t go back—and maybe I don’t want to. Maybe I have always been able to trust him like this. “I had an abortion,” I say. Not looking away. Not avoiding eye contact. “My sophomore year of college.” Finn nods slowly, letting me decide how much I want to share. “I’d been seeing this guy for a few months. David. I wasn’t always the best at taking birth control pills, and we just kind of assumed since we were using condoms, we were being safe. But I missed a period, and then I started feeling nauseous, like, all the time, so I took a test. And it was positive.” David had been sweet, equally happy to go to an off-campus party or watch a movie on the threadbare couch in the house he shared with eight other roommates. We’d met sitting next to each other in a physics class we were both taking for a science credit. “He told me that it was my decision, that he’d support whatever I wanted to do. I could see my whole career stretched out in front of me, or at least my vision of what I wanted it to be, and when I saw those two lines on the stick, it just . . . completely changed. “I didn’t have the money to raise a kid,” I continue, running a fingertip along the floral comforter. “I didn’t want to raise a kid, not when I had so many other plans for my future.

He’s looking at me with a careful intensity, one that sets every anxious cell in my body at ease. “I’m so glad you could make that choice. And I’m not judging you. At all,” he says, voice ever steady. “I’ve never had anyone tell me that before. Maybe you could tell me if I’m fucking up this reaction?” “No,” I say. The relief is instantaneous. “You’re not.” “You can tell me anything you want about it. Or nothing. Whatever you feel comfortable saying.” When I think about that day, what I remember most is the way my mom gripped my hand in the waiting room, told me she was there for whatever I needed. How fast and relatively painless the procedure itself was, a little discomfort and then some cramping afterward. I’d never known whether I wanted kids someday, not really—it was always something I thought I’d figure out when I was older. And maybe I do, one day, but I’m still not sure. I only knew I didn’t want one when I was nineteen. As it turns out, there’s nothing
