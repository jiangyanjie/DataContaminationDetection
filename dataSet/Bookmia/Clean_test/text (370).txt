the main road,” I say. “The car won’t work back there.” Bezi takes a deep, wavering breath as she looks up at the sky. “We’re going to be out there in the dark.” I grasp her hand. “Tasha is out there.” I try to push away the sounds of her terrified screams and the thoughts of what might have caused her to sound that way. “We stay together. We move fast. No side trips. We go to the last place we know Tasha was headed; then we regroup and decide what to do from there. Agreed?” Bezi, Kyle, and even Javier nod. The path that twists around behind the supply shed isn’t maintained as well as the other paths that snake through Camp Mirror Lake. It’s overgrown with spider grass, and the gravel is heaped in uneven treads. Mr. Lamont mentioned that it used to extend all the way to Route 710 but that access was abandoned for the main entrance years ago. The trees press in on us from either side of the trail, and the darkness descends like a shade being drawn across the sky. Kyle clicks on his flashlight. I save the battery on mine, figuring we’ll need it for the walk back. The trail continues through the trees, and while a tall gate bars our path, I can see that it continues into a thickly wooded area. A rusted chain is looped through the gate, and it’s secured with a large, equally rusted padlock. I yank on it, and bits of orange metal flake off on my palm. “Great,” Javier says. “A little tetanus on the way to meet a shotgun-wielding recluse. This was such a good idea, Charity.” I ignore Javier and push on the gate. The chain is only loosely securing the entrance, and by pushing hard, a gap opens, and we slip through. “Come on,” I say, gesturing for Bezi to go through. She squeezes in and pops out the other side, then holds the gate open so I can slip through after her. We pry the gate apart for Javier and for Kyle, and when we’re all through, I survey the path ahead. The dark is almost complete now, and long shadows lean across the uneven pathway. Snaps and clicks sound from the surrounding forest. The feeling of being watched from the deepening shadows stokes a sense of panic in me. I feel like I can’t quite catch my breath or make my heart slow down. I have to beat back the fear over and over again as we push forward. “This was such a bad idea,” Javier whines as he steps on the back of my heel. I round on him. “I know we said we were gonna stick together, but damn. Can you watch my foot?” “I’m scared,” he says, his voice cracking. “There are bears and shit out here, Charity. You think that’s what Tasha was talking about?” I don’t answer him. All I want to do is find Tasha, and if I think too long about what was making her
