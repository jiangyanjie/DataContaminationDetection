seat over, where the young girl was now buried under a pile of coats. But no, it was only one coat. A camel hair coat. Judy’s coat, with a bloody hand sticking out from a sleeve. Marion stepped forward, yelling for help, pointing down to where Judy’s inert body, the red ribbon still in her hair, lay across the lap of the screaming young girl. CHAPTER FOURTEEN DECEMBER 1992 The sedan slices through the canyons of midtown, but north of Times Square a couple of roads are blocked off and we are rerouted, first east, then back west. I can tell Piper is getting more anxious, checking her watch every thirty seconds and letting out a few sighs. On Fifty-Third Street, the traffic comes to a dead halt. I look out the window. The terrain is completely unfamiliar, but I know where I am. The ghosts of buildings past hover over the minimalist architecture of the museum on one side of the street and the hulking black skyscraper on the other, like mirages. I can almost hear Mrs. Fleming’s throaty laugh and the cacophony of overstimulated boardinghouse girls as they tumble down the steep front steps. “I have to get out of the car,” I say. “What?” Piper says, startled. She and the driver exchange a worried look. “Open the door,” I demand. He pulls over as much as is possible in standstill traffic, and I open the door and let myself out before he has a chance to do it for me. Piper gets out as well and hurries to my side.

We head to Sixth Avenue. The sidewalks are crowded and for a few seconds I wonder if I’ve made a mistake, letting the car go. Then Piper offers me her arm. I take it, and the umbrella as well, holding it in my free hand as a cane. “Tell me more about this boardinghouse,” Piper says. “It was called the Rehearsal Club and was for women who were in show business.” “What a wonderful idea,” says Piper. “I wish they had something like that now. I live in the East Village and it’s always a little scary when I
