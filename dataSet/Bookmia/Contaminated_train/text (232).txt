and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me.'' ``This is quite shocking! -- He deserves to be publicly disgraced.'' ``Some time or other he _will_ be -- but it shall not be by _me_. Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.'' Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them. ``But what,'' said she after a pause, ``can have been his motive? -- what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?'' ``A thorough, determined dislike of me -- a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me, irritated him I believe very early in life.

He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged. himself to be under the greatest
