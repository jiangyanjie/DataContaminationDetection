pushes his empty plate away, irritated. I gaze at him. “Please. You’re driving me crazy.” I swallow and try to subdue the panic rising in my throat. I take a deep steadying breath. It’s now or never. “I’m pregnant.” He stills, and very slowly all the color drains from his face. “What?” he whis- pers, ashen. “I’m pregnant.” His brow furrows with incomprehension. “How?” How . . . how? What sort of ridiculous question is that? I blush, and give him a quizzical how-do-you-think look. His stance changes immediately, his eyes hardening to flint. “Your shot?” he snarls. Oh shit. “Did you forget your shot?” I just gaze at him unable to speak. Jeez, he’s mad—really mad. “Christ, Ana!” He bangs his fist on the table, making me jump, and stands so abruptly he almost knocks the dining chair over. “You have one thing, one thing to remember. Shit! I don’t fucking believe it. How could you be so stupid?” Stupid! I gasp. Shit. I want to tell him that the shot was ineffective, but words fail me.

So shit like this doesn’t come along and fuck everything up.” 401/551 No . . . Little Blip. “Christian, please don’t shout at me.” Tears start to slip down my face. “Don’t start with waterworks now,” he snaps. “Fuck.” He runs a hand through his hair, pulling at it as he does. “You think I’m ready to be a father?” His voice catches, and it’s a mixture of rage and panic. And it all becomes clear, the fear and loathing writ large in his eyes—his rage is that of a powerless adolescent. Oh, Fifty, I am so sorry. It’s a shock for me, too. “I know neither one of us is ready for this, but I think you’ll make a wonder- ful father,” I choke. “We’ll figure it out.” “How the fuck do you know!” he shouts, louder this time. “Tell me how!” His gray eyes burn, and so many emotions cross his face. It’s fear that’s most prominent. “Oh fuck this!” Christian bellows dismissively and holds his hands up in a gesture of defeat. He turns on his heel and stalks toward the foyer, grabbing his jacket as he leaves the great room. His footsteps echo off the wooden floor, and
