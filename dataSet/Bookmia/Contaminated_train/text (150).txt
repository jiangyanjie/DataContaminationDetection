 "For instance, the night before I am married! I am sure I shall not be able to sleep. Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company? To you I can talk of my lovely one, for now you have seen her and know her."     "Yes, sir."     "She's a rare one, is she not, Jane?"     "Yes, sir."     "A strapper a real strapper, Jane; big brown and buxom; with hair just such as the ladies of Carthage must have had. Bless me! there's Dent and Lynn in the stables! Go in by the shrubbery, through that wicket."     "As I went one way, he went another, and I heard him in the yard, saying cheerily: "Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before sunrise; I rose at four to see him off."       |Go to Contents |               Chapter XXI     PRESENTIMENTS are strange things! and so are sympathies; and so are signs; and the three combined make one mystery to which humanity has not yet found the key.

The next day Bessie was sent for home to the death-bed of her little sister.     Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with daisies on a lawn; or again, dabbling its hands in running water.

I did not like this iteration of one idea this strange recurrence of one image; and I grew nervous
