toward me, and wraps his arms around me, kissing my neck. “Barefoot and in the kitchen,” he murmurs. “Shouldn’t that be barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen?” I smirk. He stills, his whole body tensing against me. “Not yet,” he declares, appre- hension clear in his voice. “No! Not yet!” He relaxes. “On that we can agree, Mrs. Grey.” “You do want kids though, don’t you?” “Sure, yes. Eventually. But I’m not ready to share you yet.” He kisses my neck again. Oh . . . share? “What are you making? Looks good.” He kisses me behind my ear, and I know it’s to distract me. A delicious tingle travels down my spine. “Subs.” I smirk, recovering my sense of humor. He smiles against my neck and nips my earlobe. “My favorite.” I poke him with my elbow. “Mrs. Grey, you wound me.” He clutches his side as if in pain. “Wimp,” I mutter disapprovingly. “Wimp?” he utters in disbelief. He slaps my behind, making me yelp. “Hurry up with my food, wench. And later I’ll show you how wimpy I can be.” He slaps me playfully once more and goes to the fridge. “Would you like a glass of wine?” he asks. “Please.” Christian spreads Gia’s plans out over the breakfast bar. She really has some spec- tacular ideas. “I love her proposal to make the entire downstairs back wall glass, but . . .” “But?” Christian prompts. I sigh. “I don’t want to take all the character out of the house.” “Character?” 132/551 “Yes. What Gia is proposing is quite radical, but . . . well . . . I fell in love with the house as it is . . . warts and all.” Christian’s brow furrows as if this is anathema to him. “I kind of like it the way it is,” I whisper. Is this going to make him mad? He regards me steadily. “I want this house to be the way you want. Whatever you want. It’s yours.” “I want you to like it, too. To be happy in it, too.” “I’ll be happy wherever you are. It’s that simple, Ana.” His gaze holds mine. He is utterly, utterly sincere. I blink at him as my heart expands. Holy cow, he really does love me. “Well”—I swallow, fighting the small knot of emotion that catches in my throat—“I like the glass wall. Maybe we could ask her to incorporate it into the house a little more sympathetically.” Christian grins. “Sure. Whatever you want. What about the plans for upstairs and the basement?” “I’m cool with those.” “Good.” Okay . . . I steel myself to ask the million-dollar question. “Do you want to put in a playroom?” I feel the oh-so-familiar flush creep up my face as I ask. Christian’s eyebrows shoot up. “Do you?” he replies, surprised and amused at once. I shrug. “Um . . . if you want.” He regards me for a moment. “Let’s leave our options open for the moment. After all, this will be a family home.” I’m surprised by
