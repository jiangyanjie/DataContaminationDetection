De black ones is holdin’ us back.” “You reckon? ’course Ah ain’t never thought about it too much. But Ah don’t figger dey even gointuh want us for com- p’ny. We’se too poor.” “’Tain’t de poorness, it’s de color and de features. Who want any lil ole black baby layin’ up in de baby buggy lookin’ lak uh fly in buttermilk? Who wants to be mixed up wid uh rusty black man, and uh black woman goin’ down de street in all dem loud colors, and whoopin’ and hollerin’ and laughin’ over nothin’? Ah don’t know. Don’t bring me no nigger doc- tor tuh hang over mah sick-bed. Ah done had six chillun— wuzn’t lucky enough tuh raise but dat one—and ain’t never had uh nigger tuh even feel mah pulse.
