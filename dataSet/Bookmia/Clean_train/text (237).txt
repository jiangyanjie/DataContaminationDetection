causing irritation.” Rambo’s arms drooped as he slowed. “I don’t get it.” “That is fine,” Nurse Ratched told him. “It is high-brow intellectual humor. It is not for everyone. I will try again. I just flew in from a considerable distance, and boy, are my process servers exhausted—” “Stop,” Vic snapped. “Now.” She did. He closed his eyes, trying to regain control. His head hurt. He wasn’t angry, not exactly, and even if he was, he didn’t know who to direct it toward. He internalized it. He breathed in and out, in and out. His heart rate slowed. The sweat began to cool on his skin. “I’m sorry,” he said quietly, opening his eyes again. “I shouldn’t have yelled at you.” “It is fine,” she said. “Do not worry about it.” He shook his head. “It’s not fine. You were just … being you. Thank you.” “You are welcome, Victor.” “Are we fighting?” Rambo asked quietly. “No,” Vic said. “We’re okay.” Rambo flashed his sensors in relief. “Good. I don’t like it when we fight.” Nurse Ratched rolled back over to the table, the tarp now covering the android, though it didn’t do much to conceal the fact that a body was hidden underneath. “We should not stay in here much longer tonight.

If you were. Your space is your space. You can do whatever you wish—” “Dad!” He shrugged. “I’m just saying. You’re not a child anymore. And being asexual doesn’t mean you still won’t have questions about—” Vic groaned. “Can we not? Please?” “Okay,” Dad said. “I won’t bring it up again. I know these things make you uncomfortable.” “Many things make Victor uncomfortable,” Nurse Ratched said. “It is fascinating. There is no one like him in all the world.” “No,” Dad said quietly. “I don’t believe there is.” He smiled as he looked Vic up and down. The smile faded when he saw Vic’s bandaged hand. “What happened?” Vic looked down. He’d forgotten. His mind froze, unable to think of a believable excuse. “Lab accident,” Nurse Ratched said. “Minor. Cut his palm on a carving knife. I administered first aid. It did not require stitching. It will not leave a scar.” Dad stared at Vic for a beat too long. “That right?” “Yeah,” Vic muttered. “Just slipped, is all.” “You go to the Scrap Yards today?” Vic scratched
