off-load. But her bed was her great luxury; it was very important. It simply had to be nice. The windows were shuttered and bolted. She didn’t need to peek outside to know there were men watching the house. Mr. Murphy’s boys. There’d very nearly been a skirmish with his men behind the shop. She thanked her lucky stars it hadn’t come to anything. Intimidation was one thing. Outright assaults were another. They demanded retaliation. And Mrs. Bone didn’t have the resources to retaliate at present. But soon she would, if this job were worth it, if it passed her test. She climbed out of her black dress and put on a tea gown. She had a fine collection of those. This one was the color of ripe peaches, edged with ermine. She lit a cigarette, gave it a few good puffs. It was nice to have a smoke in private. Then she hauled open her closet and started rifling through her dresses. “No good,” she muttered. “Too nice. No, no, no.” She had to push right to the back of the closet. Dragged out boots and stays. Found a neat, sad blouse, much mended. A long coarse skirt of indeterminate color. “Perfect,” she said with a wry sigh. “Oh, very nasty.” She’d look just like a daily woman, wearing that. She stubbed out her cigarette and tried it on. * * * Next, resources. She summoned a ragged-looking boy, who sat before her, head in his hands, bawling with rare splendor. He kicked his heels on the floor. Mrs. Bone counted her fingers. “And your ma. And your pa. And your Aunt Eilidh. And your cousin Gerry. And you, too.” The boy’s howls grew louder. “Now don’t start. You know what you owe.” “I don’t know nothing ’bout that!” “Well, you’d better run home and ask your pa, then, hadn’t you? Tell him Mrs. Bone got her ledger out.” He lifted his head at the word ledger. Mrs. Bone opened the book and licked a finger, keeping her eye on him. “Let’s see. Where’s your name in here?” The boy switched off his tears. She saw him calculating whether he could run for it. He realized he couldn’t. Sensible lad. “What do you want?” he said, mutinous. “I’d like repaying—that’s what I’d like. But I’m willing to make some alternative arrangements. For now.” “What sort of arrangements?” “Men,” said Mrs. Bone, digging a stare into him. “Your brothers. All six of them. And you. Seven’s my lucky number.” “What you need us for?” Mrs. Bone slapped the desk with the ledger. “That’s for me to know, and you to find out.” The boy untangled himself from the chair. He sniffled, rubbing his eyes. “They’ll ask me whether you can pay.” “Whether I can pay?” She leaned right into his face. “Wasn’t you listening? I’ll come for your ma, and your pa, and you, too.” He scrambled out of the chair. “I’ll tell ’em,” he said. Mrs. Bone nodded, done with him. “Then ta-ta, my love, and off you tumble.” * * *
