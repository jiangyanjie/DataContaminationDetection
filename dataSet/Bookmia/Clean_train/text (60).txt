shifted on his thighs. She gripped his sleeves, as if the world was spinning around them. He made a sound—a slip of breath—that made her heart race. “I’ll hurt you, Kitt!” She started to lean back, but he touched her hips, holding her steady. “You’re not going to hurt my leg,” he said with a smile. “Don’t worry about hurting me.” He drew her closer, closer until she gasped. “Now, before we can proceed with anything else, I have a very important question for you.” “Go on,” Iris said. This must be the moment. He was about to propose again. Mirth shone in his eyes. “Were you serious when you told the nurse that you wouldn’t snog me again?” Iris gaped, and then she laughed. “Is that what you’re most worried about?” Roman’s hands tightened on her hips. “I fear that once you taste something like that … you don’t forget it, Iris. And now I must see if your words from three days ago hold, or if you will rewrite them with me here, in this moment.” She was quiet, full of heady thoughts as Roman’s statement sank in.
