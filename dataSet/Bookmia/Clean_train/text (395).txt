turns my stomach over. “What’s out there?” “The . . . the . . . the owl.” Tasha’s one visible eye rolls back until only the white part is showing. Her breathing becomes shallow. “The owl,” I repeat. “Ms. Keane was talking about an owl,” Javier says. Bezi nods. “What are we going to do?” “We can drive out now, right?” Javier asks. Bezi perks up. “Get my keys out of my bag. We’ll take my car.” Javier rushes to Bezi’s bag and dumps it on the floor. Kyle joins him and helps paw through the stuff. “Where are they?” Kyle asks frantically. “Bezi, the keys. I can’t find them.” Bezi leaves Tasha’s side and searches around in her bag, turning it inside out. “I—I must have left them in the cabin?” she stammers in a haze of confusion. “We cleared the cabins,” I say. The hair on the back of my neck stands on end. “Check your pockets,” I say as panic grips me. “Check the bag again!” Unconscious, Tasha whimpers. I squeeze her hand. Something isn’t right, but we don’t have time to figure it out. Tasha doesn’t have time. “Tasha?” I say gently. But it’s no use. She’s completely out of it. “We have to call an ambulance. Everybody, check your phones. Anybody have a signal?” We all check our phones. “I got one bar!” Bezi squeals. She immediately dials 911. I hold my breath, praying that the call will connect. “Hello?” Bezi says frantically as she practically jumps up and down in relief. “Hello? We need help! We’re at Camp Mirror Lake. Please!” She pauses and her brows push together. “What? Hello? No. Mirror Lake. The camp! Please!” She holds the phone away from her face, and tears fill her eyes. “The call dropped.” “Do you think they heard anything you said?” Kyle asks. “Will they send somebody?” “I—I don’t know,” Bezi says. Kyle slumps onto the recliner with his head in his hands. “This cannot be happening.” Javier moves toward the door, slipping on his coat. “I’m going to the office to call an ambulance from the landline.” Kyle looks up. “Whoever did that to her is still out there, and you’re just gonna go for a fuckin’ stroll?” “What else are we supposed to do?” Javier asks angrily. “Just let her die?” Kyle shakes his head. “No. But—” “But nothing,” Javier says. “I’d go look for Bezi’s keys, but I feel like I’d be wasting time. I’m going to the office. You all keep looking. I’ll be right back.” For the first time in the last few days, it seems like he’s genuinely concerned about somebody other than himself. “I’ll go with you,” Bezi says. I start to protest, but Javier beats me to it. “Nah,” he says. “I’ll be okay. Stay with her.” He moves to the front window and peers out into the dark. “I’ll take a flashlight. Once I’m inside with the door locked, I’ll flash the light on and off three times; that way you know I’m safe. I’ll call an ambulance
