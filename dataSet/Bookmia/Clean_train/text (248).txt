A single tear slides down her cheek. “Please tell me you weren’t afraid I wouldn’t love you anymore.” I can only look at her, apologetic. “Oh, honey.” My eyes are burning, too. “I’m so sorry.” “Elsie. Elsie.” She takes one slow step toward me. Then another. Then two more and we’re clutching each other in a way we haven’t for a long time, ever maybe, and I’m thinking that she smells like cheese and flowers and something ineffably homey and comforting. “I will love you forever,” she says into my hair. “Even if you’re an animal with no taste.” “I know. I’m just . . .” She pulls back to look at me. “Incredibly messed up?” “Yeah.” My laugh is wet. “That.” “It’s okay. It’s not like I’m any better,” she says darkly. Her slight shoulders rise and fall. “Anything else you’ve been faking?” “Not really.” I scratch my nose. “Flushable wipes are not really flushable.” “Oh.” She cocks her head. “Is that . . . something you were faking?” “Not really, but you should stop using them.” “Okay.” She nods. “My poor butt.” “Oh, and Hedgie and I hate each other.” Her eyes narrow. “Now you’re making shit up.” “I call her the p-word when you’re gone.” “The p-word?” “Pincushi—” “Don’t you dare say it.

I love her so much. “I’m sure that we’ll be the best of friends.” 26 L I Q U I D C R Y S TA L S I RINSE THE DIRTY CHEDDAR RESCUED FROM THE FLOOR , THINKING , We should probably sweep more often; I hope we don’t get tetanus—just as Cece stands triumphantly with the last three blocks in hand and says, “This floor is surprisingly clean!” I smile into the swirling drain. “So.” She leans against the sink, arms crossed. “How much of you coming out as a lying liar has to do with Jack?” I sober up and kill the faucet. “It’s not . . .” I shake my head. “It’s a mess.” “What is?” My heart wrings. “Everything.” “But you had your sex-cation the other weekend.” I heat up. “We didn’t really . . .” I notice her raised eyebrow and abort my Deny the Obvious mission. “Have you seen Kirk recently?” “This is such an unskilled deflection attempt, I’m just gonna pretend it never happened. So, what exactly isn’t going on between you and the Jackster?” “Whatever it seemed like . . . Wherever we were going, we . . .” I grab the dishcloth. We should probably clean that, too. “I think that might be nowhere.” “How come?” I
