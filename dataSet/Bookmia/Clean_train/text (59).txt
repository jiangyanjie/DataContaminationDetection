of Mrs. Bone. “You,” Mrs. Bone said. “I want a word.” Her lungs felt too tight. She banged her chest with a fist, trying to knock them into order. “The girls,” she said. “What’s happening to the girls?” Winnie paled. Her eyes widened. Mrs. Bone jabbed Mrs. King’s arm with her finger. “I know a bad business when I see it. I can smell it a mile off. I’m not a fool. Someone’s using these girls. Getting ’em out of bed at all hours. I know what that means.” Mrs. Bone jabbed her again, harder. “You brought me in here under false pretenses.” Winnie sucked in her breath. “No, Mrs. Bone.” “I’ve been making a fool of myself, crawling around on my hands and knees, wiping everyone’s arses. You should have told me what I was getting into. It’s sick; it’s rotten. I’ve never let myself get anywhere near this sort of business.” At first Mrs. King looked entirely nonplussed. But then something moved in her eyes, a slow and creeping fear. It made Mrs. Bone clench her fists. “What sort of house was you running here?” she said. Winnie raised a hand. “Please don’t,” she said, voice constricted. “Don’t put this on Mrs. King. She doesn’t know.” “Doesn’t know what?” said Mrs. King, voice taut. Mrs. Bone let out a short bark of laughter. “What sort of person doesn’t know what’s going on under her own roof?” “Winnie?” said Mrs. King. Winnie sagged against the wall, closing her eyes. “I only found out three years ago.” “Found out what?” “Girls,” said Mrs. Bone. “They’ve been meddling with the girls.” Mrs. King’s face went very still. She took this in, assessed it. Clearly, she understood what that word meant, what meddling was: of course she did. Everyone did. “No,” she said, her voice growing cold. “That’s not correct.” Mrs. Bone snapped her fingers at Winnie. “You. Tell us. What do you know?” Winnie rubbed her hand over her face. Her voice was low, hoarse. “I was here. I mean...here, in the garden. The mews house has a loft above it. There’s a little staircase that comes down to the stables. They used to keep a carriage there, but it’s empty now. I saw a man, someone I didn’t recognize. He had a beautiful coat on. It was... I don’t know. Seal gray. Sealskin.” She took a shuddering breath. “It was very smooth, like silk. I thought: Oh, what a lovely coat.” She paused, frowning. “He was walking a girl down the stairs. I mean, he had his hand on her shoulder. He was pressing her down. Pushing her along. Like he was shoving her out. I knew at once it was wrong. I mean, my whole body felt it.” Mrs. King watched her the whole time she was speaking. Her face changed, grew ashen. “It was Ida,” said Winnie. “One of the kitchen girls. And I didn’t know the man at all.” Mrs. Bone knew that mews house. She’d seen it every time she crossed the yard. Pale gray plasterwork, ivy beginning
