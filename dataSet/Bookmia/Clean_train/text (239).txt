with some stank-ass boy.” “Hey!” Javier protests. “Sorry,” Paige says. “No offense.” “Uh, full offense taken?” Javier says. I can’t tell if he’s mad or just surprised. I bite my lip to keep from smiling, but Porter laughs out loud and doesn’t care who hears. Javier goes to the recliner and sprawls out, shutting his eyes like he’s going to sleep. On his right wrist is Tasha’s pink hair tie. “Oh, hell no,” I say. “I don’t care how late you two were up; we got things to do today, and I need everybody on board because it’s just the seven of us.” “Calm down,” Javier says dismissively. “I’m here. We’re all here. Relax.” “Don’t tell her to relax,” Paige snaps. Javier opens his eyes and levels his gaze at her. Paige couldn’t care less. She stares right back at him. “Okay, okay,” Porter says, patting the air in front of him. “Let’s all take a deep breath. We’re all in this together.” He turns to me. “I know how much this final game means to you. You’re the scream queen of Camp Mirror Lake. But maybe we should call it off. We need more experienced staff, and Felix, Heather, and Jordan decided it wasn’t even worth showing up for.” I sigh. “We’re booked. A full group. We have to figure it out even if it’s just us.” My phone buzzes in my pocket. “Unknown Number” flashes across the screen. I pick it up anyway. “Hello?” Static crackles across the line. A voice breaks through in choppy fragments. “. . . signal? Can you . . . hear . . . I can’t . . .” “Who is this?” I ask. I get up and walk around trying to get better reception, but no matter where I am, I can only get one bar. “Office,” the voice says. “Office . . . office phone.” The call drops. Bezi glances at me. “Who was it?” “I’m not sure. I think they wanted me to go to the office phone. Everybody stay here.” I glance at Tasha and then at Javier. “Especially you two.” Tasha grins, and Javier leans back in the recliner and puts up his feet. I jog down Path #1, past the boathouse and the campfire site. The lake is murky in the light of day, and I turn away from it as I pass by. I can hear the phone inside the main office ringing before I get inside. I race up the steps and get the door open just as the ringing stops. I snatch up the receiver, pressing it to my ear. “Hello?” The sound of the dial tone greets me, and I set the receiver back down. I check my cell phone again. Still only one bar and even that keeps appearing and disappearing. The office phone rings again, and I scramble to grab it before whoever it is hangs up. “Hello?” “Charity,” a rough voice answers. “You hear me?” Now that the connection is clear, I know exactly who it is . . . Mr. Lamont.
