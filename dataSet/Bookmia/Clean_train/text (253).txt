in a flat voice. “Move away from the android.” “His name is Hap,” Rambo said. “We made him. Sort of.” “I did most of the work, Gio,” Nurse Ratched said. “If there is to be any praise, please lavish it upon me. If instead you are angry and will seek to dole out punishment, please note that I had nothing to do with this because it was all Victor.” Dad jerked his head in warning. “Move. Now.” They did, Victor stepping slowly around Hap, who hadn’t looked away from Dad. Hap didn’t try to stop them, even when Rambo bumped into his leg. “Oops,” Rambo said. “Sorry. Sorry. Can you just … lift your leg a little? That’s better. Thank you.” He zoomed toward Dad, circling behind him and tugging on his pant leg. “He broke my broom when I hit him with it. But other than that, he’s not so bad.” “Are you all right?” Dad said in a low voice as Victor stopped next to him. “I’m fine.” “Did he hurt you?” “No. Dad, he’s not—” “Good,” Dad said. “Now I don’t want to hear another word out of your mouth until I ask for it.” “Uh-oh,” Rambo whispered. Dad ignored him. He glared at Hap. “Who are you? Why have you come here?” Then, oddly, “Have we met before? You look familiar.” Hap sneered at him. “Wh-who the f-fuck are you?” “My name is Giovanni Lawson. Answer my question.

His father was rarely angry. In fact, Victor could only remember a handful of times he’d ever seen it before. “We found him,” he said quietly. “In the Scrap Yards. Buried under dead machines.” He flexed his hands, knuckles popping. “We couldn’t … we couldn’t leave him. He was alive. He was awake.” Dad closed his eyes, brow furrowed before smoothing out. “And you brought him here.” “Yes,” Nurse Ratched said. “It did not seem right to leave him where he was. He has yet to do anything explicitly murderous.” “Explicitly,” Dad said as he opened his eyes. “Explicitly.” “There was the incident with the broom,” Nurse Ratched said. “It was such a good broom too,” Rambo moaned. “Why is he shirtless?” Dad asked. “Because Victor decided to remove all of Hap’s clothing in order to—” “I did not,” Vic snapped at her. “Hap,” Dad said. “Hap.” “That’s the name we gave him,” Rambo said. “It’s a good name. It stands for Hysterically Angry Puppet because he looks like he’s always mad. I think that’s just his face, though.” “What do you want?” Dad asked, taking a step forward. Hap didn’t move. He blinked slowly as he stared. “I … do n-not
