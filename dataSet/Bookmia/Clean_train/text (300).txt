by my side?” “V-vic.” “You did what you did because you were made to. My father did what he did because he was made to. What the Blue Fairy showed us isn’t you. It isn’t him.” “It is,” Hap said, so bitter that Vic could practically taste it. “You s-saw what I’ve d-done. I … hurt. I killed. Big ones. L-l-little ones. It didn’t matter. I k-killed them all.” Vic closed his eyes, leaning his head against the wall. “I know.” He pushed the images away, flashes of crimson, the flatness of HARP 217’s voice. “You remember all of it, don’t you?” “Yes. Let me g-go. Let me l-leave.” Vic almost pointed out that if Hap wanted to leave, there was little Vic could do to stop him. Instead, he asked, “Where would you go?” “I d-don’t know. Somewhere.” “Yeah, I don’t think that’s a good idea. What if something happens to me and you’re not there?” He opened his eyes in time to see Hap shaking his head. “I think I need you. As much as you need me.” “Hurt,” Hap said through gritted teeth. “I c-could hurt you.” “You could,” Vic agreed. “But you haven’t yet.” “Your neck is bruised.” Vic winced before pushing on. “You know everything and you’re still just sitting there. Do you want to hurt me?” Again, but he didn’t say it. “If it’ll g-get you to stop t-talking.” Vic huffed out a breath. Hap’s eyes flashed. “You should h-hate me.” “If I did, I would have to hate Dad too.” “You d-don’t?” Vic hesitated. Then, “No. I don’t think so. I … it’s complicated. I’m angry. I’m tired. I should never have come here. I’m not going to leave. It’s a contradiction. Discordant. A logic failure. My father created death and as penance, he created life. I’m his guilt.” He pressed a hand against his forehead. “There’s a storm in here. And I don’t see a way through it. He did what he did. You did what you did. But he is still my father. You’re still my friend. I can’t forget that, even after all I’ve seen.” “Stupid,” Hap growled at him. “S-stupid human. You sh-should have left me in the Scrap Yards. You should have l-left me to die.” “But I didn’t,” Vic said. “I made a choice. I fixed you.” “I d-don’t owe y-you—” “I’m not saying you do,” Vic snapped. “You’re free to do whatever you want. Go. Run as fast as you can. Never look back.” Vic took a deep breath, letting it out slowly. “But I have to try. And I promise you, that if we succeed, I’ll do everything I can to help you. You hurt. You killed. But you’re more than what the Blue Fairy showed you to be. The same with my father. I’m not scared of him. I’m not scared of you.” “You sh-should be.” “I’ve made my choice.” He squeezed Hap’s arm. “I need you to make yours. You’re not a puppet. Not anymore. Your strings have been cut. You’re free, Hap.” He pushed
