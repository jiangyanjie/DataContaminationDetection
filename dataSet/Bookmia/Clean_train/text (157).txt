backup. Victor often finds himself getting in trouble when he least expects it.” Vic groaned. “That’s not—” “How is the cut on your hand, Victor? Healing nicely, I should think.” It was. Scabbed over and itchy, but better. He didn’t think it would even leave a scar. “Fine,” Vic said. “But we’re going to move quick. We don’t want to be caught by the Old Ones.” “They’re huge,” Rambo said as Hap joined them. “Bigger than you. I bet they would squash you flat.” “N-no,” Hap said. “I w-would not like that. If they t-try, I will n-not be nice.” “Come on,” Vic said. “We’ll be quick. What are the rules?” “Stick together!” Rambo exclaimed. “Run if we have to,” Nurse Ratched said. “No dallying!” “No drilling.” “And above all else, be brave!” Hap cocked his head as he narrowed his eyes, but he did not speak. The moment they crested the hill that overlooked the Scrap Yards, Vic knew something was wrong. Be it morning, noon, or dusk, the Old Ones were always moving. Not now; birds perched on one of the cranes seemingly without a care. The silence was oppressive in ways Vic had never felt before: thick, as if the very air had grown heavier, making it harder to breathe. Part of him—a loud, insistent part—demanded he turn around and forget the Scrap Yards altogether. Go home. Don’t look back. Rambo said, “I don’t like this.” Nurse Ratched beeped once, twice. “There is something here. Something I have never felt before. It is … bright.” “Bright?” Vic asked, looking off farther into the yards. “What do you mean?” “Power,” she said. “It feels like power.” “The Old Ones?” “No. Something else. Hold, please. Scanning. Scanning. Scanning.” The light above her screen flashed on as she began to scan the area around them. “What is she d-doing?” Hap asked as he squinted at her. Vic shrugged. “Looking. It’s how we found you. Maybe there’s someone like you that we missed. Another android. A machine. It happens, sometimes. Usually we can’t fix them.” He glanced at Nurse Ratched. “What is it?” She finished scanning, and the light went out. Her screen remained blank. “There is something here.” “Where?” She pulled up the grid of the Scrap Yards on her screen. One of the squares blinked. 3B. Where they’d found Hap. Vic frowned. “Maybe we missed something.” “It is possible,” Nurse Ratched said slowly. “Hap’s power signature could have blocked out what is there now, or it could have activated after we left.” “But?” “But,” she said. “I do not think that is it. This is bigger. Or there is more than one. I cannot separate them if that is the case. They are too far away.” The warning in his head grew louder, telling him to turn around and leave this place. Tell him, it whispered. Tell Dad. Tell Dad that something is here and let him take care of it. But the warning was drowned out by something far more dangerous: curiosity. It tugged at Vic. He wanted to see
