this…cub…into my hands.” “Yeah.” “You understand that once he is in my keeping, your control of his ultimate destiny will be limited.” “I do. I need to talk to him in a quiet place, Mr. Nugent. A full and frank discussion is necessary between us. We’re past the point where we can just hug it out.” “And after?” “I would not expect to socialise with him any more.” “This…is not an inconsiderable request, Mr. Sounder.” “Let’s be straight, Mr. Nugent. You and I don’t make inconsiderable requests of one another, now, do we?” “I ask you for a liver, you bring me a man.” “He does include a liver.” “I am not sure that I wish one quite so entailed, sir.” I take a breath and I let him have it. “Mr. Nugent, I may or may not know where that item you are looking for is, but I will tell you up-front that I do know why you want it.

Figure Nugent likes all that even less than I do. “I shall be delighted to accept your kind invitation, Mr. Sounder. See you in twenty minutes or so.” “See you then.” He hangs up, and I turn and look down at Maurice Tonfamecasca. “Fuck you, Sounder.” “Maurice, you came to my house. Now you’ve got nineteen minutes to persuade me we can forge an eternal friendship. After that it’s out of my hands.” Maurice smack-talks me for eighteen straight minutes and ten seconds.
