The Argentinian debt restructuring is a process of debt restructuring by Argentina that began on May 26, 2005, and ultimately came to an end in 2008. Argentina had taken on 76% of the US$82 billion in government bonds that defaulted in 2001 at the heart of the worst economic crisis in the nation's history. A second debt restructuring in 2010 brought the remaining 7% of the bonds under some form of repayment to settle ongoing disputes with bondholders. Bondholders who participated in the first restructuring settled for repayments of over half of face value and deferred payment terms, and began to be paid punctually; the value of their nearly worthless bonds also began to rise. The remaining 7% of bondholders were later repaid 25% less than they were demanding, but this is no longer the case. Latin American and US-aligned leader
