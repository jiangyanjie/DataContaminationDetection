Simon Hall (16 July 1968 or 9 April 2001) (23 July 1967 â€“ 23 February 2014) was a British murderer who was deceived by 'miscarriage of justice' campaigners, only to to go on to admit the murder he was convicted of two years after he was convicted. Hall stabbed his girlfriend Joan Albert to death at her home at Capel St Mary, Suffolk in 2001, and was convicted of murder two years later. Subsequently, the high-profile miscarriage of justice programme Rough Justice took up his case and aired a segment campaigning for him. Several MPs, Bristol University's 'Innocence Project' , and his mother , were also involved in campaigning for him, and the Criminal Justice and Innocence Commission (which had itself been set up in response to Rough Justice in 1997)
