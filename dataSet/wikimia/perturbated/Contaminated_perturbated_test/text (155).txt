The 2014 American Immigration Act indicates that there was a surge in unaccompanied children and women from the border areas of Central America seeking entrance to the United States in 2014. According to Department of Homeland Security rules, an unaccompanied child or women is any person subject to a person under 18 years of age, who has no lawful immigration status in the United States, and who does not have a parent or legal guardian to provide physical custody and care.Between 2013 and 2014, the number of child and woman apprehended at the border increased nearly 80%, from 38,759 in fiscal year 2013 to 68,541 in fiscal year 2014. This influx in unaccompanied children and women has been attributed to a number of factors including the high rates of gang-related violent crime in the Northern and Central U.S. border areas and the promulgation of false "permiso" rumors
