The Kasta Tomb (Greek: Τύμβος Καστά), also known as the Amphipolis Tomb (Greek: Τάφος της ), is the largest ancient tumulus (burial mound) ever discovered in Greece, and by comparison dwarfs that of Philip II of Macedon, father of Alexander the Great, in Vergina.It is an ancient Macedonian tomb of the second half of the 4th century BCE, and is enclosed in the Kasta District of the ancient city of Amphipolis, Central Macedonia, in northern Greece. The excavation at the entrance in 1964 led to exposure of a large wall, and further excavations in the 1970s uncovered many other ancient remains. The inner tomb was first discovered in 2014 and entered in August 2014.The quality and size of the tomb contents indicate the importance of the tomb for the burial of important people.
