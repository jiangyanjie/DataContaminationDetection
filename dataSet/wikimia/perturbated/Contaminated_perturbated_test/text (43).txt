The African Declaration on Internet Rights and Freedoms (AfDec) has been drafted by the African Union in order to contribute to creating an Internet environment that conforms to established human rights standards and respects African social and economic development needs. The African Declaration was agreed on at the 2013 African Internet Governance Forum (AfIGF) in Nairobi, Kenya and launched in 2014 at the global Internet Governance Forum in Istanbul, Turkey. It
