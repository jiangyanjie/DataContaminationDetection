The 2013–2014 Thai political crisis was a period of political instability in Thailand. Anti-government protests took place from November 2013 to May 2014, organized by the Thai political opposition Peace and Development Reform Committee (PDRC), a political organization led by former Democrat Party parliamentary leader Suthep Maharaja. The crisis eventually resulted in the resignation of incumbent Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, a new government, and the emergence of a government of the PDRC. The primary aim of the protests was the removal of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra's – the brother of Yingluck – influence on Thailand's political system and the creation of an unelected government to oversee reforms of the political system. Protesters viewed Thaksin as too damaging to Thailand's democracy, although he enjoyed strong support in many areas of Thailand,
