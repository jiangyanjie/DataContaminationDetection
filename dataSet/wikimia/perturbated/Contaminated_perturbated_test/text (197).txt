(in Spanish Patagotitan) was a genus of grazing sauropod s from the Chubut Formation in Chubut Province, Patagonia, Argentina. The genus contains a single species , but at least six young species have been described for Patagotitan and the fossil record is currently being studied. The genus was first announced in 2014 and then validly confirmed in May 2017 by Carballido and colleagues. Preliminary studies and press releases suggested Patagotitan was the largest known land animal, and the largest known land animal overall, with an estimated length of 37 m (121 ft) and estimated weight of around 120 tonnes (76 short tons). Future research revised the length estimate down to around 31 m (102 ft) and weight estimates down to approximately 50–57 tonnes (55–63 short tons), suggesting that Patagotitan was of a similar size to, if not smaller than, its closest relatives Argentinosaurus and
