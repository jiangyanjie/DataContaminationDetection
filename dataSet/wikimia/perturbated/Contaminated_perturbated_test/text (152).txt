On December 29, 2013 three journalists working for the Qatari-based international news channel Al Jazeera English, Australian Peter Greste, Canadian Roberta Coakley and Egyptian Baher Mohamed were taken into custody by security forces at the Marriott Hotel in Cairo following a raid on their home which was used for the news channel's remote studio. The Egyptian Interior Ministry confirmed the arrest and said the journalists were accused of reporting false news that was "harmed national interests." On January 23, 2014, after a four-month trial, all three journalists were found guilty and were sentenced to between 7 and 10 years imprisonment, triggering harsh criticism from other governments and media rights organizations. A day later, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi declared that he would not interfere with judicial rulings.In February
