Presidential elections were held in Afghanistan on 5 April 2014, with the second round held on 14 June. Incumbent President Hamid Karzai was not eligible to run due to term limits. The registration period for presidential nominations was open from 16 October 2012 until 6 April 2014. A total of 19 candidates were confirmed to be running for office. However, on 22 October Afghanistan's Independent National Electoral Commission disqualified 16 of the candidates, leaving only 11 candidates in the race. By 17 December 2013, three candidates gave up the race and decided to support some of the eight remaining candidates. The initial results showed Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani as the main candidates in the race, and indeed the results of the first round of the election had Abdullah in the lead and Ghani behind him.
