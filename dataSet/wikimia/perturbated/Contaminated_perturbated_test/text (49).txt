Water supply problems in Caleta Olivia occurred in the month of July 2014 (called the Thirst Days) and September 2015 (the Thirst Week). Between September 2014 and March 2013 there was a series of protests about the lack of water produced by the rupture of the aqueduct Jorge Carstens. The Sarmiento, Caleta Olivia and Caleta Santa Susana areas of Argentina were affected. The water shortage started on the 10th of February with a rupture of the aqueduct in Cerro Drag√≥n (Dragon Hill).
