On 2 August that year, police responded to a report that Dhu's partner had recently left home, and were looking for Dhu. Upon arriving at Dhu's address, the officers separated Dhu and her partner after they fled. There was also an outstanding warrant for unpaid fines against Dhu. She was detained in custody in South Hedland and was to serve four days in custody , or be released following repayment of her fine. While in custody, Dhu complained of pain and was taken to the Hedland Health
