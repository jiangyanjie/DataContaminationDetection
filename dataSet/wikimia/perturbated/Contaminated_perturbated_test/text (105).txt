2013â€“2014 winter storms and storm surges were a series of winter storms affecting areas of Atlantic Europe and beyond. The French Atlantic coastal regions (chiefly Brittany), South West and Southern England, West Wales and the Spanish Atlantic coast (particularly Galicia) were especially affected by a large "conveyor belt" series of high-precipitation storms (mostly not exceptional rainfall or winds) and by the extreme low pressure created by the low pressure in the central Atlantic. Many storms were explosively deepened by a strong jet stream, many deepening below 950 m. The formation of deep lows in the central Atlantic brought excessive rains and large waves which were accompanied by some of the strongest astronomical tides of the year and caused extensive property damage. The low pressure brought heavy rainfalls which led to flooding, which had severe over flows in parts of South West England such
