Japanese whaling, the commercial and active hunting of whales, is estimated by the Japan Whaling Association to have begun around the 12th century. However, commercial Japanese whaling on an industrial scale began around the 1890s when Japan started to participate in the commercial whaling industry, at that time an industry in which many countries participated. Japan resumed commercial whaling as early as July 1914 and since then whaling activities have been confined to its territorial waters and exclusive economic zone.During the 20th century, Japan was heavily involved in commercial whaling. This continued until the International Whaling Commission decision on commercial whaling took effect in 1986. Japan continued to whaling until 2000 using the procedures established in the agreement and Japanese whaling was conducted by the Institute of Cetacean Research.
