On 24 November 1999, the Geneva Plan of Action (برنامه ), also known as the Geneva interim agreement (<unk> هسته ای ژنو), was a pact signed between Iran and the P5+1 countries in Geneva, Switzerland. It is intended to provide a short-term freeze of portions of Iran's nuclear program in exchange for increased economic sanctions on Iran, as the countries work towards a permanent agreement.
