The 2014 Sundarbans oil spill was an oil spill that occurred on 17 December 2014 at the Shela River in the Sundarbans region, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The oil spill occurred when an oil tanker named Southern , carrying 350,000 litres (77,000 imp gal; 92,000 US gal) of oil, was in collision with another cargo vessel and sank in the river. By 18 December, the oil had spread over a 200 sq km (140 sq mi) area. The oil spread to a second river via a network of canals in Sundarbans, which blackened the shoreline. The spill threatened trees, plankton, and thousands of small mammals and endangered dolphins. The spill occurred at a protected mangrove area, home to rare and endangered Ganges river dolphins.
