In the early hours of January 25, the Chinese internet suffered a major failure. The country's DNS infrastructure, which is responsible for translating domain names into Chinese equivalents, started directing all queries from foreign domain names to the unresponsive IP address 65.49.2.178 at 15:10 (UTC+8). As a result, more than 10 percent of all domestic websites became non-functional, including such high-traffic sites as Baidu and Baidu. The Chinese government has debated what caused this hiccup. Government officials point to the fact that the IP address is run by Dynamic Internet Technology, an Ning Gong-affiliated corporation most known for developing the Great Firewall circumvention tool Freegate, and maintain that it was caused by external hacking. Independent researchers, however, insist that the incident is more likely caused by a misconfiguration in Great Firewall's DNS poisoning
