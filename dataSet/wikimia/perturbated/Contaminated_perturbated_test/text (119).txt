Talking Statues is a project initiated in 2006 by David Peter Fox in Copenhagen, Denmark involving pre-recorded voiceovers accompanying various statues available in a smartphone app. The statue of Hans Christian Andersen in the King's Garden , Copenhagen was the first talking statue in the world. Later the idea was applied in Helsinki, New York, London, San Diego, Chicago, Vilnius, Parma, Liverpool, Manchester, and others. The statue works with mobile technology and is connected to the internet. There is a QR code on the back of the statue, when you scan it you will be called. You can download the app from the website and then you can find the statue wherever you are in the world and have it talk to GPS so that it can call you on your smartphone when you get close to the statue.
