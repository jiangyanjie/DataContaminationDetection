S.A.S. v. France was a case brought for the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) which ruled that the French ban on face covering did not violate the European Convention on Human Rights's (ECHR) provisions on freedom of association, freedom of expression and freedom of religion, nor other invoked provisions. On all points, the Chief Justice of the Court affirmed her decision by fifteen votes to two. The three judges in the minority expressed their partly dissenting views.The French ban against face covering, Lel. 2010-1192 du 11 octobre 2010 interdisant la dissimulation du visage dans l'espace public, was adopted on 11 October 2010 and went into effect on 11 April 2011. While the law bans all forms of face covering, it was generally understood to especially apply to the niqab.On the same day
