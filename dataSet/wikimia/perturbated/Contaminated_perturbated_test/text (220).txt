The Trojan Horse scandal, also known as "Operation Trojan Horse" or the Trojan Horse affair, involves claims of an attempt to introduce an Islamist or "Salafist" ethos into several schools in Birmingham, England. The name Trojan Horse, based on a Greek legend, comes from an anonymous letter sent to Birmingham City Council in late 2013, alleged to be from Birmingham "Islamists" detailing a conspiracy to wrest control of a school, and describing how they could extend the scheme to other schools. The letter was released to the press on 30 April 2014. One month later, Birmingham City Council revealed that following the letter release it had received dozens of allegations from witnesses similar to those described in the letter, some claims dating back over 20 years.Tahir Alam, in the Park
