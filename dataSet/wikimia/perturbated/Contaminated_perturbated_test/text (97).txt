The 13N was a demonstration against the government of President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner that took place in Argentina on November 13, 2012. It was organized by social networks. The people in the demonstration protested against the high crime rate, the high inflation and the graft and corruption scandals. The people staged their demonstration in the streets of Santa Fe and Callao, and then marched to the Plaza de Mayo, which gathered the highest number of demonstrators. There was a strong security network at the Plaza de Mayo, the main square in Buenos Aires, and the Congressional Plaza. The demonstration a mounted to a smaller number of demonstrators than previous protests, such as the 8N and the 10N. Carlos Capitanich, chief of the Argentine government and one of the prime ministers, rejected the protest and said that people should express their opinion about the government only at the general elections. ==
