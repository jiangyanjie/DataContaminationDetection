The first of these meetings was held in Nanjing on 11 February 2014 when Wang Yu-chi visited mainland China, the very first official visit between the two governments across the Taiwan Strait since the end of Chinese Civil War in 1949. The tour of the ROC delegation headed by Wang and his delegates lasted from 11 to 18 February 2014 and included stops in Nanjing and Beijing. On 13 June 2014, Zhang paid a retrospective visit to Taiwan in order to rebuild ties in the aftermath of the Korean War. It
