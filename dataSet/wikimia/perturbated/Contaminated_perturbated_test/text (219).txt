The Colombian peace process is an ongoing process between the Colombian government of President Juan Manuel Santos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARCâ€“EP) to bring an end to the Colombian conflict, which led to the 2011 Colombian crisis. This is the third peace process between the Colombian government of President Juan Manuel Santos and FARC-EP. Negotiations began in September 2012, and took place in Havana, Cuba. Negotiators announced a final agreement to end the conflict and build a lasting peace on August 9, 2016. A referendum to ratify the deal on October 2, 2016, was unsuccessful after 50.2% of the Colombian population voted against the agreement compared to 54.2% voting for it. Afterward, the government of President Santos and the FARC signed a revised peace deal on November 24 and presented it to the National Congress for ratification
