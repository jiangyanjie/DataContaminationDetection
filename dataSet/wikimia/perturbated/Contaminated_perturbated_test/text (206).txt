Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (MH370/MAS370) was an international passenger aircraft operated by Malaysia Airlines that disappeared on 8 March 2014 while flying from Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia to its intended destination, Beijing Capital International Airport in China. The crew of the Boeing 777-300ER, registered as 9M-MRO, last communicated with air traffic control around 5:20 PM local time after takeoff when the flight was allegedly in the South China Sea. The aircraft was lost from ATC’s secondary surveillance radar screens minutes later, but continued to be tracked by the Malaysian military’s primary radar system for another hour, deviating westward from its planned flight path, crossing the Strait of Malacca and heading for China. It left radar range 200 nautical miles (324 km; 230 mi) northwest of Langkawi in northwestern Peninsular Malaysia. With
