The analysis of the datalink between Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and Inmarsat's satellite telecommunication network provide the largest source of information about Flight 370's position and possible in-flight malfunction since it disappeared from military radar coverage around 18:00 Malaysia Standard Time (MYT) on 8 March (1:30 UTC, 7 March), one hour after communication with air traffic controllers ended and the aircraft deviated from its planned flight path while over the South China Sea. Flight 370 was a scheduled commercial flight that carried 189 passengers and 12 crew which departed Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia at 0:41 and was scheduled to land in Xi'an, China at 6:30 China Central Standard Time (6:30 MYT; 22:30 UTC, 7 March). Malaysia has been working in conjunction with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau to co-ordinate the analysis which has also involved the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, Inmarsat, and US National Transportation Safety Board. Other groups have also made attempts to analyse the satellite communications, albeit limited by a lack of publicly available information for several months after the disappearance. On 29 July 2015, debris was discovered on RÃ©union Island which was confirmed to have come from Flight 370; it is the first physical evidence that Flight 370 ended in the Indian Ocean.During flight, the aircraft relies on a datalink with a satellite communication network for data and communications. The satellite datalink connects the aircraft and a ground station via a communications satellite, which translates (changes) the transmission and amplifies the signal; the ground station is connected to other satellite telecommunication networks which allow for messages to be sent to
