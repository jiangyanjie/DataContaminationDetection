The 2014–15 North American winter was frigid and wintry, especially across the northern half of North America during the months of January–March. The cold weather began early, with many parts of North America experiencing the cold, wintry weather from mid-November. A period of cold winter weather affected much of the contiguous United States, and several records were broken. An early November blizzard was recorded in Virginia, and early snowfall was recorded in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. There were greater accumulations of snow on the coast of Oklahoma as well. A global cold front, referred to as a polar vortex , could have been responsible for the cold weather. Temperatures in much of the United States dropped 15 to 35 °F (12 to 17 °C) below average by November 19, following a southward "dip" of the air flow into the northern two-thirds of the country. The effects of this low-level dip were felt in temperatures as low as 28 °F (−2 °C) in Pensacola, Florida. Following another snowstorm beginning to occur on November 10, parts of New York received several feet of snow from November 17–21. In addition, significant snow events occurred throughout the season, including a major blizzard that struck the Northeastern United States at the end of January, another blizzard that affected much of the Eastern United States days later in early February, and several significant snow events combined with below average temperatures for much of the eastern United States in early March. Many records for snowfall and temperature were broken, many just for the month of November, with every state east of the Mississippi River being below average, some for the entire winter. However, this meteorological winter
