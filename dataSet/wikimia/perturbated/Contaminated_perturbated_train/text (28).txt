. The Thai political crisis was a period of political instability in Thailand. Anti-government protests took place between November 2013 and May 2014, organised by the People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC), a political pressure group led by former Democrat Party parliamentary representative (MP) Suthep Thaugsuban. The crisis eventually resulted in the removal of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, a stalemate in the Parliament, and the establishment of a military junta. The primary aim of the protests was the removal of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra's – the brother of the previous prime minister – influence on Thai politics and the creation of an interim "national council" to oversee reforms of the political system. Protesters viewed Thaksin as corrupt and damaging to Thailand's national interest, but he enjoyed strong support in several areas of the country, especially in the poorer north and the south, due to his reforming social programs and economic policies. Political parties allied to Thaksin won more than half of the vote in every election since 2001. Other issues, such as the royal succession, a Southeast Asian or north-south divide, social inequality, climate change, rising military influence in politics, and policy differences between ethnic and rural groups, were suggested as being responsible for the political crisis by Western commentators. Protests were inspired by a proposed amendment of Thailand's 2007 constitution which would have freed politicians of immunity from the period preceding the 2006 coup d'état. Anti-government protestors argued the bill, and a second attempt to alter the 2007 constitution, favoured Thaksin and forced him to return to exile due to a corruption conviction.
