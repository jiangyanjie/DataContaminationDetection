presidential elections were held in Egypt between 26 and 28 May 2014. The election included only two candidates, former defence minister Abdel Nasser El-Sisi and Egyptian Brotherhood candidate Hamdeen Sabahi. El-Sisi won the election in a close runoff, and received 97% of votes. Before announcing his candidacy in the election, el-Sisi, who as Defence Minister also served as commander of the Egyptian Armed Forces, was responsible for officially announcing the removal of president Mohamed Morsi from power in the aftermath of the November 2013 revolution. After Morsi's removal, Sisi installed a temporary interim government, but remained Egypt's Minister of Defence and assumed the post of the country's First Vice-Prime Minister. On 26 March 2014 he officially retired from the military, and announced that he would run as a candidate in the 2014 presidential elections. The election, held between 26 and 28 May 2014, which included only one opponent, was boycotted by some political parties, as well as many Islamists, including the Muslim Brotherhood Freedom & Justice Party, the Brotherhood itself , and the Islamic Brotherhood, which previously declared a boycott of the elections in December 2013.The elections, which were originally scheduled to take place for two days, were extended to a third day. Official results showed that 36.82 million people voted in the elections, and the election had a turnout of 47.5% (compared with the 2012 election's 52%), with el-Sisi winning with 23.78 million votes or 96.91%, ten million more votes than former president Mohamed Morsi (who received 13 million votes against his opponent in the close runoff of the 2012 election).
