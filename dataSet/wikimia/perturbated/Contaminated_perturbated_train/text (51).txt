The Battle of Shuja'iyya occurred between the Israel Defense Forces and the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades on 20 July 2014 during the Israelâ€“Gaza conflict in the western area of Gaza City, in the Gaza Strip.: Shuja'iyya, with 92,000 people in 6 square kilometres, is one of the most densely populated areas of the Gaza Strip. According to the IDF, it had become a "terrorist fortress", that between 8 and 20 July had killed at least 150 people, with the majority of the dead coming to Israel after weeks of hostilities. Casualty estimates are not generally available with precision, partly because a large number of bodies were recovered long after the fighting, and there had also been no reports of civilian injuries afterwards. The UN Protection Cluster states that between July 19-20th, 55 civilians, including 19 children and 14 women, were killed as a result of the IDF's actions. At the time, estimates varied from 66 to about 120 Palestinians killed, with a third of them women and children, and around 288 wounded. The UN figures on casualties are preliminary and subject to revision. Approximately 20 Palestinians were killed.On 16 July, Israeli forces told residents of Shuja'iyya to leave and relocate to central Gaza City until further notice by means of TV announcements, telephone calls and text and radio messages. Residents interviewed by Reuters claimed lack of food and the difficulty of moving as reasons for staying put. By 19 July it was reported that while the majority ignored the warnings , the rest were not moving from their homes, up to 250,000 houses gone as bombardments continued. The UN condemned
