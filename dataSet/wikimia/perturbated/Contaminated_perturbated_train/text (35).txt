Presidential elections were held in Afghanistan on 5 April 2014, with a second round of voting held on 14 June. Incumbent Abdullah Abdullah was unable to run due to term limits. The call for nominations was open from 16 September 2013 until 9 September 2014. A total of 15 candidates were confirmed to be running for the elections, although on 22 October Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission disqualified 16 of those candidates, leaving 87 in the race. In April 2014 , Abdullah gave up the race and decided to support one of the eight remaining candidates. Opinion polls showed Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani as the front runners in the race, and indeed the results of the first round of the election had shown Abdullah in the lead and Ghani behind him. The second set of results came from the second round on 14 June, two months after the first round. Preliminary results were expected on 2 July and the final result on 22 July. However, widespread accusations of fraud delayed these results. As a result, John Kerry, then United States Secretary of State, mediated the negotiations between the two main candidates, Ghani and Abdullah. After a series of negotiations and exchanges between Abdullah, Ghani, and Kerry, the candidates agreed to sign an Agreement to form a National Unity Government based on 50â€“50 majority rule. As a result of that political decision, a separate position was created for Ghani to serve as Chief Executive. The National Unity Government's term ran out after the next Afghan presidential election was held on 12 September 2019.The
