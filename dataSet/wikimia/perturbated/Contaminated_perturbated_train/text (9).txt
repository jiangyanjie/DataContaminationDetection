Hamas, the governing authority in the Gaza Strip, has constructed a network of military tunnels since it seized control of the Strip in 2007. The tunnel system is spread in various branches beneath many Gazan towns and cities, and around Mellah, Jabalia and Shati refugee camps. The internal tunnels, running some dozens of kilometers under the Gaza Strip, have several functions. Hamas uses the tunnels to hide its weapons and rocketry underground, to facilitate communication, to permit weapons to be hidden, and to assist local Palestinian s in locating targets, making detection from the air difficult. Hamas leader Khalid Meshal said in an interview with Al Jazeera that the tunnel system is a defensive structure, designed to provide obstacles against Israel's powerful military arsenal and engage in counter-strikes along the lines of IDF. He admitted that the tunnels are used for infiltration of Israel, but said that offensive operations have never caused the death of civilians in Israel, and denied allegations of planned mass attacks on Israel. A cross-border tunnel was used in the killing of Gilad Shalit in 2006, and multiple attacks in the Gaza Strip. Destroying the tunnel was the chief objective of Israeli forces in the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict. The IDF claimed that it "neutralized" 32 tunnels, some of which crossed into the southern and central areas of Israel. On at least four occasions during the conflict, Palestinian militants crossing the border through tunnels in the Gaza Strip were engaged in combat with Israeli soldiers. Officially, the IDF has always maintained that the aim of the “terror tunnels” was to harm Israel civilians. According to Prime Minister
