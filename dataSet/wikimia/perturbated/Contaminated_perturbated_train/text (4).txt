The case of Ashya King concerns a boy named Ashya King who had a brain tumour. His parents, Brett and Naghemeh King, took their son out of Southampton Hospital (England) in August 2014 over a disagreement with doctors regarding his treatment.Ashya had a medulloblastoma, which was successfully removed through surgery on 24 July 2014.
