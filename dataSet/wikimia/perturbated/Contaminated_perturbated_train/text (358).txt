On 5 May 2014, a yacht and a dinghy, both of which carried refugees and migrants destined for Greece, capsized about four hours off the coast of the Greek island of Sithonia in the Aegean Sea. The vessels had been trying to enter Greece illegally at the time they overturned. The exact cause of the capsizing remains unclear, since weather conditions at the time of the incident could have caused the disaster to take place
