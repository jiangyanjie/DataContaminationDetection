The 2014 European Track Championships was the fifth edition of the elite UEC European Track Championships in track cycling and was held at the Vélodrome Amédée Détraux in Baie-Mahault, Guadeloupe, France, between 16 and 21 September 2014. The Event was organised by the European Cycling Union. All European champions are awarded the European Champion jersey which is worn by the champion throughout the year when competing in the European Track Championships and at other competitions. The programme for the championships was considerably extended, and all World Championship track events were held; seven Olympic events, (sprint, team sprint, keirin, omnium, and time trials for both men and women), six events for which qualification points for the 2016 Summer Olympics were available for the first time, and nine non-Olympic events; the omnium, points race and points races, scratch events, two individual time trials (1000 metres for men, 500 metres for women and 500 metres for men) and two individual pursuits for both genders were held on day one of the championships. The World Championship scratch event was held in its new format for the first time, ending in the points race, rather than the time trial. Unusually, the event was held at a fully outdoor concrete track with a 333-metre circumference, as opposed to the now -standard 180 metre indoor wooden velodromes normally used for such events. As a result, some of the events (team sprints, keirin and points races) were held over non-standard distances. In addition, the event took place outside of continental Europe for the first time, being held in the French -American territory of Guadeloupe.
