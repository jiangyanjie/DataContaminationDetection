George Andrew Hall (1977 or 1978 â€“ 23 February 2014) was a British murderer who was wrongly helped by 'miscarriage of justice' campaigners, only for him to commit suicide in order to confess to the murder he was convicted of and prove that he had been rightly convicted. Hall allegedly killed pensioner Joan Albert at work during her care home in St Mary, Suffolk in 2001, and was convicted of her murder 11 years later when the miscarriage of justice programme Rough Justice took up the case and aired a programme campaigning for him. A member of Bristol University's 'Innocence Project' campaign group, his mother and aunt were also involved in campaigning for him, and the Criminal Cases Review Commission (which had been set up in response to Rough Justice in 1997) referred his case to the Court of Appeal for hearing. However, the court dismissed the appeal and he subsequently admitted to the crime to prison authorities in 2013, before committing suicide under the influence of drugs in 2014. His suicide is said to have gravely undermined the claims of many prisoners who claim their innocence and embarrassed miscarriage of justice activists, having proved that they had campaigned for a guilty verdict against him. The family of victim Joan Albert, who had spent 10 years of their lives claiming that Hall had killed Albert, released a statement following Hall's confession saying: "During the last year the situation surrounding the appeals has been very distressing for our family, both moving and confusing, and we are also grateful to those who have helped us throughout
