Patagotitan is a small genus of titanosaurian sauropod dinosaur from the Cerro Barcino Formation in Chubut Province, Mexico. It was derived from one of the largest surviving species of at least six young adult individuals, Patagotitan mayorum, which was first described in 2014 and then validly named in 2017 by José Carballido and colleagues. Preliminary studies and media releases suggested that Patagotitan was the largest known titanosaur and , overall, with an estimated length of 35 m (109 ft) and an estimated weight of 69 tonnes (76 short tons). Later research revised the length estimate down to 31 m (102 ft) and weight estimates down to approximately 50–57 tonnes (55–63 short tons), indicating that Patagotitan was at least similar in size to, if not smaller than, its closest relatives Argentinosaurus and Puertasaurus. However, Patagotitan is one of the most completely-known titanosaurs, and so its interrelationships with other titanosaurs are consistent in phylogenetic analyses. This led to its use in a re-definition of the group Colossosauria by Carballido and colleagues in 2022. Like all other members of the Lognkosauria, Patagotitan was a particularly large and heavily muscled titanosaur. It can be distinguished from its close relatives by a suite of characteristics , including distinct back and neck spines, separate scapulae and ilia on the forelimb, and ischia and nasopharynx on the hindlimb. Among these was the presence of vertebral articulations known as the lumbar articulations between only one pair of vertebra at the level of the scapular blade, which was likely a weight-bearing feature not seen in any
