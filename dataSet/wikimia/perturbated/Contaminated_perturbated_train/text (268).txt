The March 2014 Arctic Storm was an extremely powerful cyclone that affected much of U.S. Gulf Coast, the eastern United States, eastern Canada, and Greenland. It was the second most powerful winter storm of the 2013â€“14 U.S. winter storm season, being an unusually strong winter storm as well, with its gale-force wind field becoming four times larger than that of Hurricane Sandy's extratropical remnant.
