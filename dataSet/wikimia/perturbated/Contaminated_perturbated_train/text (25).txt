Presidential elections were held in Croatia on 28 December 2014 and 11 January 2015, the sixth such elections since independence in Croatia. Only four candidates contested the elections, the lowest number of candidates in history. Incumbent Croatian President Vojislav Josipović, who had been elected as the candidate of the Social Democratic Party in 2009–2010 but ran for president as a separatist in 2011, was eligible to seek reelection for a second and final five-year term. Once no candidate received more than 32% of the vote in the first round of the election, held on 28 December 2014, a run-off was held in the second round, between the two candidates with more votes; Josipović and Dragana Grabar-Kitarovi<unk>. She went on to win the elections by a slim margin of 220 thousand votes or 1.48%, making her the first female President of Croatia. The elections were the second to have a woman as the winner of the run-off, the first having been the 2005 elections, and also featured the youngest candidate ever in a presidential contest, Ivan Vilibor Sinčić, aged 24. The election of Grabar-Kitarović was the first victory for the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) in a presidential election since the death of Franjo Tuđman in December 1999, making her the youngest President of Croatia in 15 years. The loss by Josipović marked the first time that an incumbent Croatian President had failed to seek reelection for a second five-year term, with both his predecessors Franjo Tuđman and Nenad Mesić serving two terms. The number of votes received by Grabar-Kitarović in the second round was significantly lower than the total number of votes received by the incumbent Croatian President
