The Summer of Logic was a scientific event in the summer of 2014, comprising nine major conferences and several workshops, in the fields of mathematical logic, logic in computer science, and logic in artificial intelligence. The meetings took place from July 9 to 24, 2014, and attracted more than 2000 participants and researchers.The event was organized by the Gödel Society in collaboration with the Karlsruhe University of Technology. Member conferences include:In the Logic in Computer Science stream (representing the Federated Logic Conference (FLoC)): International Conference on Computer Aided Verification (CAV) IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF) International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP) International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP) Joint meeting of the EACSL Annual Conference on Computational Logic (CSL) and the ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (SLSC) International Conference on Techniques for Software Testing (RTA) joint with the 2015 Conference on Typed Lambda Calculi for Logic Cases International Conference on Methods and Applications of Satisfiability Testing (MTSA) More than 70 FLoC workshops FLoC Olympic Games (and subsequent competitions) SAT/SMT Summer SchoolIn the Mathematical Logic stream: Logic Colloquium 2014 (LC) Logic, Algebra and Truth Degrees 2014 (LATD) Two Games in Logic (GeTFun 2.0) The Infinity Workshop (INFINITY) Workshop on Logic and Games (LG) Workshop on Nonclassical Turing Algorithm Applications and Tools (NFTA) Kurt Gödel Fellowship CompetitionIn the Logic in Computer Science stream: International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) International Workshop on Description Logics (DL) International Workshop on Natural and Motif Reasoning (NMR) International Workshop on
