The Willis Resilience Expedition was a scientific and exploratory expedition that took place in Antarctica from November 2012 through January 2014, with the goal of a better understanding of changes in the Earth's climate brought on by global warming in addition to weather-related risk. Starting in August 2013, the expedition was led by Douglas Stoup and Parker Liautaud, a polar explorer and environmental campaigner. The expedition was underwritten by the Willis Group, a global risk management and research company. The communications team, including driver and mechanic Eyjo Furteitsson, expedition coordinator Nathan Rossi, and crew leader Paddy Scott, were part of the team in the 6x6 expedition truck built especially for the expedition by Arctic Industries, which consisted of four people. The project team will continue to research and perform an isotope transect of Antarctica by collecting samples on which stable isotope analysis will be conducted in the hope of providing a valuable contribution to human understanding of Antarctic climate and potential for climate change. Speed Record Attempt. Parker Liautaud successfully attempted to ski and fly unsupported from the coast of Antarctica to the South Pole in 2014, setting a “coast to Pole” speed record. At 19 years old, he also broke the record for becoming the youngest person to cross both the North and the South Poles. Live Video. The Willis Resilience Expedition was supported by a custom-built 6x6 truck outfitted with equipment that provided Internet connectivity to the rest of the expedition team. Paddy Scott, Arctic Industries' team leader, worked with a cameraman and photographer to document Liautaud and Stoup's journey in real time.
