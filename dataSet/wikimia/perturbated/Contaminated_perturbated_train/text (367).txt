The 2014 Burkina Faso Uprisings were a series of demonstrations and riots in Burkina Faso in October 2014 that quickly spread to other parts of West Africa. They were in response to attempts at changing the constitution to allow President Blaise Compaor√© to run for re-election and extend his 27 year term of office. Pressure for political change came from all segments of society, but in particular from the country's youth.
