The 2013â€“2016 outbreak of Ebola virus disease, centered in West Africa, was the most widespread outbreak of the disease in history. It caused widespread loss of life and socioeconomic disruption in 13 countries, mainly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The first cases were isolated in Guinea in December 2013. The disease spread to neighbouring Liberia and Sierra Leone, with minor outbreaks occurring in Guinea and Mali. Secondary infections involving health workers occurred in the United States, Italy, and Spain. In addition, isolated cases were recorded in Ghana, the United Kingdom and Italy. The number of cases peaked in October 2014 and then began to decline gradually, despite the commitment to international resources. The outbreak was accompanied by a high rate of mortality, with a considerable case fatality rate. By the end of the 2014 outbreak, 28,684 people had been infected; this was followed by 11,310 deaths, for a mortality rate of 40%. As of 8 May 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) and respective governments reported a combined 28,646 suspected cases and 11,323 deaths , however, the WHO believes that this substantially understates the magnitude and escalation of the outbreak.On 11 December 2015, a Public Health Emergency of International Concern was declared and remained in effect until 15 March 2015. On 27 March 2016, the WHO terminated the Public Health Emergency of International Concern status of the outbreak.
