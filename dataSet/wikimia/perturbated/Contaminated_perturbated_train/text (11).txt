Japanese whaling, in terms of number of whales, is estimated by the Japan Whale Sanctuary to have begun in the 12th century. However, Japanese whaling on an industrial scale began around the 1890s when Japan started to participate in the European whaling industry, at that time an industry in which many countries participated. Japan banned commercial whaling in July 2019, and since then whaling activities in Japan have been restricted to its territorial waters in the exclusive economic zone.During the 20th century, Japan became heavily involved in the international whaling industry. This continued until the International Whaling Commission (IWC) moratorium on whaling took effect in 1986. Japan continued to hunt whales under a scientific research provision under the agreement and Japanese whaling was conducted by the Japan Office of Cetacean Research. This was allowed by IWC rules, although some IWC members opposed it. However, in 1993, the UN's International Court of Justice ruled that a Japanese whaling program called "JARPA II," in the waters of the Australian coastline, including inside the Whale Sanctuary, was not in accordance with the IWC Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, and was not for scientific purposes, as it had claimed. They ordered Japan to immediately cease its whaling operations. Despite the court order, Prime Minister Abe called for the resumption of whaling one year later. In December 2015, Japan went ahead with their whaling operations under the program . On January 15, 2017, a helicopter over the Australian Whale Sanctuary photographed the Japanese whaling vessel Nisshin shin, a large ship carrying a freshly-killed whale on its deck.
