The protests (Khmer: បាតុកម្មប្រឆាំងរាជរដ្ឋាភិបាល) are a series of large-scale street protests in Cambodia from July 2013 to January 2014. Popular demonstrations in Phnom Penh took place to protest the removal of the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen, triggered by widespread allegations of electoral fraud during the general election of 2013. Demands to raise the minimum income by at least 20 percent per month and resentment at Vietnamese influence in Cambodia also contributed to protests. The main opposition party, the Cambodian Democratic Party, refused to participate in any of the elections, and major demonstrations took place across the country. A protest on 17 January 2014 led to the deaths of 4 people and the destruction of the main protest camp.Cambodian protests may have been partly precipitated by the perception of corruption, lack of political transparency, and poor quality of healthcare in the country. Cambodia is near the bottom of international rankings in each of those factors. Inequality in the distribution of wealth is a recognized problem, as is the statistic that a third of children are malnourished, and the difficulty that journalists in Cambodia face when they are rounded up and detained on dubious charges.Cambodia's strongman Hun Sen has affirmed his 'pre-eminence' by closing Freedom Park, an opposition protest site in central Phnom Penh. The site is now strictly off limits to journalists, and appears to be like a 'fortified military base'. Cambodians are increasingly concerned about land grabs, corruption and labor unrest in a country 'ruled by one person for nearly three decades.' Freedom Park, is closed now indefinitely. Protests have continued out of desperation, with protesters voicing their opposition to the crackdown
