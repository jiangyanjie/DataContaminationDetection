Conversely, Hamas' attacks aimed to bring international pressure on Israel with the strategic goal of forcing the latter to lift the Israeli–Egyptian blockade of the Gaza Strip; among its other goals were thwarting Israel's military offensive, seeking an international tribunal to monitor Israel's compliance with a ceasefire, freeing political prisoners and end Israel's isolation.
