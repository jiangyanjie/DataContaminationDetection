Talking Statues is a project created initially in 2013 by David Peter Fox in Copenhagen, Denmark involving pre-recorded voiceovers in a statue or statues available in a smartphone app. The statue of Hans Christian Andersen in the King's Garden in Copenhagen was the first talking statue in the world. Later the idea was applied in Helsinki, New York, San Diego, Chicago, Vilnius, Milan, Berlin, Manchester, and others. The project works with mobile phones activated through a QR code found on the statue, when you scan this QR code, you will be called. You can also download our app, with which you can find the Talking Statues in the world and have access to our map. We have also connected with the statue so the project is able to call you on your phone when you get close to a statue. The project started in Kings Garden in Copenhagen, where Fox accompanied his two children Alfred and Leah to the statues. On their visit they passed the many statues, one of the most famous was H. C. Andersen, who became the first talking statue in the world launched on 13th of September 2013. In connection with the first project a leaflet by the artist Mathilde Lunderskov was made that provided a map of the 10 Talking Statues. The monologues were written by film director Rudolf Hansen together with David Peter Fox and the app is made by actor Leah Maurer sen. The first project was overseen from the start by Jens Peter Munk from the Municipality, who has written several book on these statues in Copenhagen. The project of 2013 was supported by the Municipality of Copenhagen
