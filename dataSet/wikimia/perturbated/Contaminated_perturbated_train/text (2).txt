Hurricane Ana was the second tropical cyclone of the season to threaten the U.S. state of Hawaii with a direct hit, after Iselle in August. The twenty-first named and fifteenth hurricane of the 2014 Pacific hurricane season, Ana formed from a disturbance that formed in the central Pacific at the end of September. It rapidly consolidated, and a tropical depression had developed by October 13. Aided by tropical depression force winds, it strengthened moving westward, threatening to pass over the chain of Hawaii once or several times as indicated by early forecasts. By October 17, it had strengthened to a hurricane south of Japan, and reached its closest approach to Hawaii shortly afterwards , making its closest contact in November. The hurricane gradually weakened and began to fluctuate in strength as it moved to the northwest and eventually northeast as it moved to the north. It approached the western Pacific Ocean, moved north toward the southwest along a ridge and interacted with a cold front before becoming a hurricane briefly again on October 21. Ana transitioned into a tropical cyclone on October 26, and moved through the northwest Pacific before becoming a tropical storm on October 28 after it came ashore in Western Canada. Although Ana was originally forecasted to strike the chain of Hawaii early in December, tropical storm watches and warnings were issued in advance of the storm. These were later removed and could have affected nearly the whole state of Hawaii, as Ana nudged more to the north than forecasted. At its closest approach, Ana dropped heavy rain of nearly up to 18 inches , although the heaviest hit missed Hawaii by nearly 20 miles (32 km),
