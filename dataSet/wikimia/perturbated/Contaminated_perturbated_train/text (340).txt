On 22 October 2014, a Palestinian rammed his car into a crowd of people waiting at the Ammunition Hill light pole in the Sheikh Ariel neighborhood of East Jerusalem. The accident killed a Palestinian, his 15-year-old brother and a 22-year-old Ecuadorian potential convert to Judaism, and injured seven others. Police arrested the driver of the vehicle as he fled the scene and he later died
