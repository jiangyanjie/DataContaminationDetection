It has resulted in more than a thousand warrants for arrest of persons of various types. According to the Operation Car Wash task force, the case could implicate the executives of the state oil company Petrobras, politicians from Brazil's largest parties, federal presidents (in the Federal Republic), presidents of the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate, state governors, and politicians from the largest public companies. The Federal Police consider it the most ambitious investigation of corruption in the country's history. The taskforce was officially disbanded on 1 April 2021.Originally a money laundering case, it expanded to cover allegations of corruption at Petrobras, where executives allegedly accepted bribes to get contracts in exchange for awarding contracts to companies that were selling oil at inflated prices. This criminal scheme was initially known as Petrolão (Portuguese : "petrol oil") because of the Petrobras scandal. The investigation is called "Operation Car Wash" because it was first uncovered at a car wash in Curitiba. The goal of the investigation was to expose the full extent of the money laundering scheme, estimated by the Regional Superintendent of the Federal Police of Paraná State in 2015 at R$6.4–42.8 billion (US$4.7 billion), largely through the embezzlement of Petrobras funds.: 60 60 The investigations included more than a thousand warrants for arrest, seizure, temporary and preventive detention, and extradition against business leaders and politicians in numerous parties.
