, elections were held in Costa Rica in February 2014 to elect a new president, four vice presidents, and a new National Assembly. In accordance with Article 132 of the Constitution, incumbent President Laura Chinchilla Miranda was ineligible to run for a second consecutive term.The ruling National Centrist Party put forward San José Mayor Johnny Araya Monge as its presidential candidate; the moderate Front Nacional party fielded local legislator Otto Guevara; the leftist Broad Front nominated José María Villalta Florez-Estrada; and the center-left Libertarian Libertad nominated Luis Guillermo Solís Rivera. Opinion polls in December 2013 showed Araya leading the race at 34 percent, Villalta close behind at 32 percent, Guevara at 15 percent, and Solís trailing at eight percent, increasing the likelihood of a run-off vote in February. Villalta's strong showing in the polls caused great concern among his own supporters and business leaders in the country. La Nacion, Costa Rica's most important newspaper and a historical ally of the Front Nacional, began a concerted series of attacks against Araya, comparing him to Venezuela's Hugo Chávez. Political observers have concluded that this focus on Chávez actually helped Luis Villalta succeed in the election.In the presidential election, Solís and Araya came first and second, respectively, with neither candidate reaching 40 percent of the valid poll in the first round of voting, so a second round of voting was held from 8pm on 2 April until 6pm on 6 April, the first in that period since 2002.In a surprise move, Araya announced on 6 March that he would abandon his plans to run in the run-off election.
