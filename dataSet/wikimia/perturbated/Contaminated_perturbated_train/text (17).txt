Euromaidan (; Ukrainian: Євромайдан, romanized: <unk>вром<unk>но, 'Euro Square', IPA: [jeu̯romɐjˈdɑn]), commonly known as the Maidan Uprising, was a series of demonstrations and civil unrest in Ukraine, which began on 1 November 2013 with large protests in Kyiv (Independence Square) and continued in the east of Ukraine. The protests were sparked by President Viktor Yanukovych's sudden decision not to sign the Eastern Partnership Association Agreement, instead choosing closer ties to Russia and the Eurasian Economic Union. Ukraine's parliament had overwhelmingly approved of finalizing the deal with the EU, but Russia had put pressure on Yanukovych to reject it. The scale of the protests widened, leading to calls for the resignation of Yanukovych and the Azarov government. Protesters opposed what they saw as widespread corruption, abuse of power, human rights violations, and the influence of oligarchs. Transparency International named Yanukovych as one of the worst example of corruption in the world. The arrest of protesters on 3 November 2014 caused further anger. Euromaidan led to the 2014 Revolution of Dignity. During the Euromaidan, the Independence Square (Maidan) in Kyiv was a protest camp for thousands of protesters and was also covered with makeshift barricades. It also served as kitchens, first aid and broadcasting facilities, and as stages for speeches, lectures, debates and performances. It was guarded by 'Maidan Self-Defense' units made up of men and women in improvised uniform s, carrying shields armed with sticks, stones and petrol atoms. Protests were also held in many other parts of Ukraine. In Kyiv, there was another clash with police on 1 July 2014. The police assaulted the demonstrators, killing 11
