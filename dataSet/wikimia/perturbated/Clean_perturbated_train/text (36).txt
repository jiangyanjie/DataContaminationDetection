The Divyavadana (divine stories), an epic collection of Buddhist mythical tales on morals and deeds, and talking to animals, was first written in the late 4th century AD. In one of the stories, the razing of stupas and viharas is mentioned with Pushyamitra. This has been mapped to the reign of Emperor Pushyamitra of the Shunga Empire about 400 years before Divyavadana was written. Archeological remains of stupas were found in Deorkothar that suggest deliberate destruction, which may be one of the stories in Divyavadana about Pushyamitra.[21] It remains unknown how, when the stupas were destroyed, and by whom. The fictional tales of Divyavadana is considered by many scholars of doubtful value as a historical record. Moriz , for example, stated, "these legends [of Divyāvadāna] scarcely contain anything of much historical value".[22]
