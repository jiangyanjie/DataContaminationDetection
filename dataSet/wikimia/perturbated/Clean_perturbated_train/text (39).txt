The war began with attacks by the RSF on government sites as airstrikes, heavy bombing and gunfire were reported across the Sudan. The cities of Khartoum and Omdurman were divided between the two warring factions, with al-Burhan relocating his government to Port Sudan as RSF forces captured most of Khartoum's government buildings. Attempts by major powers to negotiate a ceasefire culminated in the mediated negotiations in Jeddah in May 2023, but this did not stop violence and was ultimately abandoned.[32]
