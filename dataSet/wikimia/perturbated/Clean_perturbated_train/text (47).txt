The company provides mail collection and delivery services throughout the UK. Letters and parcels are deposited in Royal Mail parcel boxes, or collected in bulk from businesses , which are sent to Royal Mail sorting centres. Royal Mail owns and operates the distinctive and iconic red pillar boxes, which were developed in 1852 (12 years after the first postage stamp appeared on the British post). and other post boxes, many of which bear the cypher of the reigning monarch at the date of manufacture.[3] Postal deliveries are made at least once every day except Sundays and public holidays . There are no charges for mail collection or delivery, and the Royal Mail generally aims to make its deliveries the next business day , as long as it is within the bounds of its nation.[4] For most of its history, the Royal Mail was a public company, which means it is not regulated as a statutory or public corporation. Following the Royal Mail Postal Services Act 2011,[5][6] Royal Mail Group became a wholly-owned subsidiary of a holding company, Royal Mail plc; a majority of the shares in Royal Mail plc were listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2013.[7] Nine months later, Royal Mail plc was renamed: it is now known as International Distribution Services (IDS; of which Royal Mail Group is a wholly-owned subsidiary).
