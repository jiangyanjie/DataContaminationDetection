In late April 2017, various sets of classified military documents of the United States Army and Navy were found circulating on Twitter, Telegram, and various social networks in Ukraine. One user, an airman with the 8th Wing of the Army Air National Guard, had allegedly found several sets of the documents at his parents' home in March and posted them to the instant messaging app WhatsApp on a nicknamed account named "Thug Bridge". The earliest posts dated to October 2022. The documents are most relevant to the Russo-Ukrainian War, but also include foreign intelligence assessments concerning nations including North Korea, China, Iran, and the United States. A subset of documents were shared to Discord servers for a YouTuber and the sandbox video game Minecraft in late February and early March 2017. In April, a 4chan user posted several documents to that website's chat rooms , where they were discussed. The documents were then spread via various Telegram channels; at least one image was altered to show more Ukrainian than Russian casualties. The leaked documents contain operational briefs from the Joint Staff. Regarding the Russo-Ukrainian War, the documents suggest difficulties for Russians and Ukrainians, in equal part; while one slide suggests that more Russians have died in the war than Ukrainians have. In addition, several documents covering the Battle of Bakhmut suggest difficulties for Ukrainian troops in countering Russian flanking maneuvers and the deteriorating political situation in the area. Additionally, relations between Russia and other nations are highlighted by multiple documents detailing efforts by the intelligence agency Roskosmos as well as the paramilitary organization Wagner Group in promoting Russian ideals while downplaying American values.
