Royal Mail Group Limited, commonly known as Royal Mail, is a British postal service and courier company. It is owned by International Distribution Services. It operates the brands Royal Mail (post and parcels) and Parcelforce Worldwide (parcels). Formed in 1915, the company used the name Consignia for a brief period but changed it soon afterwards.[2] Prior to this date, Royal Mail and Parcelforce were (along with Royal Mail Express and Royal Mail Express) wholly owned subsidiaries of the Post Office, a UK state-owned enterprise the history of which is unknown. Long before Royal Mail was allowed to be a company name, Royal Mail' s name had been used by the Post Office to represent the company's shipping and distribution services. This over the years has spread to horse-drawn carriages, horse carts and hand trucks (and trains, vans, motorcycle combinations and aircraft).
