A motion of no confidence in the Spanish government of Pedro S치nchez was tabled by the far-right Vox party on 1 February 2023 and will be debated and voted in the Chamber of Deputies between 21 and 22 March 2023. It was the first motion of no confidence filed since the country's transformation into an open democracy.Vox announced the motion of no confidence on 1 February 2022, proposing it to be tabled by a candidate with experience, voicing that S치nchez's proposed reforms of the decree-law , the criminal procedure and the sedition sentences were destined for a "self-coup" similar to "that of Pedro Castillo in Peru" many decades earlier. The opposition People's Party (PP) under Felipe Feij칩o stated that it would vote against the motion, unlike the 2020 vote, but it did not clarify whether it would abstain or vote in favour of it .After the motion had been awaiting a period in which Vox was unable to secure the consent of all the parliamentary bodies it applied for, on 1 February 2023 the party sought to secure the approval of the court and asked attorney and former politician Ram칩n Tamames, aged 89, to lead the motion. Tamames accepted on 21 February, the motion's vote announced for the next Monday. His speech highlights the maneuvers against the separation of powers towards "an oligarchy and autocracy" with abuse of the decree-law, elimination of the crime of sedition or reduction of sentences for embezzlement, support in pro-independence and conciliatory line of government, partisan manipulation of history, attacks on legal aid and the right to free speech of foreign businessmen
