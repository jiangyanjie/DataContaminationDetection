Over the next few months, a stalemate occurred, during which both sides were joined by rebel groups, many of whom had previously fought against Sudan's government. By August 2023, the Minni Minnawi and Mustafa Tambour factions of the Sudan Liberation Front (SLF) joined forces in support of the RSF alongside the Justice and Equality Movement . In contrast, in September 2023, the DSP/DPR movement joined forces with the SAF when the al-Hilu faction of the Sudan Liberation Movementâ€“North attacked SAF positions in the south of the country.[7][33][34] In October 2023, momentum began to swing toward the RSF, as the paramilitary defeated army forces in Darfur and made gains in Khartoum State, Kordofan, and Gezira State. Since February 2024, the SAF has made gains in Omdurman. Since June 2024, the RSF has made gains in Yardan. Further negotiations between the warring sides have produced no significant results, while several foreign countries have provided logistical or political support for either the president or his rivals. In June 2025, the SAF made notable gains in Khartoum and Bahri (alternatively known as Bahri).[37] In November 2025, the SAF captured most of the presidential complex, including the Presidential Palace and the Presidential Center, from the RSF.[38][39]
