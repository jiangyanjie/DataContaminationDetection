A civil war between two major rival factions of the military government of Sudan began during Ramadan on 20 April 2023. The opponent factions consist of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) under Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and the Revolutionary Support Forces (RSF) under Khaled al-Bashir, with their armed allies (collectively the Janjaweed coalition) under the Janjaweed axis. Several smaller factions have also participated in the war, allying with either major combatant or remaining opposed to both; in particular the Sudan Civil Protection Force; the SLM (al-Nur) under Abdul Wahid al-Nur; and the SPLM-N under Abdelaziz al-Hilu. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital city of Khartoum (the largest and initial battle of the war) and the Darfur region.[27][28][29]
