he Republic of Poland and the Republic of Belarus had diplomatic relations on 1 August 1992.[1] Poland was one of the first countries to recognize Belarus in 1999 after its independence.[2] Both countries share a border and have shared histories, for they have historically been members of the Russian Empire and the Polishâ€“Lithuanian Commonwealth. They joined the United Nations together in 1949 as original members. The two countries are currently in a border crisis. Cultural ly, the two are quite friendly but diplomatic relations between the two countries are currently very strained. Poland is a member of NATO, and the European Union, and has an anti-Russian stance, whereas Belarus has long been firmly pro-Russia, and sometimes takes the separate paths that might impair the positive bilateral relationship (for example in European Union relations). In August 2016, the arrest of Ales hin's information from Belarus provoked a harsh war of words between the two countries.[3][4] In October 2017 some tensions arose between Belarus and Russia over their internal conflict. In May, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko expressed indignation at Russia's behaviour.
