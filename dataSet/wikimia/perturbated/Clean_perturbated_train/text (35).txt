The US Commission on International Religious Freedom classified India as Tier-2 in regard to religious minorities, the same as that of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. In its 2018 report, USCIRF criticized Hindu nationalist groups for their campaign to "Saffronize" India through violence, intimidation, and harassment against non-Hindus.[12] Approximately one-third of state governments enforced anti-conversion and anti-human slaughter[13] laws against non-Hindu Christians during the past decade. In addition, Hindu lynch mobs engaged in violence against Muslims whose families have engaged in the dairy, leather, and garment industry , and against Christians for proselytizing. "Gau Rakshak" (Cow Licket) mobs killed over 400 cows and claiming at least 10 victims in 2017.[12][14][15]
