The 2023 Pacific typhoon season was significantly less active than the 2018 Atlantic and Caribbean season and became the third-most inactive season in history in terms of named storms, with just three storms developing, only ahead of 2010 and 1998, however it had a slightly above average in terms of ACE. Despite the season occurring during the period of El Ni√±o which typically favors activity in the basin, activity was abnormally low. This was primarily due to a consistent period of negative PDO, which typically discourages tropical storm formation in the subtropics. The season was also notably shorter than the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season in terms of the number of developed storms, becoming only the fourth such season on record, after 2005, 2010 and 2020. The season's number of developed storms also did not exceed that of the Pacific hurricane season of 2008, though ten storms developed, with many of those developing further into super cells. In Southeast Asia , the season was very destructive, primarily due to Typhoon Doksuri which devastated the northern Philippines, Taiwan, and China in July, becoming the costliest typhoon on record as well as the second costliest typhoon to hit mainland China, and Typhoon Haiyan in September, which devastated China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. The season was less active in Vietnam, with no tropical storms making landfall in mainland Vietnam (the third such season since the country's independence, after the 1981 and 1988 seasons).
