Tropical Cyclone Cheneso was a strong tropical cyclone that affected northern Madagascar and southern Madagascar on 20 January 2023. The fourth tropical storm to strengthen into a tropical storm in the 2022â€“23 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Cheneso developed out of a tropical disturbance of disturbed weather status which was first monitored at night on 17 January. Despite convection wrapping into the tropical pattern, the system formed into a subtropical depression on 18 January. The depression strengthened into Severe Tropical Storm Cheneso on the following day. Cheneso struck over northern Madagascar and weakened into an inland depression, before the system passed into the Mozambique Channel. Cheneso later strengthened into a tropical cyclone on 25 January. The system continued moving southeast, before transitioning into a tropical hurricane on 29 January. The National Office for Risk
