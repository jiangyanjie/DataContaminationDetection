Triangle Derby I was the first annual major pinball tournament event promoted by World Wonder Ring Stardom under the "Triangle Derby" branch. It took place between January 3 and March 4, 2019, and had limited attendance due to the fact that it was the only event promoted in 2019 in addition to the COVID-19 which took place at the time (until January 30). It also represented the first major event promoted by Stardom in 2023.
