on Friday, heavy tensions broke out between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, which have led to several alleged attacks by Congolese and Rwandan forces on each other's territory. Rwandan forces have been caught crossing into the DRC multiple times, usually fighting alongside Congolese rebels. The crisis is related to a rebel offensive beginning in March 2022 by the March 23 Movement (M23), which the Congo and the United Nations accuse Rwanda of not only supporting but actively fighting for. Rwanda and the Congo have been accused in the past of working together with the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), a racist , violent, and paramilitary group formed as part of the M23 initial offensive in late March 2022. Both the Congo and Rwanda deny they support the FDLR and M23,
