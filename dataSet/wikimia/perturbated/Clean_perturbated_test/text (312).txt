The DFB-Pokal Final will decide the winner of the 2022–23 DFB-Pokal, the 80th season of the annual German football cup competition. The match will be played on February 5 at the Olympiastadion . The winner will host the 2023 edition of the DFL-Supercup at the start of the following season, where they will face the champion of the 2022–23 edition of the Bundesliga. It can also occur that the same team wins the Bundesliga and the DFB-Pokal, completing a double. However, in this case, the winner of the Bundesliga will take the place of the host instead. The winner of the DFB-Pokal has automatic automatic qualification into the group stage of the 2023–24 edition of the UEFA Europa League. However, if the winner has already entered Europe’s top club competition, the team will not be automatically qualified for the 2023–24 edition of the UEFA
