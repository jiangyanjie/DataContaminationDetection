World news or international news or world coverage is the news media jargon of news from abroad, about a country or a person. For journalism, it is a branch that covers news , whether published or cited by publishers, broadcasters or news agencies, or – more recently – information that is transmitted or researched through distance media such as telephone, satellite TV or the internet. Although the world coverage aspect of the news media field is not usually considered a specific specialization , it is well-known in almost all the world. Particularly in the United States, there is a blurred distinction between world news and "national" news , which include directly news about the US government or national institutions, such as wars in which the US are involved
