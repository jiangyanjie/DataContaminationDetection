Cold Water Flat was an American folk rock band formed in 1990 by Paul Janovitz (vocals and guitar), Tony Silva (bass) and Bob Harding (drums) after the trio graduated from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Paul Janovitz is the younger brother of Bill Janovitz, lead singer and songwriter of Salt River. They began playing shows in Boston before Janovitz moved to New Jersey. The group nearly split up, but their record label Once Again Sam offered to release an album, so the band formed. In 1999, Cold Water Flat signed with MCA , which released a self-titled second album, recorded at Fort Apache Studios, but despite getting some airplay on US college radio stations the band did not reach a wider audience. Soon after the group disbanded, Janovitz left Cold Water Flat to join Dragstrip
