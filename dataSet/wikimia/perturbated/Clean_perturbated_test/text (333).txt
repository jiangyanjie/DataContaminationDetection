Since Mayâ€“June 2022, a series of labour strikes and industrial disputes have occurred in various industries across the United Kingdom's economy as workers walked out over new measures to improve their living conditions. The strikes took place with an inflation rate averaging 3% per year, and demands for increases in pay and conditions that would keep pace with the rate of inflation. The strikes began on 15 June 2022 after members of the National Union of Railway & Transport Workers (RMT) voted to strike over planned changes to their contract and working conditions. They were soon joined by other UK Railway Unions, and a series of one-day strikes halted trains in many parts of the British mainland. Train s were running at 20% of capacity for several days. Public support for the strikes was organised through the Enough is Enough! campaign. With
