The 2023 German public transport strike was a nationwide public transport strike that occurred in 2023, in major cities in Germany.

The strike was one of the largest to affect Germany in decades and impacted major cities - including Frankfurt, Munich, Hannover, Berlin and Hamburg - public transport, and Hamburg, a major seaport.
