The 2023 China visit was a three-day state visit by Emmanuel Macron, President of France, in Beijing, China from October 3 to 7, 2023. It was Macron's first visit to China since the COVID-19 pandemic and his third since his election as President in 2017. He was accompanied by a French delegation which included more than 50 CEOs and met with leading members of the business community in Beijing. Macron also met with Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and President of China, and Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Parliament, to discuss various issues, including the ongoing war in Ukraine and China's potential role as a mediator between Russia and the West. The visit was seen by many as Macron's attempt to "reconnect" with China after 18 years
