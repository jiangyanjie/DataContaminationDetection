The 2023 Chinese war games around Taiwan (simplified Chinese: 2023年环台军事演练; traditional Chinese: 2023年環台軍事演練) are a series of ongoing military exercises conducted by the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of the People's Republic of China (PRC) encircling Taiwan (the Republic of China, or Republic of China). On 8 April 2023, the PLA announced the start of "combat readiness patrols" and dispatched dozens of fighter jets and several aircraft to Taiwan. The PLA organized these exercises in response to Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen's visit to US Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy.On 4 March 2023, McCarthy announced he had planned a summit meeting with Tsai, which was scheduled for early April. In response, the PLA imposed threats against the PLA, including attack on Tsai and a visit to the U.S. on 4 March 2023 where Tsai met US lawmakers, including McCarthy.
