The Electoral Commission (An Coimisiún Toghcháin) is an independent body with responsibility for the oversight of electoral processes in Ireland, including electoral operations, constituency reviews and process checks. It was established in 2023. Prior to its establishment, some of these functions had been carried out by government departments, statutory agencies and components of the electoral system; other functions are novel to the Commission.
