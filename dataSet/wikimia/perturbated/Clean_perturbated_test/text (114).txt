On 26 February 2023, an unidentified person fatally shot two Israeli settlers in their car in Huwara, about 40 km east of Nablus in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Since the shooting, the suspects have carried out revenge attacks on Palestinians, which have killed at least one Palestinian and injured around 100 others. On 7 March, one 49-year-old suspect was killed during an attack on three Palestinians crossing into Jenin.
