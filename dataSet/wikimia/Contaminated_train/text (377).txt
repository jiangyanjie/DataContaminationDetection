The GSK China scandal was an imbroglio where the China branch of the global drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) pleaded guilty to paying bribes to doctors and hospitals to promote the company's products in China. The scandal started with sex tapes of the company's China head, Mark Reilly and his Chinese girlfriend at a Shanghai department, which were sent to several senior executives of the company.
