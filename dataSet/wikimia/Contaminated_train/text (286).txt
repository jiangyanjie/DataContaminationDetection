Around midday on October 22, 2014, a passing motorist saw an Asian woman walking north along the Ingraham Trail on the outskirts of Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Several days later, after seeing stories in the local media that 45-year old Atsumi Yoshikubo (吉窪昌美) who had been visiting the city from her home in southern Japan, had gone missing, she reported the sighting.
