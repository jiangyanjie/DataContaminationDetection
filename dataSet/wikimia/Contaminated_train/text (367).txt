The 2014 Burkina Faso uprising was a series of demonstrations and riots in Burkina Faso in October 2014 that quickly spread to multiple cities. They began in response to attempts at changing the constitution to allow President Blaise Compaor√© to run again and extend his 27 years in office. Pressure for political change came from civil society and in particular from the country's youth.
