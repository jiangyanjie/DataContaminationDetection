The Willis Resilience Expedition was a scientific and exploratory program that took place in Antarctica from November 2013 to January 2014, with the goal of a better understanding of changes in the Earth's climate brought on by global warming in addition to weather-related risk. Announced in August 2013, the expedition was led by explorer Douglas Stoup and Parker Liautaud, a teenage polar adventurer and environmental campaigner. The expedition was underwritten by Willis Group, a global risk advisor, insurance and reinsurance broker. The communications team, including driver and mechanic Eyjo Furteitsson, communication manager Nathan Hambrook-Skinner, and cinematographer Paddy Scott trailed the team in the 6x6 expedition truck built especially for the expedition by Arctic Trucks.The expedition consisted of three main components: Science. Liautaud and Stoup conducted an isotope transect of Antarctica by collecting snow samples on which stable isotope analysis will be conducted in the hope of providing a valuable contribution to human understanding of Antarctic climate and potential for climate change. World Record Attempt. Parker Liautaud attempted to ski 640 km unsupported from the coast of Antarctica to the South Pole in 22 days, setting a “coast to Pole” speed record. At 19 years old, he also broke the record of the youngest person to ski to both the North and the South Poles. Live Communications. The Expedition was accompanied by a custom-built 6x6 communications truck outfitted with equipment that provided 24/7 connectivity to the rest of the world, enabling Paddy Scott, the expedition cameraman and photographer to document Liautaud and Stoup's journey in real time.
