The 2014 UEC European Track Championships was the fifth edition of the elite UEC European Track Championships in track cycling and took place at the Vélodrome Amédée Détraux in Baie-Mahault, Guadeloupe, France, between 16 and 19 October. The Event was organised by the European Cycling Union. All European champions are awarded the UEC European Champion jersey which may be worn by the champion throughout the year when competing in the same event at other competitions. The programme for the 2014 championships was considerably extended, and all World Championship track events were held; ten Olympic events, (sprint, team sprint, keirin, team pursuit and omnium, for both men and women), for which qualification points for the 2016 Summer Olympics were available for the first time, and nine non-Olympic events; the men's madison race and points races, scratch races, sprint time trials (1000 metres for men, 500 metres for women) and individual pursuits for both genders were held as part of the championships. The omnium was held in its new format for the first time, ending with the points race, rather than the sprint time trial. Unusually, the event was held on a fully outdoor concrete track with a 333-metre circumference, as opposed to the now standard 250 metre indoor wooden velodromes normally used in such events. As a result, several of the events (team sprints, omniums and points races) will be held over non-standard distances. In addition, the event took place outside continental Europe for the first time, being held in the French caribbean province department of Guadeloupe.
