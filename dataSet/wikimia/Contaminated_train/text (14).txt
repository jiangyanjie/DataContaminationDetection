Talking Statues is a project created initially in 2013 by David Peter Fox in Copenhagen, Denmark involving pre-recorded voiceovers accompanying various statues available in a smartphone app. The statue of Hans Christian Andersen in the King's Garden in Copenhagen was the first talking statue in the world. Later the idea was applied in Helsinki, New York, London, San Diego, Chicago, Vilnius, Parma, Dublin, Berlin, Manchester, and others. The project works with mobile technology and activated through a QR code found on the statue, when you scan it you will be called. You can also download our app, then you can find the Talking Statues in the world and have it talk to GPS so that they call you on your smartphone when you get close to the statue. The project started in Kings Garden in Copenhagen, where Fox accompanied his two children Alfred and Leah to kindergarten. On the way, they passed the many statues, including H. C. Andersen, who became the first Talking Statue in the world launched on 13th of September 2013. In connection with the launch, a leaflet designed by Mathilde Lunderskov was published with a map of the 10 Talking Statues. The monologues were written by film director Carsten Rudolf in collaboration with David Peter Fox and the performance was made by actor Jens Jacob Tychsen. The first project was overseen from the start by Jens Peter Munk from the Municipality, who has written several books about these statues in Copenhagen. The project in 2013 was supported by the City of Copenhagen
