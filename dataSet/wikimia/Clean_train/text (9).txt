A motion of no confidence in the Spanish government of Pedro Sánchez was tabled by the far-right party Vox on 27 February 2023, and will be debated and voted in the Congress of Deputies between 21 and 22 March 2023. It was the sixth motion of no confidence in Spain since the country's transition to democracy.Vox announced the motion of no confidence on 9 December 2022, proposing it to be tabled under an independent candidate with government experience, voicing that Sánchez's proposed reforms of the Criminal Code to modify the embezzlement and sedition crimes were akin to a "self-coup" similar to "that of Pedro Castillo in Peru" two days earlier. The opposition People's Party (PP) under Alberto Núñez Feijóo stated that it would not vote against the motion, unlike the 2020 vote, but it did not clarify whether it would abstain or vote in favour of it depending on the proposed candidate.After a period in which Vox was unable to get the consent of any of the candidates it reached out for, on 1 February 2023 the party proposed economist and former politician Ramón Tamames, aged 89, to lead the motion. Tamames accepted on 21 February, with the motion's registration being announced for the next Monday. His speech highlights the maneuvers against the separation of powers towards an "absorbing autocracy" with abuse of the decree-law, elimination of the crime of sedition or reduction of sentences for embezzlement, support in pro-independence parties, little conciliatory line of government, partisan manipulation of history, attacks on legal certainty and businessmen
