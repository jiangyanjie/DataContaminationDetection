he Republic of Poland and the Republic of Belarus established diplomatic relations on 2 March 1992.[1] Poland was one of the first countries to recognise Belarusian independence.[2] Both countries share a border and have shared histories, for they have been in the Russian Empire and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. They joined the United Nations together in October 1945 as original members. The two countries are currently engaged in a border crisis.

Cultural relations between the two are quite friendly but diplomatic relations between the two countries are currently very strained. Poland is a member of NATO and the European Union, and has an anti-Russian stance, whereas Belarus has long been firmly pro-Russia, and as such, the separate paths by default impair the positive bilateral relationship (see Russia–European Union relations). In August 2011, the arrest of Ales Bialiatski using information from Poland led to a harsh war of words between the two countries.[3][4] However, in February 2017 some tensions arose between Belarus and Russia over border controls, and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko expressed indignation at Russia's behaviour.
