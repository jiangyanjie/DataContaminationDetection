The company provides mail collection and delivery services throughout the UK. Letters and parcels are deposited in post or parcel boxes, or are collected in bulk from businesses and transported to Royal Mail sorting offices. Royal Mail owns and maintains the UK's distinctive and iconic red pillar boxes, first introduced in 1852 (12 years after the first postage stamp, Penny Black), and other post boxes, many of which bear the royal cypher of the reigning monarch at the date of manufacture.[3] Deliveries are made at least once every day except Sundays and bank holidays at uniform charges for all UK destinations. Royal Mail generally aims to make first class deliveries the next business day throughout the nation.[4]

For most of its history, the Royal Mail was a public service, operating as a government department or public corporation. Following the Postal Services Act 2011,[5][6] Royal Mail Group Limited became a wholly-owned subsidiary of a new holding company, Royal Mail plc; a majority of the shares in Royal Mail plc were floated on the London Stock Exchange in 2013.[7] Nine years later Royal Mail plc was renamed: it is now known as International Distribution Services (IDS; of which Royal Mail Group Limited remains a wholly-owned subsidiary).
