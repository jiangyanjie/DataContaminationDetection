On 10 January 2023, Constantine II of Greece, Head of the Royal House of Greece, who reigned as the last King of the Hellenes from 6 March 1964 to 1 June 1973, died in Athens at the age of 82. After suffering a stroke in hospital, Constantine was placed in intensive care, before dying days later. His death was initially announced by an Associated Press report, which referenced hospital staff, however Constantine's private office later released a formal death statement. The Greek government declined the royal family's request for a state funeral, although it was later decided that Constantine should have a lying-in-state and a funeral procession. On 16 January, Constantine's body was laid for public viewing in the Agios Eleftherios Chapel in Athens from 6:00 am to
