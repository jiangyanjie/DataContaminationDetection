The 2023 Backlash is the upcoming 18th Backlash professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It will be held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event will take place on Saturday, May 6, 2023, at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico Jos√© Miguel Agrelot in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
