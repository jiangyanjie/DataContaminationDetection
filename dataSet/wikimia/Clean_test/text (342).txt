The 16th Congress of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia El Hamra and Río de Oro (Arabic: المؤتمر السادس عشر للجبهة الشعبية لتحرير الساقية الحمراء ووادي الذهب, Spanish: XVI Congreso del Frente Popular para la Liberación de Saguia El Hamra y Río de Oro) was held in the Dajla refugee camp in Tindouf, Algeria between 13 and 22 January 2023 to renovate the governing bodies of the POLISARIO Front and establish the movement's main lines of action and strategy for the next leadership term. The Congress was also used to elect a new General-Secretary for the POLISARIO Front, which would automatically become the President of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. For the first time ever, the candidate for general-secretary was not agreed upon before the Congress.
