A motion of no confidence in the Spanish government of Pedro Sánchez was tabled by the far-right party Vox on 27 February 2023, and will be debated and voted in the Congress of Deputies between 21 and 22 March 2023. It was the sixth motion of no confidence in Spain since the country's transition to democracy.Vox announced the motion of no confidence on 9 December 2022, proposing it to be tabled under an independent candidate with government experience, voicing that Sánchez's proposed reforms of the Criminal Code to modify the embezzlement and sedition crimes were akin to a "self-coup" similar to "that of Pedro Castillo in Peru" two days earlier. The opposition People's Party (PP) under Alberto Núñez Feijóo stated that it would not vote against the motion,
