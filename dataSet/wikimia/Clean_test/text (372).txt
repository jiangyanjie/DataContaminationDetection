The APRA Music Awards of 2023 are the upcoming 41st annual series, known as the APRA Awards. The awards are given in a series of categories in three divisions and in separate ceremonies throughout the year: the APRA Music Awards, Art Music Awards and Screen Music Awards. The APRA Music Awards are provided by APRA AMCOS (Australasian Performing Right Association and Australasian Mechanical Copyright Owners Society) and celebrate excellence in contemporary music, honouring songwriters and publishers that have achieved artistic excellence and outstanding success in their fields. In January, 20 songs shortlisted for Song of the Year were announced. On 30 March 2023, the final nominations were provided. Winners of the 2023 Ted Albert Award for Outstanding Services to Australian Music were Colin Hay and Colleen Ironside. APRA
