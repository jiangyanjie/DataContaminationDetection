An indirect presidential election was held in Vietnam on 2 March 2023. The election took place early following the resignation of President Nguyễn Xuân Phúc as part of a broad anti-corruption purge led by the General Secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party Nguyễn Phú Trọng. The sole candidate running within Vietnam's one-party regime, Võ Văn Thưởng, was elected by the National Assembly of Vietnam.
