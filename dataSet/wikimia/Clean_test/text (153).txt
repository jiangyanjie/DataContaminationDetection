Triangle Derby I was the first annual round-robin six-woman tag team tournament event promoted by World Wonder Ring Stardom under the "Triangle Derby" branch. The event took place between January 3 and March 4, 2023, with limited attendance due in part to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic at the time (until January 30). It also represented the first major event promoted by Stardom in 2023.
