Tropical Cyclone Cheneso was a strong tropical cyclone that affected Madagascar in January 2023. The fourth tropical storm and fifth tropical cyclone of the 2022–23 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Cheneso developed out of a zone of disturbed weather status which was first monitored at RSMC La Réunion on 17 January. Despite convection wrapping into the curved band pattern, the system formed into a tropical depression on 18 January. The depression strengthened into Severe Tropical Storm Cheneso on the following day. Cheneso made landfall over northern Madagascar and weakened into an inland depression, before emerging into the Mozambique Channel. Cheneso later strengthened into a tropical cyclone on 25 January. The system continued moving southeast, before transitioning into a post-tropical depression on 29 January. The National Office for Risk
