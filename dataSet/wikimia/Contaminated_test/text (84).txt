Typhoon Hagupit (hə-goo-PEET, [hɐguˈpit]; Filipino word meaning "lashing or flogging"), known in the Philippines as Typhoon Ruby, was the second most intense tropical cyclone in 2014. Hagupit particularly impacted the Philippines in early December while gradually weakening, killing 18 people and causing $114 million (2014 USD) in the country. Prior to making landfall, Hagupit was considered the worst threat to the Philippines in 2014,
