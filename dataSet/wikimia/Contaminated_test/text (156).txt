MS Norman Atlantic was a roll-on/roll-off passenger (ROPAX) ferry owned by the Italian ferry company Visemar di Navigazione. The ferry was chartered by ANEK Lines from December 2014. On 28 December 2014, she caught fire in the Strait of Otranto, in the Adriatic Sea. At the time of the fire there were an estimated 475 people on board the ship including 417 passengers, 55 crew and at least three illegal immigrants. Of these, 452 people were rescued and the bodies of 11 were recovered. It is known that 16 passengers died and it was estimated that there were 28 deaths overall, the uncertainty arising from estimates of the number of illegal immigrants on board. Additionally, two crewmembers of the Albanian tug Iliria were killed during the salvage operations
