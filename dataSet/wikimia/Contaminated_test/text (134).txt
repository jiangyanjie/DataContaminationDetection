The Toronto Rock are a lacrosse team based in Toronto playing in the National Lacrosse League (NLL). The 2014 season was the 17th in franchise history, and 16th as the Rock. After an up-and-down start to the season, the Rock acquired goaltender Brandon Miller from the Philadelphia Wings at the trade deadline hoping to revitalize their shaky defense. On April 5, star forward Garrett Billings tore his ACL during a game against the Vancouver Stealth and was lost for the remainder of the season.
