Talking Statues is a project created initially in 2013 by David Peter Fox in Copenhagen, Denmark involving pre-recorded voiceovers accompanying various statues available in a smartphone app. The statue of Hans Christian Andersen in the King's Garden in Copenhagen was the first talking statue in the world. Later the idea was applied in Helsinki, New York, London, San Diego, Chicago, Vilnius, Parma, Dublin, Berlin, Manchester, and others. The project works with mobile technology and activated through a QR code found on the statue, when you scan it you will be called. You can also download our app, then you can find the Talking Statues in the world and have it talk to GPS so that they call you on your smartphone when you get close to the statue.
