Water supply problems in Caleta Olivia occurred on 2014 (called the Thirst Days) and culminated in a series of protests about the lack of water produced by the rupture of the aqueduct Jorge Carstens. The Sarmiento, Comodoro Rivadavia and Rada Tilly areas of Argentina were affected. The water shortage began on the 10th of February with a rupture near ti Cerro Drag√≥n (Dragon Hill).
