Simon Hall (1977 or 1978 â€“ 23 February 2014) was a British murderer who was wrongly helped by 'miscarriage of justice' campaigners, only for him to go on to confess to the murder he was convicted of and prove he was rightly convicted. Hall stabbed 79-year-old pensioner Joan Albert to death in her home in Capel St Mary, Suffolk in 2001, and was convicted of her murder two years later. Subsequently, the high-profile miscarriage of justice programme Rough Justice took up his case and aired a programme campaigning for him. Several MPs, Bristol University's 'Innocence Project' campaign group, his mother and girlfriend were also deceived into campaigning for him, and the Criminal Cases Review Commission (which had itself been set up in response to Rough Justice in 1997)
