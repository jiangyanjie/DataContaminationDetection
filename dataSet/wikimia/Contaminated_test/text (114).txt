In the afternoon of January 21, 2014, the Chinese internet suffered a major failure. The country's DNS infrastructure, which is responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses, started directing unrelated domains from various TLDs to the completely unresponsive IP address 65.49.2.178 at 15:10 (UTC+8). As a result, two-thirds of all domestic websites became non-functional, including such high-traffic sites as Baidu and Sina.It is debated what caused this incident. Chinese officials point to the fact that the IP address is owned by Dynamic Internet Technology, an American Falun Gong-affiliated corporation most known for developing the Great Firewall circumvention tool Freegate, and argue that it was caused by external hacking. Independent researchers, however, argue that the incident is more likely caused by a misconfiguration in Great Firewall's DNS poisoning
